Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in North America and the United Kingdom. A more detailed description of the Companys significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy generates revenue primarily by selling its oil and natural gas production and its refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and other countries. The Companys revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells. Also, because crude oil is purchased by the Company for refinery feedstocks, natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields, and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in North America that are primarily located at Wal Mart Supercenters, the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the Companys costs. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration. Profits and generation of cash in the Companys refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins, which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing, transporting and marketing these products. Murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions. Worldwide oil prices were generally higher in 2006 than in 2005, while the average sales price for North American natural gas was lower in 2006 than 2005. The average price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in 2006 was $66.00, an increase of 16% compared to 2005. The NYMEX natural gas price in 2006 averaged $6.74 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU), down 25% from 2005. Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company, especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately 88% of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis by the Company in 2006. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in 2007 or beyond, the Company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business. Such lower oil and gas prices could, but may not, have a favorable impact on the Companys refining and marketing operating profits. Results of Operations The Company had net income in 2006 of $638.3 million, $3.37 per diluted share, compared to net income in 2005 of $846.5 million, $4.51 per diluted share. In 2004 the Companys net income was $701.3 million, $3.75 per diluted share. The net income reduction in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily related to lower earnings generated by the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses. In addition, the net cost of corporate activities was higher in 2006 than in 2005. The higher net income in 2005 compared to 2004 was caused by a combination of better earnings in the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing operations and lower net costs for corporate activities. Further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections. Income from continuing operations was $638.3 million, $3.37 per diluted share, in 2006, $837.9 million, $4.46 per diluted share, in 2005, and $496.4 million, $2.65 per diluted share, in 2004. Income from discontinued operations was $8.6 million, $0.05 per diluted share, in 2005, and $204.9 million, $1.10 per diluted share, in 2004. There was no impact from discontinued operations in 2006. In the second quarter 2004 the Company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas properties in western Canada for cash proceeds of $583 million, which generated an after tax gain on the sale of $171.1 million in 2004. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the gain on sale of these assets and operating results for the fields prior to their sale have been presented, net of income tax expense, as Discontinued Operations in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 related to a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale of the western Canada properties in 2004. 15 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 Net income in 2006 was $638.3 million, $3.37 per diluted share, compared to $846.5 million, $4.51 per diluted share, in 2005. Net income in 2005 included income from discontinued operations of $8.6 million, which was $0.05 per share. The $208.2 million decline in net income in 2006 was primarily due to lower earnings in both the Companys exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M or Downstream) businesses, plus higher net costs for corporate activities. The Companys E&P earnings declined in 2006 due to several factors in the current year, including lower sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas caused by lower production levels for these products, lower natural gas sales prices in North America and higher production and administrative expenses. In addition, in 2005 the Company recorded an after tax gain of $104.5 million related to a sale of most mature oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The 2006 E&P results were favorably impacted by higher crude oil sales prices, lower after tax exploration expenses, lower hurricane related costs and higher income tax benefits due to various tax rate changes. Company wide, the net costs associated with hurricanes were $42.5 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005. Hurricane costs in the Companys R&M business were $59.8 million higher in 2006 due to more uninsured costs associated with repairs at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery, clean up of a crude oil spill that occurred at the refinery as a result of damages from Hurricane Katrina, and settlement of litigation associated with the oil spill. Hurricane costs in the Companys E&P business were lower in 2006 by $16.9 million due to lower costs in the current year for equipment and facilities repair, discretionary employee assistance and hurricane related insurance in the current year. Earnings in the R&M business were $105.1 million in 2006 compared to $125.3 million in 2005. This earnings reduction of $20.2 million in 2006 was primarily caused by the aforementioned higher hurricane related costs. Excluding the higher hurricane costs, U.S. downstream earnings improved in 2006 compared to 2005, while 2006 earnings for downstream operations in the U.K. were down $8.1 million from record levels in 2005. The Company continued to expand its retail gasoline station business by adding 123 sites in 2006, with virtually all such additions located at Wal Mart Supercenters. The net costs of corporate activities were $82.7 million in 2006 compared to $35.5 million in 2005. These costs increased mostly due to an educational assistance contribution commitment amounting to $25.1 million after tax, plus the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange movements as the U.S. dollar weakened against most other major currencies used by Companys operations, including the Euro and the U.K. pound sterling. In addition, corporate activity costs in 2006 were unfavorable because 2005 included income tax benefits of $9.7 million from settlement of U.S. income tax audits. Sales and other operating revenues in 2006 were $2.6 billion higher than in 2005 mostly due to higher sales volumes and sales prices in the current year for refined petroleum products. In addition, merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations increased in 2006 and the sales price of crude oil was higher in 2006. Sales revenue was unfavorably affected in 2006 by lower sales volumes of crude oil and lower sales volumes and prices for natural gas. Gain on sale of assets before income taxes amounted to $9.4 million in 2006 compared to $175.1 million in 2005. The prior year included a pretax gain of $165.0 million related to the sale of oil and natural gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. Interest and other income in 2006 was unfavorable to the prior year by $3.3 million due mostly to higher foreign exchange charges associated with the unfavorable effects of the U.S. dollar weakening against the Euro and pound sterling in the current year. Crude oil and product purchases expense increased by $2.4 billion in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher prices for crude oil and other purchased refinery feedstocks, higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations, and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at these gasoline stations. These higher costs were partially offset by lower volumes of crude oil purchased for feedstock in 2006 because the Meraux refinery was off line for repairs for the first five months of the year. Operating expenses increased by $254.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher repairs and other production expenses in the Companys E&P operations, higher costs of operating retail gasoline stations primarily due to more stations in operation, and higher refinery operating costs mostly associated with higher labor costs at the Companys Meraux refinery. Exploration expenses were lower in 2006 compared to 2005 by $13.2 million primarily due to lower dry hole charges in the current year in the Republic of Congo, but partially offset by higher dry hole and seismic and geophysical costs in the U.S. The reasons for higher costs associated with hurricanes in 2006 were included in the previous paragraph. Selling and general expenses increased $69.6 million in 2006 due to various factors in the year, including the pretax costs for an educational assistance contribution commitment, the costs of reorganizing the Companys U.S. E&P operations, higher costs for professional consultants, and the initial costs of expensing the grant date fair value of stock options which began in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $12.8 million lower in 2006 than 2005 generally due to lower volumes of crude oil and natural gas sold by the Companys E&P business. Depreciation expense in the downstream business was higher in 2006 mostly due to the continued addition of retail gasoline stations in the U.S. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by $1.2 million in 2006 mostly due to higher asset retirement obligations for Malaysian operations due to drilling development wells at the Kikeh field in 2006. Interest expense increased in 2006 by $5.2 million due to higher average borrowings under the Companys credit facilities. The amount of interest costs capitalized to development projects increased by $4.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher capitalized costs associated with the Kikeh field, offshore Sabah Malaysia, and the Thunder Hawk field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Income tax expense in 2006 was lower than in 2005 by $144.0 million due to lower pretax earnings in 2006 and net tax benefits in the 16 Table of Contents current year from changes in tax rates in various taxing jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings in 2006 was 37.9% and included a net benefit of $19.7 million (1.9% of pretax income) from the reduction of Federal and provincial tax rates in Canada offset in part by an increase in the tax rate on oil operations in the U.K. The effective tax rate in 2005 was 38.9% of consolidated pretax earnings. The tax rate in both years was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceed the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because the ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years is uncertain. 2005 vs. 2004 Net income in 2005 was $846.5 million, $4.51 per share, compared to $701.3 million, $3.75 per share, in 2004. Income from continuing operations was $837.9 million, $4.46 per share, in 2005 compared to $496.4 million, $2.65 per share, in 2004. The $341.5 million improvement in income from continuing operations in 2005 was caused by more favorable results in each of the Companys E&P and R&M operations and lower net costs for corporate activities. Higher sales prices in 2005 for the Companys oil and natural gas production was the primary driver for improved earnings of $235.8 million in the E&P business. The other favorable factors in this business in 2005 were higher oil sales volumes and a larger gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties. The Companys E&P earnings were unfavorably affected in 2005 by several factors, including higher insurance costs mostly caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, lower sales volumes for natural gas due to both the sale of properties in the Gulf of Mexico and downtime caused by the hurricanes, higher exploration expenses, lower income tax benefits and rising costs of supplies and services. R&M earnings were $125.3 million in 2005, up $43.4 million compared to 2004 due to stronger realized margins for petroleum products sold in the U.S. and U.K. The Company expanded its retail fuel operations in both the U.S. and U.K. in 2005 by adding 112 retail gasoline sites at Wal Mart Supercenters in the U.S. and by purchasing 68 existing retail fuel stations in the U.K. The net costs of corporate activities were $62.3 million lower in 2005 than in 2004, with the favorable variance in 2005 mostly due to a combination of higher tax benefits associated with refund and settlement of prior year U.S. taxes, lower Canadian withholding taxes on dividends to Murphy Oil Corporation from its Canadian subsidiary, favorable effects from foreign currency exchange, and less net interest costs due to lower average borrowings and the capitalization of more interest costs on development projects in the E&P business. These were partially offset by higher selling and general expenses in 2005, with the majority of this increase caused by larger employee compensation and benefit costs. The Company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas assets in western Canada in 2004, and net income in 2005 and 2004 included income from these discontinued operations of $8.6 million and $204.9 million, respectively, which represented per share earnings of $0.05 in 2005 and $1.10 in 2004. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 arose from a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale in 2004. In 2004, cash proceeds of $583 million from the property sale led to an after tax gain of $171.1 million, which is included in the 2004 amount above. Sales and other operating revenues in 2005 were $3.4 billion higher than in 2004 primarily due to higher sales prices for oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, higher sales volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products, and higher merchandise sales revenue at retail gasoline stations. Sales were unfavorably affected in 2005 by lower volumes of natural gas sold. The gain on sale of assets was $105.5 million higher in 2005, mostly due to a pretax gain of $165 million on the sale of oil and gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf in 2005, partially offset by pretax profits in 2004 on sale of various properties other than the western Canada assets included in discontinued operations. Interest and other income was favorable by $30.8 million in 2005 compared to 2004 mostly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange losses in 2004 that did not repeat in 2005 and higher interest income on a U.S. income tax refund in 2005. Crude oil and product purchases expense increased by $2.6 billion in 2005 due to higher prices for crude oil and other purchased refinery feedstocks and higher prices for refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations. Operating expenses increased $112.6 million in 2005 due mostly to costs associated with more crude oil production and more retail service stations in operation in the U.S. and U.K. Exploration expenses in the E&P business were $68.2 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 mostly due to more dry holes in Malaysia and the Republic of Congo, plus more spending on 3 D seismic acquisition and processing in Malaysia in 2005. Costs associated with hurricanes in 2005 of $66.8 million related to additional insurance, repairs and other costs that arose due to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico during the year. These storms, which damaged and temporarily shut down certain offshore U.S. oil and gas production facilities and the Meraux, Louisiana refinery, led to uninsured repair costs of about $15.5 million in 2005 and caused insurance costs in 2005 to rise by approximately $23.0 million. Also included in this cost category in 2005 was $19.5 million of ongoing Meraux refinery salaries, benefits, depreciation and maintenance costs while the refinery was shut down for repairs, and also donations and additional employee compensation totaling $8.8 million. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the increase in certain insurance costs related to the storm losses incurred by insurance companies was allocated to all segments of the Companys business as all assets were covered by this property insurance. Costs associated with hurricanes were $3.4 million in 2004. Selling and general expenses were $26.6 million more in 2005 mostly due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $75.4 million higher in 2005 due to more volumes of crude oil sold and more fueling stations operating in the 17 Table of Contents U.S. and U.K. The Company is experiencing higher drilling and other capital costs, which appear to be caused by added demand for such services due to the higher level of oil and natural gas sales prices. Accretion of asset retirement obligations was down $0.3 million in 2005 due to sales of oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. Interest expense was down by $8.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to lower average outstanding debt in 2005. The portion of interest expense capitalized to development projects rose by $16.4 million in 2005 primarily due to higher interest allocated to the Kikeh development in Malaysia and the Syncrude expansion in western Canada. Income tax expense was up $225.6 million in 2005 mostly due to higher pretax earnings. The effective income tax rate as a percentage of pretax income in 2005 of 38.9% was unfavorably impacted by no tax benefits recognized on exploration expenses incurred in the Republic of Congo and Blocks PM 311/312 and H in Malaysia, but was favorably affected by income tax benefits of $21.8 million mostly related to refund and settlement of prior year U.S. income tax matters. Segment Results In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2006 are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 Exploration and production United States $ 212.4 385.5 159.5 Canada 329.7 308.2 232.2 United Kingdom 60.7 79.9 87.1 Ecuador 38.4 38.1 6.6 Malaysia (5.9 ) (4.7 ) 38.3 Other (19.4 ) (58.9 ) (11.4 ) 615.9 748.1 512.3 Refining and marketing North America 73.4 85.5 53.4 United Kingdom 31.7 39.8 28.5 105.1 125.3 81.9 Corporate (82.7 ) (35.5 ) (97.8 ) Income from continuing operations 638.3 837.9 496.4 Income from discontinued operations 8.6 204.9 Net income $ 638.3 846.5 701.3 Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production operations were $615.9 million in 2006, $748.1 million in 2005 and $512.3 million in 2004. The $132.2 million reduction in 2006 earnings compared to 2005 was mostly attributable to lower production of crude oil and natural gas, which led to lower sales volumes for these products. Lower natural gas sales prices and higher production and administrative expenses in 2006 and a $104.5 million after tax gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 also were factors that led to lower E&P earnings in the current year. E&P earnings in 2006 were favorably impacted by higher realized oil sales prices, lower exploration expenses, lower hurricane related expenses and income tax benefits associated with tax rate changes enacted in the current year. Crude oil sales volumes were down in 2006 by 13% compared to 2005, while natural gas sales volumes were down by 17%. Oil sales volumes were lower in 2006 primarily due to lower production at the Front Runner and Habanero fields in the Gulf of Mexico caused by weaker field performances, lower production at the Terra Nova field, offshore Newfoundland, due to the field being shut in for six months for major equipment repairs, and lower production at West Patricia, offshore Sarawak Malaysia, due to a lower volumetric sharing percentage allocable to the Company as the field matures. The decline in natural gas sales volumes in 2006 was attributable to both the mid 2005 sale of mature gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and lower production in the current year from gas fields onshore south Louisiana. The Companys average worldwide realized crude oil sales price increased 14% in 2006, while the average realized sales price for North American natural gas decreased 10%. The higher earnings in 2005 versus 2004 were due to a 26% higher average realized oil sales price, a 33% higher average realized sales price for natural gas in North America, a 16% increase in worldwide oil sales volumes from continuing operations, and higher gains on sale of mature properties. These favorable variances were somewhat offset by an 18% lower volume of natural gas sales from continuing operations, higher exploration expenses, higher production and depreciation expenses, higher insurance and repair costs after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and lower income tax benefits in Malaysia. The 2005 period included a $104.5 million after tax gain on sale of most oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil production in 2005 was primarily caused by a full year of production at 18 Table of Contents the Front Runner field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and higher heavy oil production from the Seal area in western Canada in response to an ongoing development drilling program. Natural gas sales volume declined in 2005 versus 2004 mostly due to the sale of properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and more downtime in the Gulf of Mexico caused by hurricane shut in and repairs. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 38 and F 39 of this Form 10 K report. Average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 6 of the 2006 Annual Report. A summary of oil and gas revenues from continuing operations, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 United States Oil and gas liquids $ 440.1 448.8 248.4 Natural gas 160.4 216.6 207.6 Canada Conventional oil and gas liquids 476.0 519.7 403.3 Natural gas 24.1 29.7 28.7 Synthetic oil 270.0 224.7 174.2 United Kingdom Oil and gas liquids 156.8 159.8 146.8 Natural gas 23.3 19.9 11.4 Malaysia crude oil 219.6 232.9 167.2 Ecuador crude oil 122.7 116.6 30.8 Total oil and gas revenues $ 1,893.0 1,968.7 1,418.4 The Companys crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged 87,817 barrels per day in 2006, 101,349 barrels per day in 2005 and 93,634 barrels per day in 2004. Production of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids was 13% lower in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to lower volumes produced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore eastern Canada. U.S. oil production of 21,112 barrels per day in 2006 was down by 18% from 2005 levels. The reduction in the U.S. related to lower volumes at two deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico Front Runner and Habanero and oil volumes produced in 2005 from fields on the continental shelf that were sold in the middle of that year. Front Runner has experienced a series of well failures that require intervention work. Habanero production decreased due to decline at the most productive onstream well during 2006. U.S. oil production in 2006 was virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes, while 2005 volumes were adversely affected by downtime associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Production offshore the East Coast of Canada comes from two fields Hibernia and Terra Nova. Terra Nova was off production for about one half of 2006 for major equipment repairs. The floating production, storage and offloading vessel was taken to Europe for turnaround and production restarted in mid November 2006. Production at Terra Nova was 3,900 barrels per day in 2006, down 64% from 2005 levels. Production at Hibernia totaled 10,996 barrels per day, which was 10% below 2005, with the decline due primarily to more downtime for equipment reliability issues in 2006. Total heavy oil production in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) increased 7% in 2006 and totaled 12,613 barrels per day. This increase was attributable to an ongoing development drilling program during 2006 at the Seal field in Alberta. Light oil production in the WCSB fell 21% to 443 barrels per day in 2006 mostly due to less condensate produced at the Rimbey gas field in Alberta. Synthetic oil production at Syncrude increased 10% in 2006 and was 11,701 barrels per day. A third coker unit was started up during 2006, and the new unit permits a larger volume of bitumen to be processed at the plant. The new coker experienced various start up issues, but was operating near capacity at year end 2006. All oil production in Malaysia during 2006 came from the West Patricia and adjoining Congkak fields in Block SK 309 offshore Sarawak. Net oil production from Malaysia was 11,298 barrels per day in 2006, 16% lower than in 2006 as the production sharing contract allocates a smaller portion of gross production to the Companys account in both a higher price environment and as prior costs are recovered. Gross production volumes at the Malaysian fields fell only 5% in 2006. A major oil field known as Kikeh in Block K offshore Sabah, Malaysia is scheduled to start up in the second half of 2007. Oil production offshore the United Kingdom fell 11% to 7,146 barrels per day. The most significant U.K. decline in 2006 occurred at the Schiehallion field and was primarily caused by a fire at the facilities used by this field. Total net oil produced at Block 16 in Ecuador was 8,608 barrels per day in 2006, a 9% increase from 2005 as a development drilling campaign continued in 2006. Oil sales volumes in Ecuador significantly exceeded production in 2006 due to recovering 853,000 barrels of oil for sale in settlement of a dispute with partners over 2004 oil production that was originally withheld from the Company. 19 Table of Contents Oil production in 2005 was an annual record for Murphy Oil. The 8% increase in worldwide oil production in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher volumes in the United States, Malaysia and Canada. U.S. oil production was 34% higher in 2005 and totaled 25,897 barrels per day, with the increase mostly due to a full year of production from the Front Runner field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Green Canyon Blocks 338/339. The first well at Front Runner came on stream in December 2004 and additional wells were completed and started up during 2005 and into early 2006. Production in the U.S. was hampered during 2005 by the effects of hurricanes as minor damages to the Companys Medusa and Habanero facilities and damages to product evacuation lines and other facilities downstream caused shut in of production for up to three months. Production offshore Sarawak, Malaysia at the West Patricia and Congkak fields increased 14% in 2005 to 13,503 barrels per day. The increase was mostly due to a 31% increase in gross production from these fields, but this was partially offset by a lower revenue sharing percentage for the Company under the terms of the production sharing contract. Heavy oil production in Canada essentially doubled to 11,806 barrels per day in 2005 due to an ongoing development drilling program in the Seal area and a full year of production from wells acquired in late 2004 in this area. Production at the Hibernia field off the east coast of Canada was down 4% to 12,278 barrels per day and production at the Terra Nova field in this area was off 14% in 2005 and amounted to 10,846 barrels per day. Lower production at Terra Nova was primarily caused by more downtime for equipment maintenance and repairs and a higher royalty rate. Production of synthetic oil at Syncrude netted the Company 10,593 barrels per day in 2005, down 10% from 2004 due to more downtime for equipment repairs. Total oil production offshore the United Kingdom was 7,992 barrels per day in 2005, down 27%. About 1,200 barrels per day of this decline was attributable to the sale of the T Block field in 2004. The majority of the remaining decline was at the Schiehallion field where a fire and other operational issues reduced average net production volumes by about 1,600 barrels per day. Production in Ecuador was 7,871 barrels per day in 2005, up 2% from 2004. Oil sales volumes in Ecuador in 2005 were significantly higher than production volumes due to receiving 663,000 barrels of oil for sale in settlement of a 2004 dispute with the operator of Block 16. Worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were 75.3 million cubic feet per day in 2006, 90.2 million in 2005 and 109.5 million in 2004. Sales of natural gas in the United States were 56.8 million cubic feet per day in 2006, 70.5 million in 2005 and 88.6 million in 2004. The reduced U.S. natural gas sales volume in 2006 of 19% was attributable to a combination of lower volumes produced onshore south Louisiana due to field decline and volumes produced in 2005 at Gulf of Mexico continental shelf fields that were sold in mid 2005. The Seventeen Hands field in Mississippi Canyon Block 299 came onstream in 2006, and volumes from this field served to essentially offset lower volumes at other deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, including Tahoe, Front Runner and Habanero. U.S. natural gas sales volumes in 2006 were virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes, while volumes in 2005 were adversely affected by downtime associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Natural gas sales volumes in Canada were 9.8 million cubic feet per day in 2006, 10.3 million in 2005 and 14.0 million in 2004. The 6% reduction in natural gas sales volumes in western Canada in 2006 was mostly caused by normal field decline in the Rimbey area. Natural gas sales volumes in the United Kingdom in 2006 were 8.7 million cubic feet per day, while 2005 and 2004 volumes were 9.4 million and 6.9 million, respectively. The 2006 decline of 8% for natural gas sales volumes in the U.K. was wholly attributable to make up gas volumes sold in 2005 at the Amethyst field that were associated with under sold production in earlier years. Excluding the make up volumes in 2005, U.K. natural gas sales volumes in 2006 would have exceeded 2005 amounts. Natural gas sales volume declined by 21% in the U.S. in 2005 due to the sale of most properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico in mid 2005, which caused a decrease of 14 million cubic feet per day, and the effects of Hurricane Katrina and other Gulf of Mexico storms that caused shut ins that reduced production by an average of about 15 million cubic feet per day for the year. These were partially offset by higher volumes due to ramp up of production at the Front Runner field throughout 2005. Sales volumes in 2004 were unfavorably affected by Hurricane Ivan which temporarily shut in most production in the central Gulf of Mexico and severely damaged certain facilities, such as at the Tahoe field in Viosca Knoll Block 783, which was shut in for the entire fourth quarter 2004 following the storm. Canadian gas sales volumes decreased 26% in 2005 compared to 2004 mostly due to normal field decline at Rimbey area wells. U.K. natural gas sales volumes in 2005 were up 37% with most of the increase due to higher sales volumes at the Amethyst field primarily caused by make up gas sold in 2005 that related to a prior years contract. Worldwide crude oil sales prices have risen in each of the last two years due to the combination of a strong world economy, real and perceived instability in worldwide crude oil production levels, and effective production output controls by OPEC producers. The Company realized an average per barrel sales price of $51.63 for crude oil and condensate in 2006, up 14% from the 2005 average of $45.25 per barrel. The average realized oil sales price in 2006 in the U.S. was up 21% at $57.30 per barrel. The average sales price of Canadian heavy oil was $25.87 per barrel, also a 21% increase compared to 2005. Realized average prices per barrel for Hibernia and Terra Nova oil sales in 2006 were $63.48 and $59.79, respectively, with each up about 20% from 2005 averages. Synthetic oil production was sold at $63.23 per barrel in 2006, up 9% from 2005 prices. The realized sales price for synthetic oil did not rise as much as other oil because of higher volumes of similar crudes available in the market for which demand did not keep pace with the growth. Average 20 Table of Contents crude oil prices in Malaysia of $51.78 per barrel in 2006 was 12% higher than 2005, while U.K. prices for the latest year rose 22% to $64.30 per barrel. The average oil price realized in Ecuador of $33.79 per barrel rose only 4% from 2005 as the Ecuadorian government passed a revenue sharing law that became effective in April 2006. Oil producers in Ecuador must now revenue share 50% of average realized prices that exceed a benchmark price that escalates with the inflation rate as measured monthly by the U.S. Consumer Price Index. At year end 2006, this benchmark oil price for Block 16 Ecuador was approximately $23.27 per barrel. Murphy realized an average worldwide crude oil and condensate sales price of $45.25 per barrel in 2005, a 26% increase from the 2004 realized average price of $35.92 per barrel. The average realized price in 2005 for crude oil and condensate sold in the U.S. was $47.48 per barrel, an increase of 34% over 2004. The average price for 2005 Canadian heavy oil sales was $21.30 per barrel, up 5% from 2004, and was adversely affected by higher costs of diluent and a wider heavy oil discount in the year. The average selling price in 2005 for Hibernia and Terra Nova production offshore eastern Canada was $51.37 per barrel, an increase of 40%. The synthetic oil production sales price rose 44% in 2005 and averaged $58.12 per barrel. Sales prices in 2005 for U.K. North Sea oil was up 43% to $52.83 per barrel. Ecuador sales prices averaged $32.54 per barrel in 2005 and Malaysia prices were $46.16 per barrel; these prices increased 31% and 12%, respectively. Malaysian prices were unfavorably affected by price sharing payments required in periods of high oil prices in accordance with the terms of the production sharing contract for Block SK 309. North American natural gas sale prices did not rise in tandem with higher crude oil prices in 2006 as U.S. natural gas storage levels exceeded normal levels during most of the year, primarily due to milder average temperature across much of the U.S. during the period. North American gas sales prices averaged $7.57 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2006, down 10% from 2005 averages. The sales price for natural gas in the U.K. was up 27% and averaged $7.34 per MCF. The 2005 sales prices for natural gas in the Companys gas producing markets were stronger than in 2004. The Companys sales price of North American natural gas averaged $8.44 per MCF in 2005, an increase of 33% from 2004. In the U.K., the average sales price for natural gas was $5.80 per MCF, up 28% from 2004. Based on 2006 sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1.00 per barrel and $0.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by $20.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. Production expenses were $384.6 million in 2006, $305.4 million in 2005 and $249.0 million in 2004. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 38 and F 39 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel excluding discontinued operations during the last three years are shown in the following table. (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2006 2005 2004 United States $ 7.10 5.17 6.14 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 9.36 4.40 3.06 Synthetic oil 28.54 25.09 18.05 United Kingdom 6.19 5.10 4.25 Malaysia 7.46 6.98 5.63 Ecuador 7.85 7.07 11.18 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 7.91 5.31 4.89 Production cost per equivalent barrel increased in the United States in 2006 mostly due to higher insurance costs coupled with lower overall production. The lower cost per equivalent barrel in the U.S. in 2005 was primarily due to start up of the Front Runner field in late 2004 and sale of higher cost properties in the Gulf of Mexico in mid 2005. The per unit costs for Canadian conventional oil and gas operations, excluding Syncrude, rose significantly in 2006 due to lower production volumes and higher repair costs at Terra Nova, which was shut in for about six months for major equipment repairs, plus a higher mix of more costly heavy oil production versus lighter oils. The increase in costs in Canada excluding synthetic oil in 2005 was due to a growing heavy oil production profile, lower production volume at the Terra Nova field and a higher foreign exchange rate. Higher production costs per barrel for synthetic oil operations in 2006 were mostly attributable to higher coker repair costs and higher compensation costs. The higher rate per barrel for Canadian synthetic oil operations in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to unfavorable maintenance, energy and compensation costs coupled with lower production and a higher foreign exchange rate. Higher 2006 costs per barrel produced in the U.K. and Malaysia were mostly attributable to higher facility maintenance costs. The higher average U.K. cost in 2005 was mostly due to higher maintenance costs and lower production at the Schiehallion and Mungo/Monan fields. The increase in the unit rate in 21 Table of Contents Malaysia in 2005 was due to higher fuel and export duty costs. Higher per unit operating costs in Ecuador in 2006 compared to 2005 were mostly attributable to higher field operating costs in the Amazon region where Block 16 is located. Lower average costs per barrel in Ecuador in 2005 were due mostly to a new, less expensive arrangement for pipeline transportation that began near year end 2004. Exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 38 and F 39 on this Form 10 K report. Certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2006 2005 2004 Exploration and production Dry holes $ 111.0 126.0 110.9 Geological and geophysical 73.1 73.4 28.4 Other 12.6 10.2 8.6 196.7 209.6 147.9 Undeveloped lease amortization 22.5 22.8 16.4 Total exploration expenses $ 219.2 232.4 164.3 Dry holes expense was $15.0 million lower in 2006 than 2005 mostly due to less unsuccessful wildcat drilling in the Republic of Congo in the current year, but partially offset by higher unsuccessful drilling costs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Dry hole expense was up $15.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004 as dry hole costs offshore the Republic of Congo and Malaysia were only partially offset by lower costs in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore eastern Canada. Geological and geophysical (G&G) expenses in 2006 were about the same as in 2005 as higher current year costs in the Gulf of Mexico were essentially offset by lower spending offshore eastern Canada. G&G expenses were higher by $45.0 million in 2005 compared to 2004 mostly due to more 3 D seismic acquisition and processing costs in Blocks SK 309/311 and PM 311/312, offshore Malaysia. Other exploration costs in 2006 were $2.4 million higher than in 2005 mostly due to higher administrative costs for international exploration activities. Other exploration expenses were $1.6 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 due mostly to more administrative costs in the Republic of Congo. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense in 2006 was virtually flat with 2005, while such costs increased by $6.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004 because of lease acquisitions in the Gulf of Mexico, a lease relinquishment in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 and the acquisition in 2004 of two exploration concessions in the deep waters offshore the Republic of Congo. Costs of $1.9 million, $18.8 million and $2.6 million were incurred in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in the Companys exploration and production operations for uninsured costs to repair damages and to recognize associated higher insurance costs caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, these costs were adversely affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and also included discretionary assistance to employees in the New Orleans area after Hurricane Katrina. In 2004, the Company also recorded costs of $12.6 million for retrospective insurance premiums related to past claims experience of an insurance provider. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled $297.0 million in 2006, $319.1 million in 2005 and $241.5 million in 2004. The $22.1 million reduction in 2006 compared to 2005 was attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales volumes in the current year, but partially offset by generally higher per barrel capital amortization caused by higher costs for development operations and negative U.S. reserve revisions. The $77.6 million increase in 2005 versus 2004 was due to more crude oil production and higher per barrel costs in most areas generally caused by higher capital costs incurred to find and develop oil and natural gas reserves. Despite a weakening of oil prices in early 2007, the Company continues to experience high drilling and related costs caused by a strong demand for such services. The exploration and production business recorded expenses of $10.8 million in 2006, $9.6 million in 2005 and $9.9 million in 2004 for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities. Because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment. The higher accretion costs incurred in 2006 were mostly associated with retirement obligations incurred on development wells drilled at the Kikeh field during 2006. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was 36.1% in 2006, 39.1% in 2005 and 32.7% in 2004. Although the 2006 effective tax rate was only slightly higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, the annual rate was lower than in 2005 mostly due to net benefits from tax rate changes. In 2006 the Canadian federal government and the Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces reduced their tax rates on oil and gas company profits, which led to a recognition of tax benefits of $37.5 million in 2006 mostly due to reducing recorded deferred income tax liabilities. In 22 Table of Contents 2006, the U.K. government increased tax rates on oil and gas company profits from 40% to 50%, which increased income tax expense in the U.K. by $17.8 million in 2006. The effective tax rate in 2005 was higher than the average U.S. statutory rate due to unrecognized income tax benefits on certain exploration and other expenses in Malaysia and the Republic of Congo. Each main exploration area in Malaysia is currently ring fenced and no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for Blocks H, P, L and M, offshore Sabah, and Blocks PM 311/312, offshore Peninsula Malaysia. The effective tax rate in 2004 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate partially due to recognition of deferred income tax benefits in Malaysia of $31.9 million, which arose due to the expectation that temporary differences associated with exploration and other expenses incurred in Block K Malaysia will be utilized to reduce future taxable income. This benefit had not been recognized in the income statement before 2004 because the Company had established a deferred tax valuation allowance until such time that it became probable that these expenses would be utilized as deductions to reduce future taxable income. In 2004 the province of Alberta reduced its tax rate for oil and gas companies which generated a $4.9 million benefit in that year. At December 31, 2006, approximately 39% of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 52% of the U.S. proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped. Virtually all of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves (on a barrel of oil equivalent basis) are associated with the Companys various deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. Further drilling, facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed. In addition in Malaysia, all oil and natural gas reserves of 47.5 million barrels and 74.6 billion cubic feet at year end 2006 for the Kikeh field in Block K are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling prior to first production, which is projected to occur in the second half of 2007 for oil and in early 2008 for natural gas. Also in Malaysia, there were 262.9 billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore Sarawak at year end 2006, pending completion of drilling and facilities. First gas production at these Sarawak fields is expected in the first half of 2009. On a worldwide basis, the Company spent approximately $560 million in 2006, $378 million in 2005 and $272 million in 2004 to develop proved reserves. The Company expects to spend about $714 million in 2007, $485 million in 2008 and $99 million in 2009 to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing (R&M) operations generated earnings of $105.1 million in 2006, $125.3 million in 2005 and $81.9 million in 2004. The 16% decline in earnings during the current year was primarily due to hurricane related after tax costs of $67.1 million and lower crude oil throughput volumes at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery. In late August 2005, the Meraux refinery experienced severe flooding and wind damage associated with Hurricane Katrina and was shut down from late August 2005 through mid 2006. The hurricane related costs in 2006 were partially offset by stronger refining margins generated by the Superior, Wisconsin refinery and continued growth in the Companys North American retail gasoline marketing activities. In 2005, R&M earnings increased 53% compared to 2004. In North America, earnings improved 60% mostly due to stronger marketing margins, while in the U.K. income improved 40% due to stronger margins in both refining and marketing. The Companys North American R&M operations generated earnings of $73.4 million in 2006, $85.5 million in 2005 and $53.4 million in 2004. North American operations include refining activities in the United States and marketing activities in the United States and Canada. The 2006 and 2005 operating results for the Companys North American refining business were negatively impacted by hurricane related costs and below optimal Meraux refinery crude throughput volumes as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Uninsured damages, higher insurance premiums, settlement of the class action oil spill litigation and other hurricane related pretax costs in the Companys North American operations were $107.3 million in 2006, compared to pretax hurricane costs of $46.3 million in 2005. In 2006, the Meraux refinery throughput volumes for crude oil and other feedstocks averaged 57,198 barrels per day, compared to an average throughput of 75,443 and 107,622 barrels per day in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Significant flooding and wind damage associated with Hurricane Katrina resulted in the refinery being shut down from late August 2005 through mid 2006. During the refinerys nine months of downtime, major upgrades and improvements were completed in conjunction with the hurricane related repairs, including turnarounds on the refinerys hydrocracker and fluid catalytic cracking unit debutanizer. Meraux refinery throughput volumes increased to approximately 117,000 barrels per day following the debutanizer turnaround in December 2006. The Companys refinery in Superior, Wisconsin generated record earnings for the year as a result of steady operations and the continued strength of industry refining margins in North America. The 2006 operating results for the Companys North American retail operations remained strong, with higher average fuel and non fuel sales volumes at its retail sites as well as continued additions to the number of stations in operation. Retail fuel sales volumes increased 22% in 2006 compared to fuel sales volumes in 2005. The Company increased the size of its retail gasoline operations in 2006 by adding 123 Murphy USA fueling stations in the parking lots of Wal Mart Supercenters in a 21 state area. This resulted in a 14% increase in the number of sites at year end 2006 compared to 2005. 23 Table of Contents Operating results for the Companys refining business in 2005 were slightly better than 2004. During the first eight months of 2005 the Company benefited from strong industry refining margins due to increased demand for gasoline and distillates fueled by the robust U.S. economy. Higher refinery margins for both the Meraux and Superior refineries were mostly offset by the effects of four months of lost production and $29.0 million of after tax hurricane related costs at the Meraux refinery following Hurricane Katrina. Operating results for the North American retail gasoline marketing operations were stronger in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a combination of higher per gallon fuel margins, higher average per site fuel and non fuel sales volumes and the continued addition of sites. In 2005, the Company increased the size of its retail fuel operations by adding 112 Murphy USA fueling stations at Wal Mart Supercenters, leading to a 15% increase in the number of sites at year end 2005 compared to 2004. Unit margins (sales realization less costs of crude and other feedstocks, transportation to point of sale and refinery operating and depreciation expenses) averaged $3.48 per barrel in North America in 2006, $2.96 in 2005 and $2.25 in 2004. Despite the reduced throughputs at the Meraux refinery, North American refined product sales volumes increased 9% to a record 350,057 barrels per day in 2006, following a 7% increase to 322,171 barrels per day in 2005. The Companys North American retail gasoline marketing operations continued to increase per site fuel sales volumes with a 6% increase in the average monthly fuel sales volume per site in 2006 following a 9% increase in 2005. Operations in the United Kingdom generated earnings of $31.7 million in 2006, compared to $39.8 million in 2005 and $28.5 million in 2004. The decrease in 2006 earnings was due primarily to lower refinery margins as a result of higher operating and transportation costs in the current year and nonrecurring credits in 2005 for property tax rebates and insurance settlements. The decline in refinery earnings in 2006 was partially offset by stronger marketing margins and higher marketing sales volumes as a result of the contribution from 68 retail sites acquired in 2005. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $6.39 per barrel in 2006, $6.36 per barrel in 2005 and $4.85 per barrel in 2004. Overall sales of refined products declined 2% in 2006, following a decline of 4% in 2005. The decline in 2006 sales volumes was primarily due to lower demand for refined products based on higher average sales prices, while the decline in 2005 was due to lower production at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery as a result of a planned turnaround. Based on sales volumes for 2006 and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $0.42 per barrel ($0.01 per gallon) fluctuation in the unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by $37.1 million. The effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys exploration and production segments could be affected differently. Corporate The after tax costs of corporate activities, which include interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, were $82.7 million in 2006, $35.5 million in 2005, and $97.8 million in 2004. Net corporate costs were $47.2 million higher in 2006 than 2005 primarily due to a $25.1 million after tax educational assistance contribution commitment recorded in 2006, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and lower income tax benefits in 2006. The educational assistance commitment, known as the El Dorado Promise, involves the Companys unconditional commitment to contribute $5.0 million per year for the next 10 years to pay for post secondary tuition for eligible graduates of El Dorado High School in Arkansas. The U.S. dollar weakened by 14% against the U.K. pound sterling and 12% against the Euro during 2006. The U.S. dollar exchange rate against the Canadian dollar was not significantly different in 2006 compared to 2005. The after tax earnings effect of the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 was $7.9 million, while the foreign exchange effect on 2005 was insignificant. The 2005 corporate results included $9.7 million of income tax benefits due to refund and settlement of prior year U.S. income tax matters. Interest income was higher by $4.9 million in 2006 mostly due to interest collected on favorable settlements of prior year lawsuits and other disagreements with partners on E&P projects in Ecuador and western Canada. Administrative expenses in the corporate area were $40.2 million higher in 2006 mostly due to the educational assistance commitment, plus higher costs associated with initial recognition of the grant date fair value of stock options beginning in 2006. These higher administrative expenses were partially offset in 2006 by lower other incentive compensation costs. Interest expense was $5.2 million higher in 2006 mostly due to higher average outstanding borrowings under credit facilities. The portion of interest capitalized to development projects increased by $4.5 million in 2006 due mostly to higher capital spending on the Kikeh field development, offshore Sabah, Malaysia, and for the Thunder Hawk field in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by lower interest capitalized on the now completed expansion at Syncrude. Net after tax corporate costs were $62.3 million lower in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement in 2005 was attributable to favorable income tax benefits, higher interest income, lower net interest expense and more favorable foreign exchange impacts. These favorable effects were partially offset by higher administrative expenses in 2005. Income taxes were favorable by $23 million in the corporate area in 2005 due to lower net pretax costs and income tax benefits of $9.7 million, mostly due to refund and settlement of prior year U.S. income tax matters. In 2004, the Company 24 Table of Contents incurred tax costs of $27.5 million for a 5% withholding tax on a dividend from a Canadian subsidiary. Interest income was favorable by $3.8 million in 2005 due mainly to interest received on the 2005 U.S. income tax refunds. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized to various development projects, was $25.3 million lower in 2005 than in 2004. Interest expense incurred was $8.9 million less in 2005 due to lower average borrowing levels, while amounts capitalized to major development projects such as the Syncrude expansion and Kikeh development increased by $16.4 million. The effects of foreign exchange resulted in an after tax expense of $18.6 million in 2004, but these effects were insignificant in 2005. The unfavorable result for foreign exchange in 2004 was caused by a significant weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, pound sterling and Euro currencies during that year. Administrative expenses in the corporate area were $15 million higher in 2005 than in 2004. The cost increase in 2005 was mostly attributable to higher executive compensation expense and higher salaries and benefits, with partial offsets due to lower Sarbanes Oxley compliance consulting costs. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 14 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures for continuing operations, including exploration expenditures, were $1,262.5 million in 2006 compared to $1,329.8 million in 2005 and $975.4 million in 2004. These amounts included $196.7 million, $209.6 million and $147.9 million, respectively, in 2006, 2005 and 2004 for exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled $1,082.8 million in 2006, $1,092.0 million in 2005 and $839.2 million in 2004, representing 86%, 82% and 86%, respectively, of the Companys total capital expenditures for these years. E&P capital expenditures in 2006 included $13.9 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, $338.0 million for exploration activities, and $730.9 million for development projects. Development expenditures included $65.7 million for deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico; $387.9 million for the Kikeh field in Malaysia; $42.2 million for synthetic oil expansion and other capital at the Syncrude project in Canada; $89.7 million for western Canada heavy oil and natural gas projects; and $42.1 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 37 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled $173.4 million in 2006, compared to $202.4 million in 2005 and $134.7 million in 2004. These amounts represented 14%, 15% and 14% of capital expenditures for continuing operations of the Company in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Refining capital spending was $57.3 million in 2006 compared to $34.1 million in 2005 and $46.1 million in 2004. The bulk of the refining capital in 2006 was spent at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery where numerous capital improvements were completed while the plant was shut down for repairs following Hurricane Katrina. In 2004, the Company completed the construction of a green gasoline unit to produce ultra low sulfur gasoline at its Superior, Wisconsin refinery, with capital spending in that year for this project of $18.0 million. Marketing expenditures amounted to $116.1 million in 2006, $168.2 million in 2005 and $88.6 million in 2004. The majority of marketing expenditures in each year was related to construction of retail gasoline stations at Wal Mart Supercenters in 21 states in the U.S. The Company added 123 total stations to this retail station network in 2006, 112 in 2005 and 129 in 2004. In 2005, the Company also purchased 68 retail fueling stations in the U.K., thereby expanding its company owned retail station count by 70%. Cash Flows Cash provided by continuing operations was $962.7 million in 2006, $1,216.7 million in 2005 and $1,035.1 million in 2004. Cash provided by operations in 2006 was about $254 million lower than in 2005 and was unfavorably affected by higher spending in 2006 for inventories, prepaid insurance, and repair costs at the Meraux refinery, where the Company is awaiting anticipated reimbursements from insurance companies of $72.8 million at December 31, 2006. In addition, 2006 cash provided by operations was unfavorably affected by lower oil and natural gas sales volumes and higher operating costs associated with repairs of oil and gas production facilities. The increase in cash provided by continuing operations in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product sales volumes and higher sales prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Cash provided by continuing operations was reduced by expenditures for refinery turnarounds and abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $16.1 million in 2006, $31.9 million in 2005 and $18.6 million in 2004. A complete scheduled turnaround occurred at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery in 2005. Cash proceeds from property sales other than from discontinued operations were $23.8 million in 2006, $172.7 million in 2005 and $60.4 million in 2004. The sales proceeds in 2006 primarily related to sales of various properties, real estate and aircraft. The 2005 sales proceeds were mostly attributable to sale of most oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico; the Company retained its deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties. The 2004 property sales included the disposal of the T Block field in the U.K. North Sea and certain U.S. onshore gas properties and U.S. marketing terminals. Property sales which have been classified as discontinued operations brought in net cash proceeds 25 Table of Contents of $583.0 million in 2004 and included sale of most of the Companys conventional oil and gas properties in western Canada. During 2006, the Company borrowed $237.7 million under notes payable primarily to fund a portion of the Companys development capital expenditures. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans, including certain income tax benefits on stock options classified as financing activities, amounted to $36.6 million in 2006, $26.5 million in 2005 and $3.2 million in 2004. Maturity of U.S. government securities provided cash of $17.9 million in 2005. Property additions and dry hole costs used cash of $1,191.7 million in 2006, $1,246.2 million in 2005 and $938.4 million in 2004. Lower amounts used in 2006 compared to 2005 were mostly attributable to acquisition in 2005 of 68 retail fueling stations in the U.K. marketing operations. For E&P operations, higher costs in 2006 for development drilling at the Kikeh field in Block K Malaysia and exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico were mostly offset by lower costs in the year for Syncrude expansion and exploration drilling in the Republic of Congo. The increase in spending in 2005 versus 2004 was mainly caused by development activities at the Kikeh field offshore Sabah, Malaysia, and acquisition of the U.K. retail fueling stations. Cash used in other investing activities of $10.8 million in 2006 and $9.9 million in 2005 primarily related to advances under future equipment rental agreements in Malaysia. The Company repaid debt of $50.6 million in 2005 using a combination of internal cash flow and proceeds from sale of assets. Total paydown of debt was $495 million in 2004 and was mostly accomplished using a portion of the proceeds of asset dispositions classified as discontinued operations. Cash of $17.9 million was invested in 2004 in U.S. government securities with maturities greater than 90 days. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $98.2 million in 2006, $83.2 million in 2005 and $78.2 million in 2004. The Company raised its annualized dividend rate from $0.45 per share to $0.60 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2006. The Company had previously increased the annualized dividend rate from $0.40 per share to $0.45 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2004. Financial Condition Year end working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) totaled $796.0 million in 2006, $551.9 million in 2005 and $424.4 million in 2004. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying value for inventories under last in first out accounting was $389.5 million below fair value at December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2006 totaled $543.4 million compared to $585.3 million at year end 2005 and $535.5 million at year end 2004. The long term portion of debt increased by $230.7 million during 2006 and totaled $840.3 million at year end 2006, which represented 17.2% of total capital employed. The increase in long term debt in 2006 was necessitated by the Companys funding of significant ongoing oil and natural gas development projects, with the largest of these being the Kikeh field in Malaysia. Long term debt included $7.1 million of nonrecourse debt borrowed in connection with the Hibernia oil field development all of which is scheduled to be repaid by 2009. Long term debt was reduced by $3.8 million in 2005 as the Company utilized internal cash flow generated by operations to fund its capital program. Stockholders equity was $4.05 billion at the end of 2006 compared to $3.46 billion a year ago and $2.65 billion at the end of 2004. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 6 of this Form 10 K report. Other significant changes in Murphys year end 2006 balance sheet compared to 2005 included a $129.9 million increase in accounts receivable, which was caused by higher sales volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products at higher average prices near the end of 2006 compared to 2005, and higher amounts recoverable from insurance companies at year end 2006, which are mostly related to hurricane related repair costs at the Meraux refinery. Inventory values were $96.1 million higher at year end 2006 than in 2005 mostly because of more refined product volumes held in storage at the Meraux refinery and retail fueling stations, and more drilling equipment held in inventory in Malaysia. Prepaid expenses increased $103.4 million primarily due to higher prepaid costs on property insurance policies and higher prepaid Canadian income taxes. Short term deferred income tax assets decreased $19.4 million at year end 2006 due mostly to changes in the components of temporary differences in the U.S. and U.K. Net property, plant and equipment increased by $732.1 million in 2006 as property additions during the year were larger than the additional depreciation and amortization expensed. Deferred charges and other assets increased $77.2 million in 2006 due to both additional prepayments on future asset rentals for the Kikeh field in Malaysia and the higher noncurrent portion of amounts expected to be recoverable from insurance companies related mostly to repairs at the Meraux refinery. Current maturities of long term debt were not materially different at year end 2006 compared to 2005. Notes payable increased $2.7 million in 2006 due to short term borrowings by one of the Companys consolidated subsidiaries. Accounts payable rose by $21.4 million at year end 2006 compared to 2005 mostly due to amounts owed for the oil spill class action settlement agreement at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery, partially offset by lower amounts owed for crude oil purchases and capital expenditures. Income taxes payable decreased $42.9 million at year end 2006 due to higher tax installments paid relative to taxes accrued in the current year. Other taxes payable increased $37.7 million mostly due to higher sales, use and excise taxes 26 Table of Contents owed at year end 2006 compared to 2005. Deferred income tax liabilities decreased $32.2 million in 2006 due mostly to Canadian tax rate reductions enacted during the year. The liability associated with asset retirements increased by $61.1 million mostly due to development wells drilled during 2006 offshore Malaysia and in the Gulf of Mexico. Accrued major repair costs increased by $15.9 million primarily based on recording additional costs for future turnarounds of the Companys three refineries, which exceeded the turnaround amounts expended in 2006 that were charged against this liability. Deferred credits and other liabilities at the end of 2006 were $162.6 million higher than 2005 primarily due to the recording at year end 2006 of liabilities for underfunded retirement plans and an educational assistance contribution commitment. Minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary at the end of 2006 of $23.3 million related to the 20% of Berkana Energy Corp. that the Company does not own. The Company acquired 80% of Berkana Energy Corp. in December 2006 in exchange for a non cash contribution of the Companys Rimbey property in Alberta. Murphy had commitments for future capital projects of $922.6 million at December 31, 2006, including $105.9 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, $555.2 million for field development and future work commitments in Malaysia, $69.5 million for exploration drilling in the Republic of Congo and $18.1 million for future work commitments on the Scotian Shelf offshore eastern Canada. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, and maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2006, the Company had access to long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of $1.04 billion. No amounts were borrowed under these revolving credit facilities at year end 2006. These credit facilities were renewed for one additional year and were increased slightly in mid 2006. The most restrictive covenants under these existing credit facilities limit the Companys long term debt to capital ratio (as defined in the agreements) to 60%. At December 31, 2006, the long term debt to capital ratio was approximately 17.2%. At December 31, 2006, the Company had borrowed $235.0 million under uncommitted credit lines and had additional uncommitted amounts available of approximately US $771.0 million in a combination of U.S. and Canadian dollars. In addition, the Company has a shelf registration on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of up to $650 million in debt and or equity securities. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note E to the consolidated financial statements. Based on its 2007 Budget, the Company anticipates utilizing most of its long term borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities during the year to fund certain ongoing development projects including the Kikeh field in Malaysia. Such borrowing amounts are subject to change based on actual levels of cash flows and capital spending. At February 28, 2007, the Companys long term debt rating by Standard & Poors was BBB and by Moodys Investors Service was Baa2. The Company has a rating of A (low) from Dominion Bond Rating Service. In February 2007, Moodys stated that it is reviewing the Companys debt rating for a possible future downgrade. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 15.9 to 1 in 2006, 24.7 to 1 in 2005 and 13.4 to 1 in 2004. Environmental Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the Companys operations are: The U.S. Clean Air Act, which regulates air emissions The U.S. Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges into U.S. waters The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes The U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells Regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations These laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of water discharges. They also generally require permits for new or modified operations. Many states and foreign countries where Murphy operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water, which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements. Murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills. 27 Table of Contents CERCLA, commonly referred to as the Superfund Act and comparable state statutes, primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites. As discussed below, Murphy is involved in a limited number of Superfund sites. CERCLA also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous. RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owners property. Under OPA90, owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels, primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline, which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used. Several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels. The EPAs mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline are effective in 2008 and both of the Companys U.S. refineries have been expanded and are now capable of producing the required low sulfur gasoline. Each of the U.S. refineries must begin to produce the EPA required ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) beginning in 2010. The Meraux refinery is currently capable of producing this ULSD for approximately half of its diesel production, but the Superior refinery is not yet capable of meeting the ULSD standard. The Companys management is currently studying alternatives available for fully meeting this ULSD standard at Meraux and Superior. World leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. As part of these discussions, a Kyoto agreement was adopted in 1997 that has been ratified by certain countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future, with the United States being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement. The U.S. may ratify all or a portion of the agreement in the future. The agreement became effective for ratifying countries in early 2005 and these countries are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents. The Company is unable to predict how final regulations associated with the agreement will impact its costs in future years, but it is reasonable to expect these regulations to increase its compliance costs to some degree. The Company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the Companys operations. The Company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities, including three refineries, five terminals, and approximately 70 service stations, for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist. In addition the Company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation. Under the Companys accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. The Companys liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites. Although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes, the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount. The EPA currently considers the Company to be a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at two Superfund sites. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial. Based on currently available information, the Company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at both Superfund sites. The Company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on Superfund sites. The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other Superfund sites. The Company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to clean up the two Superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on its net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. There is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites, and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites. However, based on information currently available to the Company, the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. 28 Table of Contents Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the Company from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at December 31, 2006. The Companys refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories: spent catalysts (usually hydrotreating catalysts); spent/used filter media; tank bottoms and API separator sludge; contaminated soils; laboratory and maintenance spent solvents; and various industrial debris. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to $2.3 million in 2006. In addition to these expenses, Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Such capital expenditures were approximately $41.7 million in 2006 and are projected to be $58.9 million in 2007. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Because crude oil and natural gas sales prices have generally strengthened during the last several years, prices for oil field goods and services have risen (with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant), and prices could continue to be adversely affected in the future. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services, although the Company anticipates continued escalation in prices for certain equipment and services as long as oil prices remain strong. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of SFAS Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132R. This statement requires the Company to recognize in its consolidated balance sheet the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This statement also requires that the Company measure the funded status of a plan as of December 31 rather than September 30 as previously permitted. The Company implemented this statement for the year ended December 31, 2006, except for the transition to a year end measurement date which will occur in 2007. Refer to Note J for further information. In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on the SECs views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 was effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, with early application for the first interim period ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard at December 31, 2006 had no impact on its financial statements. In June 2006, the EITF finalized Issue 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement. The Task Force reached a consensus that this EITF applied to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. The EITF concluded that the presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue may be either gross (included in revenues and costs) or net (excluded from revenues and costs) and is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed by the Company. Excise taxes collected on sales of refined products and remitted to governmental agencies are not included in revenues or in costs and expenses. SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, was issued by the FASB in November 2004. This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges, and it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the related production facilities. This statement was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2006 and it did not have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. 29 Table of Contents In September 2005, the EITF decided in Issue 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty, that two or more exchange transactions involving inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined for purposes of evaluating the effect of APB Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. Additionally, the EITF decided that a nonmonetary exchange where an entity transfers finished goods inventory in exchange for the receipt of raw materials or work in progress inventory within the same line of business should generally be recognized by the entity at fair value. This consensus was applied to new arrangements entered into beginning April 1, 2006 and was applied to all inventory transactions that were completed after December 15, 2006 for arrangements entered into prior to March 15, 2006. The adoption of this consensus in 2006 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements. In March 2005, the EITF decided in Issue 04 6 that mining operations should account for post production stripping costs as a variable production cost that should be considered a component of mineral inventory costs. The Companys synthetic oil operation at Syncrude is affected by this ruling, which was effective as of January 1, 2006 for the Company. The Company has determined that the level of bitumen inventory at Syncrude affected by this EITF consensus is immaterial and it has continued to expense post production stripping costs as incurred. In September 2006, the FASB issued FSP AUG AIR 1 which prohibits, effective January 1, 2007, the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities as historically used by the Company. Accordingly, the Company will elect to use the deferral method for accounting for planned major maintenance activities beginning in 2007. Under the deferral method, the actual cost of each planned major maintenance activity is deferred and amortized through the next turnaround. Upon adoption in 2007 the Accrued Major Repair Costs reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets will be replaced by a non current asset representing the net unamortized major maintenance cost at the end of each reporting period and this accounting change is expected to cause a one time increase to retained earnings of the Company. All prior periods financial statements presented will be retrospectively restated upon adoption of this new standard. The Company is currently evaluating this FSP and has estimated the one time after tax credit to retained earnings to be approximately $70 million. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and requires additional financial statement disclosures about uncertain tax positions. The interpretation is effective beginning January 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating this interpretation and does not expect a significant impact on its financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and where applicable simplifies and codifies related guidance within GAAP and does not require any new fair value measurements. The Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2008. Provisions of the Statement are to be applied prospectively except in limited situations. The Company does not expect the initial adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on its financial statements. Other Murphy holds a 20% interest in Block 16 Ecuador, where the Company and its partners produce oil for export. In 2001, the local tax authorities announced that Value Added Taxes (VAT) paid on goods and services related to Block 16 and many oil fields held by other companies will no longer be reimbursed. In response to this announcement, oil producers filed actions in the Ecuador Tax Court seeking determination that the VAT in question is reimbursable. In July 2004, international arbitrators ruled that VAT was recoverable by another oil company, but the State of Ecuador responded that it was not bound by this arbitral decision. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a receivable of approximately $20.5 million related to VAT. In early 2007, Ecuadorian authorities settled this issue with the Company by agreeing to assign a portion of the governments future oil volumes to the Block 16 partners. The settlement had no material impact on the Companys financial position or net income. Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies are described below. 30 Table of Contents Proved oil and natural gas reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require that year end oil and natural gas prices must be used for determining proved reserve quantities. Year end prices usually do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Companys depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. The Companys proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages F 35 and F 36 of the 2006 annual report. The oil reserve revisions in 2006 in the U.S., Canada and Ecuador were based on performance of various local wells. The reserve revision in Malaysia in 2006 was mostly due to extension of proved oil in the Kikeh reservoir. The U.S. oil reserve revision in 2005 was mostly due to poor well performance at the deepwater Front Runner field. Oil reserve revisions in 2005 in Canada, the U.K. and Ecuador were due to better field performance, while the Malaysia revision was caused by higher oil prices that reduce volumes allocable to the Company for cost recovery under production sharing contracts. The reserve revision for U.S. oil in 2004 related primarily to loss of royalty relief for the Medusa and Front Runner deepwater fields based on year end 2004 oil prices. Oil reserve revisions in Canada in 2004 related to a combination of low heavy oil prices at year end that restricted economic recoverability of certain heavy oil reserves and higher projected royalties at the Terra Nova and Hibernia fields. Oil reserve revisions in Ecuador in 2004 were caused by a higher than previously estimated water cut in the liquid stream produced at Block 16. Downward revisions to U.S. natural gas reserves in 2006 were mostly caused by unfavorable production performance for gas wells at various fields in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore south Louisiana. The significant upward revision of natural gas reserves in Malaysia in 2006 related to gas associated with the Kikeh field that will be sold to the local government beginning in 2008. Natural gas reserve revisions were positive in the U.S. in 2004 due to better well performance. The Company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs, all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. In some cases, a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves can not be made immediately. This is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon(s) found. The determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is, in turn, usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves. Under current accounting rules, the Company holds well costs in Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Costs for one exploration well in progress at year end 2006 amounted to $3.2 million. Through February 2007, the well was determined to have successfully found hydrocarbon deposits and will be further evaluated for commerciality. Other wells in progress at year end were insignificant. Based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked, dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred. Dry hole expenses related to prior year well costs were $3.4 million in 2006 and $13.2 million in 2004; there were no dry holes in 2005 that were drilled in prior years. 31 Table of Contents Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital and abandonment costs, future margins on refined products produced and sold, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable reserve revisions, expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a propertys carrying value for possible impairment. In making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment, the Company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices, future production volumes, and future capital and operating costs. Due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the Companys projections. Estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available. The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. In assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets, the Company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events, which include projections of future margins, future capital expenditures and future operating expenses. Future marketing or operating decisions, such as closing or selling certain assets, and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the Companys conclusion about potential asset impairment. Although the Company does not believe it had any significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at December 31, 2006, one or a combination of factors such as significantly lower future sales prices, significantly lower future production, significantly higher future costs, or significantly lower future margins on refining and marketing sales could lead to impairment expenses in future periods. Based on these unknown future factors as described herein, the Company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to property basis differences and liabilities for future repairs, dismantlements and retirement benefits. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for Blocks H, PM 311/312, P, L and M in Malaysia, exploration licenses in the Republic of Congo and certain basis differences in the U.K. due to managements belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care 32 Table of Contents cost trend rate. Discount rates are adjusted as necessary, generally based on changes in AA rated corporate bond rates. Expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs. Based on higher bond yields during 2006, the Company has increased the primary plans discount rate from 5.70% in 2006 to 6.00% in 2007 and beyond. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 7.00% for the primary plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset returns. The Companys normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are estimated to increase slightly in 2007 compared to 2006 as the effects from a growing employee base will not fully offset the effects of a higher discount rate. In 2006, the Company paid $7.7 million into various retirement plans and $4.4 million into postretirement plans. In 2007, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $7.1 million into various retirement plans and $4.3 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed 7.0%, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected. As described above, the Companys retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5% decline in the discount rate would increase 2007 annual retirement and postretirement expenses by $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2007 retirement expense by $1.1 million. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company. Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments, and other long term liabilities. In addition, the Company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period. Total payments due after 2006 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below. Amount of Obligation (Millions of dollars) Total 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Total debt including current maturities $ 844.7 4.5 7.1 235.0 598.1 Operating leases 611.6 46.6 130.9 72.8 361.3 Purchase obligations 1,515.3 886.8 445.0 59.1 124.4 Other long term liabilities 391.6 21.3 70.8 30.8 268.7 Total $ 3,363.2 959.2 653.8 397.7 1,352.5 A floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel is currently being built by other companies and it is anticipated to be used in producing the Kikeh field in Block K Malaysia, which is scheduled to start up production in the second half of 2007. The Company will lease this FPSO subject to satisfactory completion of construction by its owners. Certain amounts to be paid after 2006 by the Company prior to completion of the FPSO construction period totaling $6.0 million have been included in the contractual obligation table above in 2007. If the FPSO is accepted by the Company in 2007, future undiscounted lease commitments will amount to $631 million; these amounts have not been included in the contractual obligation table above pending successful construction of the FPSO. Accounting treatment for this lease will be determined upon satisfactory delivery of the FPSO. In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement, subject to successful completion of construction, to lease a production facility for the Thunder Hawk field in Mississippi Canyon Block 734. No amounts are payable by the Company prior to the successful completion of construction of this facility. 33 Table of Contents In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amount of commitments as of December 31, 2006 that expire in future periods is shown below. Amount of Commitment (Millions of dollars) Total 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Financial guarantees $ 8.5 2.6 5.9 Letters of credit 176.9 155.1 21.8 Total $ 185.4 155.1 24.4 5.9 Material off balance sheet arrangements The Company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes. The most significant of these arrangements at year end 2006 involves an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract. The processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the Medusa field in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the contract, the Company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility. If actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through 2009 is less than a specified quantity, the Company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time. Through 2006, actual production from the Medusa field has exceeded the contractual minimum volumes. The Company has a contract to purchase hydrogen for the Meraux refinery through 2019. The contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased. Payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid. Future required minimum annual payments under both of these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown on the previous page. Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. A strong global economy, which fueled demand for oil and natural gas, led to strong prices for these products during 2005 and 2006. Due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil and North American natural gas prices, routine monitoring of spending plans is required. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2007 was prepared during the fall of 2006 and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to increase over 2006. Capital expenditures in 2007 are projected to total $1.9 billion. Of this amount, $1.6 billion or about 83%, is allocated for the exploration and production program. Geographically, E&P capital is spread approximately as follows: 17% for the United States, 56% for Malaysia, 12% for Canada and 15% for all other areas. Spending in the U.S. is primarily associated with continued development of producing deepwater fields and the Thunder Hawk field, which is anticipated to start up in mid 2009, as well as for the Companys Gulf of Mexico exploration program. In Malaysia, the majority of the spending is for continued development of the Kikeh field in Block K, where first oil is anticipated in the second half of 2007, and for development of natural gas fields in Blocks SK 309 and 311 offshore Sarawak where first production is anticipated in the first half of 2009. Spending in the Republic of Congo includes early development costs for the Azurite Marine discovery offshore. Refining and marketing expenditures in 2007 should be about $329 million of which almost 90% is allocated for the U.S. budget, which includes funds for construction of additional retail gasoline stations at Wal Mart Supercenters and other locations and real estate acquisitions near the Meraux refinery as part of the settlement of the oil spill litigation. Capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during 2007. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases, which often are not anticipated at the time the Budget is prepared. The Company currently expects to fund certain development costs in 2007, primarily in Malaysia at the Kikeh field in Block K and the gas fields in Sarawak, using available credit facilities. Most other funding is anticipated to be generated from operating cash flow. The Company forecasts an increase in long term debt of approximately $800 million in 2007. This forecast could change based on actual cash flow generated from operations and actual levels of capital spending. For example, a significant reduction in sales prices for crude oil and natural gas, without a corresponding decrease in capital spending, could cause the Companys long term debt to rise by more than the current forecast. In early 2007, oil prices weakened compared to prices experienced throughout most of 2006. These oil prices, in addition to gas prices, remained close to or above the prices used in the Companys 2007 budget. Through early 2007, margins for the Companys refining and marketing operations were below amounts included in the Companys 2007 budget. 34 Table of Contents The Company currently expects production in 2007 to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A key assumption in projecting the level of 2007 Company production is the anticipated start up of oil production at the Kikeh field in Malaysia in the last half of 2007. The Kikeh field will ramp up production throughout 2008. In addition, continued reliability of facilities at significant non operated fields such as Syncrude, Hibernia and Terra Nova are necessary to achieve the anticipated 2007 production levels.
