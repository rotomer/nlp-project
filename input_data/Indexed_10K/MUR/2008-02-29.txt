Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in the United States and United Kingdom. A more detailed description of the Companys significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy generates revenue primarily by selling oil and natural gas production and refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and other countries. The Companys revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells. Also, because crude oil is purchased by the Company for refinery feedstocks, natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields, and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the U.S. that are primarily located at Wal Mart Supercenters, the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the Companys costs. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration. Profits and generation of cash in the Companys refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins, which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing, transporting and marketing these products. Murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions. Worldwide oil prices were higher in 2007 than in 2006, while the average price for North American natural gas was up only slightly in 2007 compared to 2006. The average price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in 2007 was $72.25, an increase of 9% compared to 2006. The NYMEX natural gas price in 2007 averaged $7.11 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU), up 1% from 2006. Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company, especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately 90% of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis by the Company in 2007. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in 2008 or beyond, the Company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business. Such lower oil and gas prices could, but may not, have a favorable impact on the Companys refining and marketing operating profits. Results of Operations The Company had net income in 2007 of $766.5 million, $4.01 per diluted share, compared to net income in 2006 of $644.7 million, $3.41 per diluted share. In 2005 the Companys net income was $854.7 million, $4.55 per diluted share. The net income improvement in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily related to higher earnings generated by both the exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses. The net cost of corporate activities was higher, however, in 2007 than in 2006. The lower net income in 2006 compared to 2005 was caused by a combination of lower earnings in the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing operations and higher net costs for corporate activities. Further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections. Income from continuing operations was $766.5 million, $4.01 per diluted share, in 2007, $644.7 million, $3.41 per diluted share, in 2006, and $846.1 million, $4.50 per diluted share, in 2005. Income from discontinued operations was $8.6 million, $0.05 per diluted share, in 2005. There were no results from discontinued operations in 2007 and 2006. In the second quarter 2004 the Company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas properties in western Canada for cash proceeds of $583 million, which generated an after tax gain on the sale of $171.1 million in 2004. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 related to a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale of the western Canada properties in 2004. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the favorable tax adjustment associated with the sale in 2005 has been presented as Discontinued Operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. As explained in Note P to the consolidated financial statements, net income in 2006 and all prior years have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of FSP AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, in 2007. Consequently, net income in 2006 and 2005 as presented above increased by $6.4 million ($.04 per diluted share) and $8.2 million ($.04 per diluted share), respectively, from the amounts previously reported. 2007 vs. 2006 Net income in 2007 was $766.5 million, $4.01 per diluted share, compared to $644.7 million, $3.41 per diluted share, in 2006. The improvement in consolidated net income in 2007 of $121.8 million compared to 2006 was primarily related to higher earnings in both major businesses exploration and production ( E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M or downstream). The net costs of corporate activities were higher in 2007 and partially offset the improved results in E&P and R&M. Earnings in the E&P business improved by $40.3 million in 2007 as this business benefited from higher oil sales prices, lower exploration expenses and lower income taxes in 2007 compared to 2006. E&P earnings were adversely affected in 2007 by lower sales volumes for oil and natural gas and slightly lower realized natural gas sales prices as well as higher expenses for production, depreciation, depletion and administration. The R&M business generated record company profits in 2007, increasing $95.1 million compared to 2006. The improvement was primarily due to stronger U.S. refining margins in 2007 compared to 14 Table of Contents 2006, a fully operational refinery at Meraux, Louisiana, during 2007, and lower hurricane repair expenses in 2007, but R&M earnings in 2007 included an unfavorable impact from noncash inventory revaluations. The Meraux refinery was shut down for repairs for the first five months of 2006 following significant damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in late August 2005. The Company incurred significant repair costs in 2006 at Meraux following Hurricane Katrina, certain of which were not recoverable through insurance policies. In the U.K., the Company acquired the remaining 70% interest in the Milford Haven, Wales, refinery in late 2007. Under the Companys last in first out accounting policy for inventory, an after tax noncash charge of $59.5 million was recorded in 2007 to reduce the carrying value of crude oil and refined products inventory to beginning of year prices, which were significantly lower than at the end of the year. The net costs of corporate activities increased by $13.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006, with the cost increase mostly attributable to higher net interest expense and higher losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The higher net interest expense was caused by higher average borrowing levels, partially offset by a higher level of interest costs capitalized to E&P development projects. The U.S. dollar generally weakened against other significant foreign currencies used in the Companys business in 2007, especially compared to the Canadian dollar. The 2007 period included lower corporate administrative costs mostly due to higher expense in 2006 for an educational assistance contribution commitment. Sales and other operating revenues were $4.1 billion higher in 2007 than in 2006 mostly due to higher sales volumes and sales prices for gasoline and other refined products, higher sales prices for crude oil produced by the Company, and higher sales volumes for merchandise at retail gasoline stations. Sales volumes for oil and natural gas were lower in 2007 than in 2006. Gain/loss on sales of assets in 2007 was $9.8 million unfavorable to 2006 as the Company had no major asset sales in 2007. Interest and other income was lower by $3.0 million in 2007 due mostly to higher losses on foreign currency exchange attributable to a continued weakening of the U.S. dollar against the primary foreign currencies affecting the Companys operations, which include the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Malaysian ringgit. Crude oil and product purchases expense increased by $3.7 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a combination of higher purchase prices and throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks at the Companys refineries, higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations, and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at the gasoline stations. The higher crude oil purchase volumes in 2007 were caused by the Meraux refinery being operational throughout 2007 following about five months of downtime in 2006 for hurricane related repairs. Operating expenses increased by $218.8 million in 2007 compared to 2006 and included higher refinery and retail station costs, higher workover and repair costs for Gulf of Mexico oil and gas fields, and higher costs for oil and gas field operations in Malaysia, the U.K. and Ecuador and for synthetic oil operations at Syncrude. Exploration expenses were $16.2 million lower in 2007 than in 2006 primarily associated with less dry hole and geophysical expenses in Malaysia, but partially offset by higher costs in Canada for dry holes, geophysical, lease amortization and settlement of two work commitments on the Scotian Shelf. Selling and general expenses were $0.8 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 as higher compensation, insurance and Berkana Energy administrative costs in the just completed year were almost offset by lower costs associated with an educational assistance program called the El Dorado Promise. The Company acquired 80% of Berkana Energy in December 2006, and subsequently sold this investment in January 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $105.8 million higher in 2007 compared to 2006 due mostly to higher barrel equivalent unit rates for depreciation for virtually all E&P segments and higher depreciation for the Meraux refinery and retail gasoline stations. Impairment of long lived assets of $40.7 million in 2007 primarily related to closing 55 underperforming gasoline stations in the U.S. and Canada. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by $5.3 million in 2007 mostly due to additional abandonment obligations incurred as additional Kikeh development wells were drilled during the year, and higher anticipated future abandonment costs on existing wells in the U.S. Net costs associated with hurricanes was lower in 2007 by $106.2 million mostly due to uninsured repair costs incurred in 2006 at the Meraux refinery following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The costs recorded in 2007 related to a downward adjustment for anticipated insurance recoveries at the Meraux refinery based on recently updated loss limits published by the Companys primary property insurer. Interest expense increased by $22.9 million in 2007 mostly associated with a higher average level of outstanding borrowings during the year compared to 2006. The amount of interest costs capitalized to property, plant and equipment increased by $6.8 million in 2007 due to higher levels of spending on E&P development projects in Malaysia, the U.S. and the Republic of Congo. Minority interest in operations of Berkana Energy in Canada was favorable $0.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Income tax expense was $77.0 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 and was mainly attributable to higher pretax income levels. The effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings rose from 37.9% in 2006 to 38.0% in 2007. The tax rate in both years was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state income taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceed the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because the ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years is uncertain. The tax rates in both years benefitted, however, from overall favorable effects of tax rate changes in foreign countries. 2006 vs. 2005 Net income in 2006 was $644.7 million, $3.41 per diluted share, compared to $854.7 million, $4.55 per diluted share, in 2005. Net income in 2005 included income from discontinued operations of $8.6 million, which was $0.05 per share. The $210.1 million decline in net income in 2006 was primarily due to lower earnings in both the Companys E&P and downstream businesses, plus higher net costs for corporate activities. The Companys E&P earnings declined by $133.2 million in 2006 due to several factors, including an after tax gain of $104.5 million in 2005 related to a sale of most mature oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico, plus in 2006, lower sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas caused by lower production levels for these products, lower natural gas sales prices in North America and higher production and administrative expenses. The 2006 E&P results were favorably impacted by higher crude oil sales prices, lower exploration expenses, lower hurricane related costs and higher income tax benefits due to various tax rate changes. Company wide, the net costs associated with hurricanes were $42.5 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005. Hurricane costs in the Companys R&M business were $59.8 million higher in 2006 due to more uninsured costs associated with repairs at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery, clean up of a crude oil spill that occurred at the refinery as a result of damages from Hurricane Katrina, and settlement of litigation associated 15 Table of Contents with the oil spill. Hurricane costs in the Companys E&P business were lower in 2006 by $16.9 million due to lower costs for equipment and facilities repair, discretionary employee assistance and hurricane related insurance. Earnings in the R&M business were $21.0 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005, with the earnings reduction primarily caused by the aforementioned higher hurricane related costs. Excluding the higher hurricane costs, U.S. downstream earnings improved in 2006 compared to 2005, while 2006 earnings for downstream operations in the U.K. were down $7.4 million from record levels in 2005. The Company continued to expand its retail gasoline station business by adding 123 sites in 2006, with virtually all such additions located at Wal Mart Supercenters. The net costs of corporate activities were $47.2 million higher in 2006 than 2005. These costs increased mostly due to an educational assistance contribution commitment amounting to $25.1 million after tax, plus the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange movements as the U.S. dollar weakened against most other major currencies used by the Companys operations, including the British pound sterling and Euro. In addition, corporate activity costs in 2006 were unfavorable because 2005 included income tax benefits of $9.7 million from settlement of U.S. income tax audits. Sales and other operating revenues in 2006 were $2.6 billion higher than in 2005 mostly due to higher sales volumes and sales prices in the latter year for refined petroleum products. In addition, merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations increased in 2006 and the sales price of crude oil was higher in 2006. Revenue was unfavorably affected in 2006 by lower sales volumes of crude oil and lower sales volumes and prices for natural gas. Gain on sale of assets before income taxes amounted to $9.4 million in 2006 compared to $175.1 million in 2005. The prior year included a pretax gain of $165.0 million related to the sale of oil and natural gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf. Interest and other income in 2006 was unfavorable to the prior year by $3.3 million due mostly to higher foreign exchange charges associated with the unfavorable effects of the U.S. dollar weakening against the British pound sterling and Euro. Crude oil and product purchases expense increased by $2.4 billion in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher prices for crude oil and other purchased refinery feedstocks, higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations, and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at these gasoline stations. These higher costs were partially offset by lower volumes of crude oil purchased for feedstock in 2006 because the Meraux refinery was off line for repairs for the first five months of the year. Operating expenses increased by $257.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher repairs and other production expenses in the Companys E&P operations, higher costs to operate retail gasoline stations primarily due to more stations in operation, and higher refinery operating costs mostly associated with increased labor costs at the Companys Meraux refinery. Exploration expenses were lower in 2006 compared to 2005 by $13.2 million primarily due to lower dry hole charges in the current year in the Republic of Congo, but partially offset by higher dry hole and seismic and geophysical costs in the U.S. Selling and general expenses increased $69.7 million in 2006 due to various factors during the year, including costs for an educational assistance contribution commitment, the costs of reorganizing the Companys U.S. E&P operations, higher costs for professional consultants, and the initial costs to expense the grant date fair value of stock options which began in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $12.8 million lower in 2006 than 2005 generally due to lower volumes of crude oil and natural gas sold by the Companys E&P business. Depreciation expense in the downstream business was higher in 2006 mostly due to the continued addition of retail gasoline stations in the U.S. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by $1.2 million in 2006 mostly due to higher asset retirement obligations for Malaysian operations associated with drilling development wells at the Kikeh field during the year. The reasons for higher costs associated with hurricanes in 2006 were included in the previous paragraph. Interest expense increased in 2006 by $5.2 million due to higher average borrowings under the Companys credit facilities. The amount of interest costs capitalized to development projects increased by $4.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher capitalized costs associated with the Kikeh field, offshore Sabah Malaysia, and a field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Income tax expense in 2006 was lower than in 2005 by $145.2 million due to lower pretax earnings in 2006 and net tax benefits in the year from changes in tax rates in various taxing jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings in 2006 was 37.9% and included a net benefit of $19.7 million from the reduction of Federal and provincial tax rates in Canada offset in part by an increase in the tax rate on oil operations in the U.K. The effective tax rate in 2005 was 38.9% of consolidated pretax earnings. The tax rate in both years was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceed the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because the ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years is uncertain. 16 Table of Contents Segment Results In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2007 are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Exploration and production United States $ 98.2 212.4 385.5 Canada 370.2 330.6 310.1 United Kingdom 47.6 60.7 79.9 Malaysia 148.2 (5.9) (4.7) Ecuador 28.5 38.4 38.1 Other (35.6) (19.4) (58.9) 657.1 616.8 750.0 Refining and marketing North America 230.4 77.5 91.1 United Kingdom (24.7) 33.1 40.5 205.7 110.6 131.6 Corporate and other (96.3) (82.7) (35.5) Income from continuing operations 766.5 644.7 846.1 Income from discontinued operations 8.6 Net income $ 766.5 644.7 854.7 Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production operations were $657.1 million in 2007, $616.8 million in 2006 and $750.0 million in 2005. E&P earnings improved in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average realized oil sales prices for the Companys production. In addition, exploration expenses were lower by $16.1 million in 2007. Both years were favorably affected by income tax benefits associated with tax rate reductions in foreign countries. The 2007 results were unfavorably impacted compared to 2006 by lower oil and natural gas sales volumes, lower realized natural gas sales prices in North America and higher expenses for production, depreciation, depletion, administration and accretion of discounted abandonment liabilities. Crude oil sales volumes in 2007 were 3% lower than in 2006, despite a 4% increase in crude oil production in 2007 compared to 2006. The lower sales volumes were caused by the timing of sale transactions as the Company had a larger inventory of unsold crude oil at year end 2007 compared to a year earlier. The 2007 increase in crude oil inventory, which is primarily at the Kikeh field in Malaysia, is expected to return to normal levels during 2008. During 2007, lower oil sales volumes in the U.S. and Ecuador were only partially offset by higher oil sales volumes in Malaysia and Canada. The lower sales volumes in the U.S. were due to field declines in the Gulf of Mexico, while lower sales volumes in Ecuador were caused by make up sales volumes in 2006 that related to a prior year. Higher oil sales volumes in Malaysia were mostly caused by start up of the significant Kikeh field, offshore Sabah, in August, partially offset by lower production at the West Patricia field, offshore Sarawak. Higher volumes in Canada were attributable to better production volumes at the Terra Nova field in the Jeanne dArc basin, offshore Newfoundland, which was shut in for repairs for about six months in 2006. Natural gas sales volumes were 19% lower in 2007 than 2006 and the reduction was mostly due to field declines for maturing fields in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore south Louisiana as well as lower natural gas production at U.K. North Sea fields. The Companys average realized oil sales price was 20% higher in 2007 than 2006, while the average North American natural gas sales price was 5% lower in 2007. The $133.2 million reduction in 2006 earnings compared to 2005 was mostly attributable to lower production of crude oil and natural gas, which led to lower sales volumes for these products. Lower natural gas sales prices and higher production and administrative expenses in 2006 and a $104.5 million after tax gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 also were factors that led to lower E&P earnings in 2006. E&P earnings in 2006 were favorably impacted by higher realized oil sales prices, lower exploration expenses, lower hurricane related expenses and income tax benefits associated with tax rate changes enacted during the year. Crude oil sales volumes were down in 2006 by 13% compared to 2005, while natural gas sales volumes were down by 17%. Oil sales volumes were lower in 2006 primarily due to lower production at maturing fields in the Gulf of Mexico, lower production at the Terra Nova field, offshore Newfoundland, due to the field being shut in for six months for major equipment repairs, and lower production at West Patricia, offshore Sarawak Malaysia, due to a lower volumetric sharing percentage allocable to the Company under the production sharing contract as the field matures. The decline in natural gas sales volumes in 2006 was attributable to both the mid 2005 sale of mature gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and lower production from gas fields onshore south Louisiana. The Companys average worldwide realized crude oil sales price increased 14% in 2006, while the average realized sales price for North American natural gas decreased 10%. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 38 and F 39 of this Form 10 K report. Average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 6 of the 2007 Annual Report. 17 Table of Contents A summary of oil and gas revenues, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2007 2006 2005 United States Oil and gas liquids $ 310.8 440.1 448.8 Natural gas 121.7 160.4 216.6 Canada Conventional oil and gas liquids 628.6 476.0 519.7 Natural gas 23.0 24.1 29.7 Synthetic oil 351.4 270.0 224.7 United Kingdom Oil and gas liquids 129.5 156.8 159.8 Natural gas 16.6 23.3 19.9 Malaysia crude oil 436.0 219.6 232.9 Ecuador crude oil 126.1 122.7 116.6 Total oil and gas revenues $ 2,143.7 1,893.0 1,968.7 The Companys crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production averaged 91,522 barrels per day in 2007, 87,817 barrels per day in 2006 and 101,349 barrels per day in 2005. In 2007, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquid production increased by 3,705 barrels per day, or 4%, primarily due to start up in August of the Kikeh field in Block K, offshore Sabah, Malaysia. This prolific field came on only five years after discovery. Kikeh produced 11,658 barrels of oil per day for the full year 2007 and almost 40,000 barrels per day in December 2007. This field will continue to ramp up production during 2008 as more wells are brought on production. Oil production also increased in 2007 at Terra Nova, offshore eastern Canada, at Syncrude in Alberta, and in Ecuador. Oil volumes declined in 2007 at most other areas, including the U.S. and at Hibernia, West Patricia, the U.K. North Sea and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Terra Nova produced throughout 2007 after being off line for major equipment repairs for six months in 2006. Total production at Terra Nova was 10,557 barrels per day in 2007 and 3,900 barrels per day in 2006. Syncrude production totaled 12,948 barrels per day in 2007 compared to 11,701 barrels per day in 2006. The 2007 production increase at Syncrude was mostly attributable to a third coker unit that started up during 2006. Oil production totaled 8,946 barrels per day at Block 16 in Ecuador, up 338 barrels per day due to a more significant development drilling campaign in 2007. Oil production declined in the U.S. from 21,112 barrels per day in 2006 to 12,989 barrels per day in 2007. The reduction was due to declines at various maturing fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Heavy oil production in the WCSB fell from 12,613 barrels per day in 2006 to 11,524 barrels per day in 2007, primarily due to a slower development drilling program for non operated fields in Alberta. Oil production at Hibernia, offshore Newfoundland, was 8,314 barrels per day in 2007 compared to 10,996 barrels per day in 2006. The Hibernia field is experiencing production decline. Oil production in the U.K. was down from 7,146 barrels per day in 2006 to 5,281 barrels per day in 2007, with the reduction caused by declining production at the Companys primary fields in the North Sea. The West Patricia field, offshore Sarawak Malaysia, had net production of 8,709 barrels per day in 2007 after production levels of 11,298 barrels per day in 2006. West Patricia is also experiencing declining production along with an increased government take under the production sharing contract. Production of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids was 13% lower in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to lower volumes produced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore eastern Canada. U.S. oil production of 21,112 barrels per day in 2006 was down by 18% from 2005 levels. The reduction in the U.S. related to lower volumes at deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico and oil volumes produced in 2005 from fields on the continental shelf that were sold in the middle of that year. U.S. oil production in 2006 was virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes, while 2005 volumes were adversely affected by downtime associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Terra Nova, offshore eastern Canada, was off production for about one half of 2006 for major equipment repairs. The floating production, storage and offloading vessel was taken to Europe for turnaround and production restarted in mid November 2006. Production at Terra Nova was 3,900 barrels per day in 2006, down 64% from 2005 levels. Production at Hibernia totaled 10,996 barrels per day, which was 10% below 2005, with the decline due primarily to more downtime for equipment reliability issues in 2006. Total heavy oil production in WCSB increased 7% in 2006 and totaled 12,613 barrels per day. This increase was attributable to an ongoing development drilling program during 2006 at the Seal field in Alberta. Light oil production in the WCSB fell 21% to 443 barrels per day in 2006 mostly due to less condensate produced at the Rimbey gas field in Alberta. Synthetic oil production at Syncrude increased 10% in 2006 and was 11,701 barrels per day. A third coker unit was started up during 2006, and the new unit permits a larger volume of bitumen to be processed at the plant. The new coker experienced various start up issues, but was operating near capacity at year end 2006. All oil production in Malaysia during 2006 came from the West Patricia and adjoining Congkak fields in Block SK 309 offshore Sarawak. Net oil production from Malaysia was 11,298 barrels per day in 2006, 16% lower than in 2005 as the production sharing contract allocates a smaller portion of gross production to the Companys account in both a higher price environment and as prior costs are recovered. Gross production volumes at the Malaysian fields fell only 5% in 2006. Oil production offshore the United Kingdom fell 11% to 7,146 barrels per day. The most significant U.K. decline in 2006 occurred at the Schiehallion field and was primarily caused by a fire at the facilities used by this field. Total net oil produced at Block 16 in Ecuador was 8,608 barrels per day in 18 Table of Contents 2006, a 9% increase from 2005 as a development drilling campaign continued in 2006. Oil sales volumes in Ecuador significantly exceeded production in 2006 due to selling 853,000 barrels of oil in settlement of a dispute with partners over 2004 oil production that was originally withheld from the Company. Worldwide sales of natural gas were 61.1 million cubic feet (MMCF) per day in 2007, 75.3 million in 2006 and 90.2 million in 2005. Natural gas sales in the United States fell 21% in 2007 and averaged 45.1 MMCF per day. The decline of 11.7 MMCF per day in 2007 was due to declines at various fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore South Louisiana. Natural gas sales volumes in 2007 increased 2% in Canada and averaged 9.9 MMCF per day. Natural gas sales volumes in the U.K. fell 31% in 2007 and averaged 6.0 MMCF per day. The lower U.K. gas sales volumes were attributable to lower gas volumes sold from two oil fields in the North Sea. Sales of natural gas in the United States were 56.8 MMCF per day in 2006, down 19% from 2005. The reduced U.S. natural gas sales volume in 2006 was attributable to a combination of lower volumes produced onshore south Louisiana due to field decline and no volumes produced in 2006 at Gulf of Mexico continental shelf fields that were sold in mid 2005. In the Gulf of Mexico, production at a new field that came onstream in 2006 served to essentially offset lower volumes at other deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. U.S. natural gas sales volumes in 2006 were virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes, while volumes in 2005 were adversely affected by downtime associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Natural gas sales volumes in Canada of 9.8 MMCF per day in 2006 were 6% lower than 2005, mostly caused by normal field decline in the Rimbey area. Natural gas sales volumes in the U.K. in 2006 were 8.7 MMCF per day, 8% lower than in 2005. The 2006 decline for natural gas sales volumes in the U.K. was wholly attributable to make up gas volumes sold in 2005 at an offshore field in order to balance under sold production in earlier years. Excluding the make up volumes in 2005, U.K. natural gas sales volumes in 2006 would have exceeded 2005 amounts. Worldwide crude oil sales prices have risen in each of the last two years due to the combination of a strong world economy, real and perceived instability in worldwide crude oil production levels, and effective production output controls by OPEC producers. The Companys average realized sales price across all of its oil production was $62.05 per barrel in 2007, up 20% from the 2006 average of $51.62 per barrel. In the U.S., the Company realized an average price of $65.57 per barrel, up 14% from 2006. The average sales price for heavy oil produced in Canada was $32.84 per barrel, 27% higher than in 2006. Hibernia and Terra Nova sales prices averaged $71.43 and $68.54 per barrel, respectively, during 2007, which were increases of 13% and 15%. Synthetic oil production sold for $74.35 per barrel, up 18% from a year earlier. U.K. oil prices increased 6% to $68.38 per barrel in 2007. In Malaysia, oil produced at the West Patricia field sold for 14% more in 2007 than in 2006, with an average of $59.05 for the just completed year. The Kikeh field came on stream in August 2007 and all sales from this field occurred in the stronger price environment during the fourth quarter 2007 at an average of $90.84 per barrel. The average realized sales price after revenue sharing with the Ecuadorian government for Block 16 oil was $36.47 per barrel, an increase of 8% from 2006. For most of the year, the government received a 50% share of realized sales prices that exceeded a benchmark price that escalates with the monthly U.S. Consumer Price Index. However, in mid October the government changed its share of such revenue from 50% to 99%. At year end 2007, the benchmark oil price for Block 16 was approximately $23.28 per barrel. The Company and its partners in Block 16 intend to initiate arbitration proceedings claiming that the government does not have the right under the contract to change this sharing arrangement. The Company realized an average per barrel sales price of $51.62 for crude oil and condensate in 2006, up 14% from the 2005 average of $45.25 per barrel. The average realized oil sales price in 2006 in the U.S. was up 21% at $57.30 per barrel. The average sales price of Canadian heavy oil was $25.87 per barrel, also a 21% increase compared to 2005. Realized average prices per barrel for Hibernia and Terra Nova oil sales in 2006 were $63.48 and $59.79, respectively, with each up about 20% from 2005 averages. Synthetic oil production was sold at $63.23 per barrel in 2006, up 9% from 2005 prices. The realized sales price for synthetic oil did not rise as much as other oil because of higher volumes of similar crudes available in the market for which demand did not keep pace with the growth. Average crude oil prices in Malaysia of $51.78 per barrel in 2006 were 12% higher than 2005, while U.K. prices in 2006 rose 22% to $64.30 per barrel. The average oil price realized in Ecuador of $33.79 per barrel rose only 4% from 2005 as the Ecuadorian government passed a revenue sharing law that became effective in April 2006, whereby the government received a revenue share of 50% for realized prices exceeding a benchmark price that escalates with the inflation rate. The Companys North American natural gas sale prices in 2007 and 2006 did not rise in tandem with higher crude oil prices. The Companys average realized North American natural gas sales prices fell 5% in 2007 to $7.19 per thousand cubic feet (MCF). In the U.K., the average 2007 natural gas price rose 3% to $7.54 per MCF. North American gas sales prices averaged $7.57 per MCF in 2006, down 10% from the 2005 average. The sales price for natural gas in the U.K. was up 27% and averaged $7.34 per MCF. Based on 2007 sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1.00 per barrel and $0.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by $19.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. 19 Table of Contents Production expenses were $463.0 million in 2007, $383.2 million in 2006 and $302.6 million in 2005. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 38 and F 39 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table. Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 10.75 7.10 5.17 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 8.77 9.36 4.40 Synthetic oil 30.56 28.23 24.35 United Kingdom 10.34 6.19 5.10 Malaysia 12.60 7.46 6.98 Ecuador 10.60 7.85 7.07 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 10.29 7.91 5.31 Production cost per equivalent barrel increased in the U.S. in 2007 mostly due to higher workover and field repairs and lower production volumes. The rate per equivalent barrel in 2006 was up from 2005 mostly due to higher insurance costs coupled with lower overall production. The per unit costs for Canadian conventional oil and gas operations, excluding Syncrude was lower in 2007 than 2006 primarily due to higher production levels and lower repair costs at Terra Nova in 2007. The field was shut in for major repairs for six months in 2006. Canadian costs excluding Syncrude rose significantly in 2006 due to lower production volumes and higher repair costs at Terra Nova while off line for major repairs, plus a higher mix of more costly heavy oil production versus lighter oils. Higher production costs per barrel for Canadian synthetic oil operations in 2007 were primarily due to a higher net profit royalty rate and a higher foreign exchange rate. In 2006 higher costs for synthetic operations were mostly attributable to higher coker repair costs and higher compensation costs. The higher average U.K. cost per barrel in 2007 was mostly due to higher maintenance costs, lower oil production at the North Sea fields and a higher foreign exchange rate. The higher per unit cost in Malaysia in 2007 was due to the start up phase for Kikeh oil and a lower production level for West Patricia. Higher 2006 costs per barrel produced in the U.K. and Malaysia were mostly attributable to higher facility maintenance costs. Higher per unit operating costs in Ecuador in 2007 were primarily caused by increasing water handling costs as Block 16 wells mature. Higher per unit operating costs in Ecuador in 2006 compared to 2005 were mostly attributable to higher field operating costs in the Amazon region where Block 16 is located. Exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 38 and F 39 on this Form 10 K report. Certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Dry holes $ 67.1 111.0 126.0 Geological and geophysical 67.7 73.1 73.4 Other 35.1 12.6 10.2 169.9 196.7 209.6 Undeveloped lease amortization 33.2 22.5 22.8 Total exploration expenses $ 203.1 219.2 232.4 Dry holes expense was $43.9 million less in 2007 than 2006 primarily due to a lower level of exploration drilling activity in 2007. With mostly new E&P management in 2007, much of the year was spent reevaluating exploration drilling prospects on a worldwide basis. Dry holes expense was $15.0 million lower in 2006 than 2005 mostly due to less unsuccessful wildcat drilling in the Republic of Congo, but partially offset by higher unsuccessful drilling costs in the Gulf of Mexico. Geological and geophysical (G&G) expenses were $5.4 million less in 2007 than 2006 primarily due to lower spending on 3 D seismic in Blocks SK 311 and H, and lower geophysical analyses on PM Blocks 311/312, all in Malaysia. The lower Malaysian costs were partially offset by higher seismic costs in 2007 in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Australia, and higher geophysical studies offshore the Republic of Congo. G&G expenses in 2006 were about level with 2005 as higher costs in the Gulf of Mexico were essentially offset by lower spending offshore eastern Canada. Other exploration expenses in 2007 were $22.5 million higher than 2006 mostly due to a $21.9 million settlement of unfulfilled work commitments on two expiring Scotian Shelf leases. Other exploration expenses in 2006 were $2.4 million higher than in 2005 mostly due to higher administrative costs for international exploration activities. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose $10.7 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to amortization of land acquisitions at the Tupper property in northeast British Columbia. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense in 2006 was virtually flat with 2005. A $2.6 million charge for asset impairment in 2007 was taken to write down an unused E&P administrative office to its estimated fair value. Costs of $1.9 million and $18.8 million were incurred in 2006 and 2005, respectively, in the Companys exploration and production operations for uninsured costs to repair damages and to recognize associated higher insurance costs caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. These costs were related to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and also included in 2005 discretionary assistance to employees in the New Orleans area after Hurricane Katrina. 20 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled $376.8 million in 2007, $297.0 million in 2006 and $319.1 million in 2005. The $79.8 million increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was caused by generally higher per unit rates for development capital, the start up of the Kikeh field, and an increase in foreign exchange rates in Canada and the U.K. The $22.1 million reduction in 2006 compared to 2005 was attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales volumes, partially offset by generally higher per barrel capital amortization caused by higher costs for development operations and negative U.S. reserve revisions. The Company continues to experience high drilling and related costs caused by a strong demand for such services. The exploration and production business recorded expenses of $16.1 million in 2007, $10.8 million in 2006 and $9.6 million in 2005 for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities. Because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment. The higher accretion costs in 2007 were mostly related to higher estimated future abandonment costs for facilities and wells in the Gulf of Mexico and future abandonment obligations related to additional development wells drilled in the Kikeh field in 2007. The higher accretion costs incurred in 2006 were also mostly associated with development wells drilled at the Kikeh field in the prior year. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was 34.6% in 2007, 36.1% in 2006 and 39.1% in 2005. Both 2007 and 2006 included net tax benefits due to enacted changes in foreign tax rates. Canada lowered federal tax rates in both years and in 2006 the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan also lowered tax rates. The net benefit from these Canadian tax rate reductions, which effectively reduced recorded deferred tax liabilities was $38.7 million in 2007 and $37.5 million in 2006. A U.K. tax rate increase from 40% to 50% on oil and gas profits in 2006 increased taxes in the prior year by $17.8 million. The effective tax rate in 2007 was slightly below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the enacted Canadian tax rate reduction during the year. The 2007 effective tax rate was lower than in 2006 mostly due to the charge in 2006 related to the U.K. tax rate increase. A benefit for a charitable building donation based on fair value reduced U.S. taxes by $4.4 million in 2007. Also in 2007, the Company incurred lower exploration and other expenses in tax jurisdictions where tax relief is currently not available. These tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include non revenue generating areas in Malaysia, the Republic of Congo and Indonesia. Each main exploration area in Malaysia is currently ring fenced and no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for Blocks H, P, L and M, offshore Sabah, and Blocks PM 311/312, offshore Peninsula Malaysia. Although the 2006 effective tax rate was only slightly higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, the annual rate was lower than in 2005 mostly due to net benefits from the aforementioned tax rate changes. The effective tax rate in 2005 was higher than the average U.S. statutory rate due to unrecognized income tax benefits on certain exploration and other expenses in Malaysia and the Republic of Congo. At December 31, 2007, approximately 39% of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 38% of the U.S. proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped. Virtually all of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves (on a barrel of oil equivalent basis) are associated with the Companys various deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. Further drilling, facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed. In Block K Malaysia, 42% of both oil and natural gas reserves of 61.2 million barrels and 107.1 billion cubic feet, respectively, at year end 2007 for the Kikeh field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and continued development drilling, and 100% of the 14.8 million barrels of oil reserves at the Kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of drilling operations directed by another company. Also in Malaysia, there were 317.0 billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore Sarawak at year end 2007, pending completion of development drilling and facilities. First gas production at the Kikeh field is scheduled for the second half of 2008 and at Sarawak fields in early 2009. On a worldwide basis, the Company spent approximately $769 million in 2007, $560 million in 2006 and $378 million in 2005 to develop proved reserves. The Company expects to spend about $1,061 million in 2008, $495 million in 2009 and $474 million in 2010 to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing (R&M) operations generated record earnings of $205.7 million in 2007, after earning $110.6 million in 2006 and $131.6 million in 2005. The 86% improvement in R&M earnings in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to stronger refining margins in the U.S., lower hurricane related expenses in 2007, and a fully operational Meraux refinery which was shut down for repairs for about five months in 2006 following Hurricane Katrina. Total hurricane expenses after taxes in R&M operations were $1.9 million in 2007, $67.1 million in 2006 and $28.7 million in 2005. The Meraux, Louisiana refinery significantly increased crude oil throughputs in 2007 compared to 2006, which was unfavorably affected by downtime for repairs. R&M earnings in 2007 were net of two significant charges a $24.5 million after tax charge related to closure of 55 gasoline stations in the U.S. and Canada, and an after tax inventory charge of $59.5 million in the U.K. The 16% decline in earnings in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to hurricane related after tax costs of $67.1 million and lower crude oil throughput volumes at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery. In late August 2005, the Meraux refinery experienced severe flooding and wind damage associated with Hurricane Katrina and was shut down from late August 2005 through mid 2006. The hurricane related costs in 2006 were partially offset by stronger refining margins generated by the Superior, Wisconsin refinery and continued growth in the Companys North American retail gasoline marketing activities. The Companys North American R&M operations generated earnings of $230.4 million in 2007, $77.5 million in 2006 and $91.1 million in 2005. North American operations include refining activities in the United States and marketing activities in the United States and Canada. The 2006 and 2005 operating results for the Companys North American refining business were negatively impacted by hurricane related costs and below optimal Meraux refinery crude throughput volumes as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Uninsured damages, higher insurance premiums, settlement of the class action oil spill litigation and other hurricane related pretax costs in the Companys North American operations were $3.0 million in 21 Table of Contents 2007, $107.3 million in 2006 and $46.3 million in 2005. The 2007 hurricane costs were caused by a downward adjustment of expected insurance recoveries based on the latest loss limits published by the Companys primary insurer. The Meraux refinery throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks averaged 112,840 barrels per day in 2007, 57,198 barrels per day in 2006 and 75,443 barrels per day in 2005. Significant flooding and wind damage associated with Hurricane Katrina resulted in the refinery being shut down from late August 2005 through May 2006. During the refinerys nine months of downtime for repairs, major upgrades and improvements were completed, and turnarounds on the refinerys hydrocracker and fluid catalytic cracking unit debutanizer were performed. The Companys refinery in Superior, Wisconsin generated strong earnings in 2007 and 2006 as a result of steady operations and the continued strength of industry refining margins in North America. The operating results for the Companys North American retail gasoline stations were lower in 2007 compared to the prior year as 55 underperforming stores were closed during the just completed year, including 47 in the U.S. and all eight stations in Canada. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $38.2 million in 2007 associated with these store closures. Excluding this impairment charge, the 2007 operating results for this business would have been essentially flat with 2006. A total of 33 new retail stations were opened in 2007, including 31 in the parking lots of Wal Mart Supercenters and two at other locations. Average fuel sales per station increased again in 2007, the 10th straight year of improvements. The Companys operating results in 2006 for North American retail operations were similar to 2005, and 2006 was highlighted by higher average fuel and non fuel sales volumes compared to 2005 as well as continued additions to the number of stations in operation. Retail fuel sales volumes increased 22% in 2006 compared to 2005. The Company added 123 Murphy USA fueling stations in 2006, a 14% increase in the number of sites at year end 2006 compared to 2005. Unit margins (sales realization less costs of crude and other feedstocks, transportation to point of sale and refinery operating and depreciation expenses) averaged $4.28 per barrel in North America in 2007, $3.48 in 2006 and $2.96 in 2005. North American refined product sales volumes increased 19% to a record 416,668 barrels per day in 2007, following a 9% increase to 350,601 barrels per day in 2006. The Companys U.S. retail gasoline stations continued to increase per site fuel sales volumes with a 4% increase in the average monthly fuel sales volume per station in 2007 following a 6% increase in 2006. Operations in the United Kingdom reported a loss of $24.7 million in 2007 compared to earnings of $33.1 million in 2006 and $40.5 million in 2005. On December 1, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 70% of the Milford Haven, Wales refinery that it did not already own. In association with this acquisition, the Company built a significant additional layer of crude oil and refined products inventory. The 2007 loss included a $59.5 million after tax non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of these higher inventory levels to early 2007 prices. Under the Companys last in first out (LIFO) inventory accounting policy, inventory volume increases are priced at the first purchase prices during the year, and the prices of crude and refined products were at a much lower level in early 2007 compared to the price at the time these products were acquired near year end 2007. After the LIFO charge, the average go forward carrying value for these additional inventories in the U.K. has been reduced by approximately $40 per barrel. Excluding this non cash inventory charge, the 2007 operating result for the Companys U.K. operations was slightly improved over 2006. The decrease in 2006 U.K. earnings compared to 2005 was due primarily to lower refinery margins as a result of higher operating and transportation costs in 2006 and nonrecurring credits in 2005 for property tax rebates and insurance settlements. The decline in refinery earnings in 2006 was partially offset by stronger marketing margins and higher marketing sales volumes as a result of the contribution from 68 retail sites acquired in 2005. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $0.22 per barrel in 2007, $6.39 per barrel in 2006 and $6.36 per barrel in 2005. Overall sales of refined products in the U.K. increased 19% in 2007, following a decline of 2% in 2006. The 2007 sales increase was mostly attributable to additional quantities of refined products produced after the Milford Haven acquisition. The decline in 2006 sales volumes was primarily due to lower demand for refined products based on higher average sales prices. Corporate The after tax costs of corporate activities, which include interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, were $96.3 million in 2007, $82.7 million in 2006 and $35.5 million in 2005. Net corporate costs increased $13.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to higher net interest expense and higher losses on foreign exchange. These higher costs were partially offset by lower costs in 2007 associated with an educational assistance commitment. Net interest expense rose by $16.1 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to interest associated with higher average outstanding long term debt balances. The Companys borrowings increased due to higher capital spending on oil and natural gas development projects in Malaysia, the Republic of Congo and Canada, and in the downstream business related to capital spending for the purchase of the Milford Haven, Wales refinery and land underlying most gasoline stations at Wal Mart sites. The amount of interest capitalized to development projects increased in 2007 in association with higher capital development spending. The after tax effect of foreign exchange was a charge of $13.8 million in 2007 compared to $7.9 million in 2006. The U.S. dollar weakened in 2007 by 17% against the Canadian dollar, 11% against the Euro and 2% against the British pound sterling. Administrative expenses in 2007 in the corporate area were $20.3 million less than 2006 due mostly to lower costs associated with the El Dorado Promise educational assistance contribution, but partially offset by higher compensation costs in the current year. The El Dorado Promise involves the Companys commitment to contribute $5.0 million per year through 2016 to pay for post secondary tuition for eligible graduates of El Dorado High School in Arkansas. Income taxes were unfavorable in the corporate area in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a higher portion of interest and administrative expenses allocable to foreign operations without current tax relief. Net corporate costs were $47.2 million higher in 2006 than 2005 primarily due to a $25.1 million after tax cost recorded in 2006 for the El Dorado Promise, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and lower income tax benefits in 2006. The U.S. dollar weakened by 14% against the British 22 Table of Contents pound sterling and 12% against the Euro during 2006, but the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar was not significantly different in 2006 compared to 2005. The after tax effect of the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 was a charge of $7.9 million, while the foreign exchange effect on 2005 was insignificant. The 2005 corporate results included $9.7 million of income tax benefits due to refund and settlement of prior year U.S. income tax matters. Interest income was higher by $4.9 million in 2006 mostly due to interest collected on favorable settlements of prior year lawsuits and other disagreements with partners on E&P projects in Ecuador and western Canada. Administrative expenses in the corporate area were $40.2 million higher in 2006 mostly due to the educational assistance commitment, plus higher costs associated with initial recognition of the grant date fair value of stock options beginning in 2006. These higher administrative expenses were partially offset in 2006 by lower other incentive compensation costs. Interest expense was $5.2 million higher in 2006 mostly due to higher average outstanding borrowings under credit facilities. The portion of interest capitalized to development projects increased by $4.5 million in 2006 due mostly to higher capital spending on Kikeh field development, offshore Sabah, Malaysia, and for field development in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by lower interest capitalized on the expansion at Syncrude. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 13 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures, including exploration expenditures, were $2,357.3 million in 2007 compared to $1,262.5 million in 2006 and $1,329.8 million in 2005. These amounts included $169.9 million, $196.7 million and $209.6 million, respectively, in 2007, 2006 and 2005 for exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled $1,780.7 million in 2007, $1,082.8 million in 2006 and $1,092.0 million in 2005, representing 76%, 86% and 82%, respectively, of the Companys total capital expenditures for these years. E&P capital expenditures in 2007 included $422.6 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, primarily in the Tupper area of northeastern British Columbia, $205.7 million for exploration activities, and $1,152.4 million for development projects. Development expenditures included $183.5 million for deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico; $512.2 million for the Kikeh field in Malaysia; $69.4 million for natural gas and other development activities in SK Blocks 309/311; $23.6 million for synthetic oil operations at the Syncrude project in Canada; $96.9 million for western Canada heavy oil and natural gas projects; $129.3 million for development of the Azurite field in the Republic of Congo; $26.5 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland; $31.2 million for fields in the U.K. North Sea; and $40.1 million for development of Block 16 in Ecuador. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 37 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled $572.5 million in 2007, $173.4 million in 2006 and $202.4 million in 2005. These amounts represented 24%, 14% and 15% of capital expenditures of the Company in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Refining capital spending was $330.0 million in 2007 compared to $57.3 million in 2006 and $34.1 million in 2005. The 2007 refining capital included $240.7 million for acquisition of the remaining 70% of the Milford Haven, Wales refinery. Most of the remaining refinery capital in 2007 was related to property acquired surrounding the Meraux, Louisiana refinery. The bulk of the refining capital in 2006 was spent at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery where numerous capital improvements were completed while the plant was shut down for repairs following Hurricane Katrina. Marketing expenditures amounted to $242.5 million in 2007, $116.1 million in 2006 and $168.2 million in 2005. The capital spending in 2007 was mostly attributable to acquisition of land underlying retail gasoline stations located at Wal Mart Supercenters. The majority of marketing expenditures in 2006 and 2005 was related to construction of retail gasoline stations at Wal Mart Supercenters in the U.S. The Company opened 33 new stations within this network in 2007, after adding 123 in 2006 and 112 in 2005. In 2005, the Company also purchased 68 retail fueling stations in the U.K., thereby expanding its company owned retail station count in that country by 70%. Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $1,740.4 million in 2007, $975.5 million in 2006 and $1,248.9 million in 2005. Cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was approximately $765 million more than in 2006 mostly due to a combination of higher net income, higher depreciation, impairment and deferred tax expenses, and a reduction of noncash operating working capital in 2007 versus an increase in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was about $273 million lower than in 2005 and was unfavorably affected by higher spending in 2006 for inventories, prepaid insurance, and repair costs at the Meraux refinery. In addition, 2006 cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably affected by lower oil and natural gas sales volumes and higher operating costs associated with repairs of oil and gas production facilities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2005 included $8.6 million from discontinued operations. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by expenditures for abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $13.0 million in 2007, $3.3 million in 2006 and $8.3 million in 2005. Cash proceeds from property sales were $21.6 million in 2007, $23.8 million in 2006 and $172.7 million in 2005. The sales proceeds in 2007 and 2006 primarily related to sales of various properties, real estate and aircraft. The 2005 sales proceeds were mostly attributable to sale of most oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico; the Company retained its deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties. During 2007 and 2006, the Company borrowed $686.2 million and $237.7 million, respectively, under notes payable primarily to fund a portion of the Companys development capital expenditures. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans, including certain income tax benefits on stock options classified as financing activities, amounted to $72.4 million in 2007, $36.6 million in 2006 and $26.5 million in 2005. Maturity of U.S. government securities provided cash of $17.9 million in 2005. 23 Table of Contents During 2007, the Company spent $348.3 million to acquire the remaining 70% interest in the Milford Haven, Wales refinery and associated inventory. Property additions and dry hole costs used cash of $1,949.2 million in 2007, $1,191.7 million in 2006 and $1,246.2 million in 2005. Higher amounts spent in 2007 mostly related to ongoing E&P development projects, including Kikeh, Azurite, Sarawak gas and one field in the Gulf of Mexico, acquisition of mineral rights in the Tupper area of western Canada, and purchases of land under gasoline stations at Wal Mart stores and surrounding the Meraux refinery. Lower amounts used in 2006 compared to 2005 were mostly attributable to acquisition in 2005 of 68 retail fueling stations by the U.K. marketing operations. For E&P operations, higher costs in 2006 for development drilling at the Kikeh field in Block K Malaysia and exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico were mostly offset by lower costs during the year for Syncrude expansion and exploration drilling in the Republic of Congo. Cash of $14.6 million in 2007, $12.8 million in 2006 and $23.7 million in 2005 was used to fund turnarounds of refineries and at Syncrude. A complete scheduled turnaround occurred at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery in 2005. The Company repaid debt of $50.6 million in 2005 using a combination of internal cash flow and proceeds from sale of assets. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $127.4 million in 2007, $98.2 million in 2006 and $83.2 million in 2005. The Company raised its annualized dividend rate from $0.60 per share to $0.75 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2007. The Company had previously increased the annualized dividend rate from $0.45 per share to $0.60 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2006. Financial Condition Year end working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) totaled $777.5 million in 2007, $796.0 million in 2006 and $551.9 million in 2005. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying value for inventories under last in first out accounting was $709.7 million below fair value at December 31, 2007. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2007 totaled $673.7 million compared to $543.4 million at year end 2006 and $585.3 million at year end 2005. The long term portion of debt increased by $675.9 million during 2007 and totaled $1,516.2 million at year end 2007, which represented 23.0% of total capital employed. The increase in long term debt in 2007 was necessitated by the Companys funding of significant ongoing oil and natural gas development projects, with the largest of these being the Kikeh field in Malaysia. Long term debt at year end 2007 included $3.1 million of nonrecourse debt associated with the Hibernia oil field development; all the nonrecourse debt is scheduled to be repaid by 2009. Long term debt increased by $230.7 million in 2006 as the Company utilized its borrowing capacity to fund its development capital program. Stockholders equity was $5.07 billion at the end of 2007 compared to $4.12 billion a year ago and $3.52 billion at the end of 2005. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 6 of this Form 10 K report. Other significant changes in Murphys year end 2007 balance sheet compared to 2006 included a $425.5 million increase in accounts receivable, which was caused by sales of crude oil and refined petroleum products at higher average prices near the end of 2007 compared to 2006. Inventory values were $215.6 million higher at year end 2007 than in 2006 mostly because of more crude oil and refined product volumes held in storage at the Milford Haven refinery following the purchase of the remaining 70% on December 1, 2007, plus a higher level of unsold crude oil production held in inventory caused mostly by timing of sales liftings at the Kikeh field. Prepaid expenses decreased $57.1 million in 2007 primarily due to lower prepaid Canadian income taxes. Short term deferred income tax assets increased $65.4 million at year end 2007 due mostly to changes in the components of temporary differences in the U.K. following the Milford Haven refinery acquisition. Net property, plant and equipment increased by $2,003.5 million in 2007 as a significant level of property additions during the year exceeded the additional depreciation and amortization expensed. Goodwill increased $7.4 million due to a stronger Canadian dollar exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. Deferred charges and other assets increased $262.1 million and deferred credits and other liabilities increased by $236.4 million in 2007 due to essentially offsetting recorded assets and liabilities associated with significant E&P development projects. Current maturities of long term debt were not materially different at year end 2007 compared to 2006. Notes payable increased $4.9 million in 2007 due to short term borrowings by the Companys consolidated subsidiary, Berkana Energy Corp. Accounts payable rose by $653.8 million at year end 2007 compared to 2006 mostly due to higher amounts owed for crude oil and refined product purchases and for capital expenditures. Income taxes payable increased $45.8 million at year end 2007 due to higher taxes owed in the current year on income in the U.S., Canada, Malaysia and the U.K. Other taxes payable increased $48.4 million mostly due to higher sales, use and excise taxes owed at year end 2007 compared to 2006. Other accrued liabilities increased by $44.6 million in 2007 mostly due to higher amounts payable into the Companys domestic retirement plans in 2008. Deferred income tax liabilities increased $295.6 million in 2007 due mostly to higher liabilities for future taxes in the U.K., U.S., Canada and Malaysia. The liability associated with future asset retirement obligations increased by $98.2 million mostly due to development wells drilled during 2007 offshore Malaysia and higher estimated future costs for abandonment of existing wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary at the end of 2007 of $26.9 million related to the 20% of Berkana Energy Corp. that the Company did not own. The Company acquired 80% of Berkana in December 2006 in exchange for a non cash contribution of the Companys Rimbey property in Alberta. The Company sold its entire investment in Berkana shares in January 2008. Murphy had commitments for future capital projects of approximately $2,129.0 million at December 31, 2007, including $84.0 million for lease acquisitions in a recent Gulf of Mexico sale, $71.4 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, $850.3 million for field development and future work commitments in Malaysia, $561.2 million for field development and a work commitment in the Republic of Congo, and $157.1 million for purchases of land underlying certain U.S. retail gasoline stations. A partial sale of the Companys working interest in the Republic of Congo was pending government approval at December 31, 2007. Once approved, the Companys commitment for field development will be reduced by approximately $178.0 million. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, and maintains lines of credit with banks 24 Table of Contents and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had access to long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of $1.962 billion. A total of $718.5 million was borrowed under these revolving credit facilities at year end 2007. These credit facilities increased significantly and were renewed for one additional year during 2007. The most restrictive covenants under these existing credit facilities limit the Companys long term debt to capital ratio (as defined in the agreements) to 60%. At December 31, 2007, the long term debt to capital ratio was approximately 23.0%. At December 31, 2007, the Company had borrowed $197 million under uncommitted credit lines and had additional uncommitted amounts available of approximately US $440 million in a combination of U.S. and Canadian dollars. In addition, the Company has a shelf registration on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that permits the offer and sale of up to $650 million in debt and or equity securities. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note F to the consolidated financial statements. Based on its 2008 Budget, the Company anticipates utilizing a significant portion of its long term borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities during the year to fund certain ongoing development projects. The level of additional borrowings are subject to change based on actual levels of cash flows and capital spending. At February 28, 2008, the Companys long term debt rating by Standard & Poors was BBB and by Moodys Investors Service was Baa3. The Company has a rating of A (low) from Dominion Bond Rating Service. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 14.5 to 1 in 2007, 16.1 to 1 in 2006 and 24.1 to 1 in 2005. Environmental Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the Companys operations are: The U.S. Clean Air Act, which regulates air emissions The U.S. Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges into U.S. waters The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes The U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells Regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations These laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of water discharges. They also generally require permits for new or modified operations. Many states and foreign countries where Murphy operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water, which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements. Murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills. CERCLA, commonly referred to as the Superfund Act, and comparable state statutes primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites. As discussed below, Murphy is involved in a limited number of Superfund sites. CERCLA also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous. RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes. Under OPA90, owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels, primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline, which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel is used. Several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels. The EPAs mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline are effective in 2008 and both of the Companys U.S. refineries have been expanded and are now capable of producing the required low sulfur gasoline. Each of the U.S. refineries must begin to produce the EPA required ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) beginning in 2010. The Meraux refinery is currently capable of producing this ULSD for approximately half of its diesel production, but the Superior refinery is not yet capable of meeting the ULSD standard. The Companys management is currently studying alternatives available for fully meeting this ULSD standard at Meraux and Superior. The Energy Independence and Security Act was signed into law in December 2007. The Act through EPA regulation requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production. This Act greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the Renewable Fuels Standard which began in September 2007. Murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to meet its obligation. World leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. As part of these discussions, the Kyoto agreement was adopted in 1997 that has been ratified by certain countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future, with the United States being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement. The U.S. may ratify all or a portion of the agreement in 25 Table of Contents the future. The agreement became effective for ratifying countries in 2005 and these countries have implemented regulations or are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents. The Company is unable to predict how final regulations associated with the agreement will impact its costs in future years, but it is reasonable to expect these regulations to increase its compliance costs to some degree. The Company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the Companys operations. The Company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities, including three refineries, five terminals, and approximately 116 service stations, for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist. In addition the Company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation. Under the Companys accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. The Companys liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites. Although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes, the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount. The EPA currently considers the Company to be a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at two Superfund sites. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial. Based on currently available information, the Company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at both Superfund sites. The Company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on Superfund sites. The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other Superfund sites. The Company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to clean up the two Superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on its net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. There is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites, and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites. However, based on information currently available to the Company, the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the Company from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at December 31, 2007. The Companys refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories: spent catalysts (usually hydrotreating catalysts); spent/used filter media; tank bottoms and API separator sludge; contaminated soils; laboratory and maintenance spent solvents; and various industrial debris. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to $3.9 million in 2007. In addition to these expenses, Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Such capital expenditures were approximately $70.8 million in 2007 and are projected to be $172.8 million in 2008. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Because crude oil and natural gas sales prices have generally strengthened during the last several years, prices for oil field goods and services have risen (with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant), and prices could continue to be adversely affected in the future. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services, although the Company anticipates escalation in prices for certain equipment and services as long as oil prices remain strong. 26 Table of Contents Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FSP AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, which prohibited effective January 1, 2007 the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities as historically used by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has chosen to use the permitted deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities such as refinery turnarounds beginning in 2007. Under the deferral method, the actual cost of each planned major maintenance activity is deferred and amortized through the next turnaround. All prior period financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of FSP AUG AIR 1 as if the deferral method was in effect in prior periods. A cumulative after tax adjustment to increase Retained Earnings of $50.8 million was recorded as of January 1, 2005 to effect the adoption of FSP AUG AIR 1. Net income for 2006 and 2005 have been restated to reflect the earnings for the periods as if FSP AUG AIR 1 had been in effect during the periods. The effect for the years 2006 and 2005 was an increase to net income of $6.4 million ($.04 per diluted share) and $8.3 million ($.04 per diluted share), respectively. As presented on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, the previously reported liability for Accrued Major Repair Costs of $71.2 million has been removed and a noncurrent asset of $37.4 million, representing the unamortized deferred costs of planned major maintenance activities as of that date, has been added to Deferred Charges and Other Assets. In association with the adoption of FSP AUG AIR 1, the Company will present expenditures for major repairs as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Refer to Note P for further information. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of SFAS Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132R. This statement requires the Company to recognize in its consolidated balance sheet the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This statement also requires that the Company measure the funded status of a plan as of December 31 rather than September 30 as previously permitted. The Company implemented this statement as to recognition of funded status as of December 31, 2006 and as to the year end measurement date as of January 1, 2007. The adoption of the year end measurement portion of this statement led to an adjustment to reduce Retained Earnings as of January 1, 2007 by $4.3 million. Refer to Note K for further information. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and requires additional financial statement disclosures about uncertain tax positions. Under FIN 48 the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority. If this threshold is met, the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company recognized a $0.7 million increase in its liability for unrecognized income tax benefits, which is included in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and it recognized a similar reduction of Retained Earnings. See Note I for further information. In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on the SECs views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 was effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, with early application for the first interim period ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard at December 31, 2006 had no impact on the Companys financial statements. In June 2006, the EITF finalized Issue 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement. The Task Force reached a consensus that this EITF applied to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. The EITF concluded that the presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue may be either gross (included in revenues and costs) or net (excluded from revenues and costs) and is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed by the Company. The Company excludes excise taxes collected on sales of refined products and remitted to governmental agencies from its revenues and costs of sales. In March 2005, the EITF decided in Issue 04 6 that mining operations should account for post production stripping costs as a variable production cost that should be considered a component of mineral inventory costs. The Companys synthetic oil operation at Syncrude is affected by this ruling, which was effective as of January 1, 2006 for the Company. The Company has determined that the level of bitumen inventory at Syncrude affected by this EITF consensus is immaterial and it has continued to expense post production stripping costs as incurred. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and where applicable simplifies and codifies related guidance within GAAP and does not require any new fair value measurements. The statement was originally effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2008. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157 2 that delayed for one year the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for most nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. Provisions of the Statement are to be applied prospectively except in limited situations. The Company does not expect the initial adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial statements. 27 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). This pronouncement permits companies with eligible financial assets and financial liabilities to measure these items at fair value in the financial statements. This option to measure at fair value is both instrument specific and irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected, certain additional disclosures are required and financial statements for periods prior to the adoption may not be restated. This pronouncement is effective January 1, 2008 for the Company. The Company is considering SFAS No. 159, and at this time the Company does not expect to elect the fair value option for any financial assets and financial liabilities. In June 2007, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Forces Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. This new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in 2008, and will require that income tax benefits received by the Company for dividends paid on share based incentive awards be recorded in Capital in Excess of Par Value in Stockholders Equity. Under certain circumstances, such tax benefits received on awards that do not vest could be reclassified to reduce income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company does not expect the adoption of this consensus to have a material impact on its financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51. Upon adoption, this statement will require noncontrolling interests to be reclassified as equity, and consolidated net income and comprehensive income shall include the respective results attributable to noncontrolling interests. This statement is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. It is to be applied prospectively and early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not expect this statement to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. This statement establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business. It also establishes how to recognize and measure goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, if applicable. This statement shall be applied prospectively by the Company to any business combination that occurs on or after January 1, 2009. Early application is prohibited. Assets and liabilities that arise from business combinations occurring prior to 2009 shall not be adjusted upon application of this statement. This statement will impact the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities in business combinations that occur after 2008, and the Company is unable to predict at this time how the application of this statement will affect its financial statements in future periods. Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below. Proved oil and natural gas reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require that year end oil and natural gas prices must be used for determining proved reserve quantities. Year end prices usually do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Companys depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. The Companys proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages F 35 and F 36 of the 2007 annual report. An unfavorable oil reserve revision in the U.S. in 2007 was mostly related to poor performance at one deepwater field in the Gulf of Mexico. Favorable oil reserve revisions in 2007 in Canada relate primarily to better performance at the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields. Favorable 2007 oil revisions in Malaysia relate to West Patricia and Kikeh well performances. The oil reserve revisions in 2006 in the U.S., Canada, Malaysia and Ecuador were based on performance of various local wells. The reserve revision in Malaysia in 2006 was mostly due to extension of proved oil in the Kikeh reservoir. The U.S. oil reserve revision in 2005 was mostly due to poor well performance at one deepwater Gulf of Mexico field. Oil reserve revisions in 2005 in Canada, the U.K. and Ecuador were due to better field performance, while the Malaysia revision was caused by higher oil prices that reduce volumes allocable to the Company for cost recovery under production sharing contracts. Downward revisions to U.S. natural gas reserves in 2007 and 2006 were mostly caused by unfavorable production performance for gas wells at various fields in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore south Louisiana. The favorable natural gas reserve revision in Canada in 2007 is mostly attributable to well performance at the natural gas field owned by a consolidated 28 Table of Contents subsidiary. The downward revision to 2007 natural gas reserves in Malaysia is based on higher contractual sales prices at year end 2007 compared to 2006. The significant upward revision of natural gas reserves in Malaysia in 2006 related to gas associated with the Kikeh field that will be sold to the local government beginning in 2008. The Company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs, all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. In some cases, a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves can not be made immediately. This is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon(s) found. The determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is, in turn, usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves. Under current accounting rules, the Company holds well costs in Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Costs for one exploration well in progress at year end 2007 amounted to $5.8 million. In January 2008, the well was determined to have successfully found hydrocarbon deposits and will be further evaluated for commerciality. Based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked, dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred. Dry hole expense related to wells drilled in a prior year was $3.4 million in 2006; there were no dry holes in 2007 or 2005 that were drilled in prior years. Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital and abandonment costs, future margins on refined products produced and sold, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable reserve revisions, expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a propertys carrying value for possible impairment. In making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment, the Company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices, future production volumes, and future capital and operating costs. Due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the Companys projections. Estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available. The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. In assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets, the Company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events, which include projections of future margins, future capital expenditures and future operating expenses. Future marketing or operating decisions, such as closing or selling certain assets, and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the Companys conclusion about potential asset impairment. Although the Company does not believe it had any significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at December 31, 2007, one or a combination of factors such as significantly lower future sales prices, significantly lower future production, significantly higher future costs, significantly lower future margins on refining and marketing sales, or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods. Based on these unknown future factors as described herein, the Company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future. Murphy holds a 20% interest in Block 16 Ecuador, where the Company and its partners produce oil for export. On October 18, 2007, the government of Ecuador enacted into law a levy that increases from 50% to 99% its share of oil sales prices that exceed a threshold reference price that was about $23.28 per barrel at December 31, 2007. The Company and its partners in Block 16 intend to initiate 29 Table of Contents arbitration proceedings with an international arbitrator as permitted by its participation contract. While arbitration proceedings are ongoing the Block 16 partners are actively negotiating contractual changes with the Ecuadorian government. Should the arbitration, negotiations and other designated security arrangements fail to permit the Company to recover its investment, the Company could have to record an impairment charge to reduce its investment in Block 16 in a future period. The Companys carrying value of fixed assets in Ecuador at December 31, 2007 amounted to $106.5 million. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property, equipment and inventories, and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for Blocks H, PM 311/312, P, L and M in Malaysia, exploration licenses in the Republic of Congo and certain basis differences in the U.K. due to managements belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are adjusted as necessary, generally based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds available within each country, and after cash flow analyses are performed to discount projected benefit payment streams. Expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs. Based on higher bond yields during 2007, the Company has increased the primary U.S. plans discount rate from 6.00% in 2007 to 6.50% in 2008 and beyond. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 7.00% for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations. The Companys normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in 2008 compared to 2007 as the effects from a growing employee base may not be fully offset by the effects of a higher discount rate. In 2007, the Company paid $12.2 million into various retirement plans and $3.5 million into postretirement plans. In 2008, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $56.6 million into various retirement plans and $4.7 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed 7.0%, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected. As described above, the Companys retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5 % decline in the discount rate would increase 2008 annual retirement and postretirement expenses by $3.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2008 retirement expense by $1.8 million. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company. 30 Table of Contents Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments, and other long term liabilities. In addition, the Company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period. Total payments due after 2007 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below. Amount of Obligation (Millions of dollars) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Total debt including current maturities $ 1,521.4 5.2 3.1 1,265.0 248.1 Operating leases 895.3 93.3 187.5 173.8 440.7 Purchase obligations 3,505.4 1,840.9 1,178.6 361.0 124.9 Other long term liabilities 626.9 90.3 69.7 53.3 413.6 Total $ 6,549.0 2,029.7 1,438.9 1,853.1 1,227.3 The Company has entered into an agreement to lease production facilities for the Kikeh field offshore Malaysia. In addition, the Company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section. The Companys share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the above table. In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amount of commitments as of December 31, 2007 that expire in future periods is shown below. Amount of Commitment (Millions of dollars) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Financial guarantees $ 8.5 8.5 Letters of credit 292.5 290.5 2.0 Total $ 301.0 290.5 10.5 Material off balance sheet arrangements The Company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes. The most significant of these arrangements at year end 2007 includes an operating lease of the Kikeh floating, production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO), an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract. The Kikeh FPSO lease calls for future monthly net lease payments over the next eight years. The processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the Medusa field in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the contract, the Company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility. If actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through 2009 is less than a specified quantity, the Company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time. Through 2007, actual production from the Medusa field has exceeded the contractual minimum volumes. The Company has a contract to purchase hydrogen for the Meraux refinery through 2021. The contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased. Payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid. Future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above. Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. A strong global economy, which fueled demand for energy, led to generally stronger prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products during 2007. Due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil and North American natural gas prices, especially in light of a potentially weakening world economy in early 2008, routine monitoring of spending plans is required. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2008 was prepared during the fall of 2007 and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to increase over 2007. Capital expenditures in 2008 are projected to total $2.8 billion. Of this amount, $2.1 billion or about 77%, is allocated for the exploration and production program. Geographically, E&P capital is spread approximately as follows: 14% for the United States, 49% for Malaysia, 21% for Canada and 16% for all other areas. Spending in the U.S. is primarily associated with continued development of producing and nonproducing deepwater fields as well as for the Companys Gulf of Mexico exploration program. In Malaysia, the majority of the spending is for continued development of the Kikeh field in Block K, where continued drilling will lead to additional wells being brought on production during 2008, and for development of natural gas fields in Blocks SK 309 and 311 offshore Sarawak where first production is anticipated in 2009. The bulk of Canadian spending in 2008 will relate to natural gas development at the Tupper field. Spending in the Republic of Congo includes continuing development costs for the Azurite discovery offshore. Refining and marketing expenditures in 2008 should be about $650 million of which about 80% is allocated for the U.S., including funds for further purchases of land underlying stations at Wal Mart Supercenters and construction of additional retail gasoline stations. Capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during 2008. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases, which often are not anticipated at the time the Budget is prepared. 31 Table of Contents The Company currently expects to fund its capital budget in 2008 using a combination of operating cash flow and available credit facilities. The Company forecasts an increase in long term debt of approximately $760 million in 2008. This forecast could change based on actual cash flow generated from operations and actual levels of capital spending. For example, a significant reduction in sales prices for crude oil and natural gas, without a corresponding decrease in capital spending, could cause the Companys long term debt to rise by more than the current forecast. Oil prices weakened slightly in January 2008 compared to prices experienced near the end of 2007, but in February oil prices rebounded to higher levels. These oil prices remained above the prices used in the Companys 2008 budget. Through early 2008, margins of the Companys refining and marketing operations were below amounts included in the Companys 2008 budget. The Company currently expects production in 2008 to average about 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A key assumption in projecting the level of 2008 Company production is the anticipated start up of natural gas production from Tupper in western Canada and offshore Malaysia. Oil production will continue to be ramped up at the Kikeh field throughout 2008. In addition, continued reliability of facilities at significant non operated fields such as Syncrude, Hibernia and Terra Nova are necessary to achieve the anticipated 2008 production levels. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K report, including documents incorporated by reference here, contains statements of the Companys expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that are forward looking and are dependent on certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of the Companys control. These forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and developments could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors including those described in the context of such forward looking statements as well as those contained in the Companys January 15, 1997 Form 8 K report on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. Murphy was a party to offsetting short term derivative instruments at December 31, 2007 for a notional amount of 403,000 barrels of oil that are intended to manage the purchase price of certain Meraux refinery crude oil. These contracts were marked to market at year end 2007 with a net charge of $40 thousand. A 10% increase or decrease in the price of crude oil would have had no impact on pretax income.
