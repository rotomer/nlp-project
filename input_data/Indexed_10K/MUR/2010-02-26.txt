Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in the United States and United Kingdom. A more detailed description of the Companys significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy generates revenue primarily by selling oil and natural gas production and refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the United States, Canada, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and other countries. The Companys revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells. Also, because crude oil is purchased by the Company for refinery feedstocks, natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil production facilities, and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the U.S. that are primarily located at Walmart Supercenters, the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the Companys costs. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration. Profits and generation of cash in the Companys refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins, which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing, transporting and marketing these products. Murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions. Worldwide oil and North American natural gas prices were significantly lower on average in 2009 than in 2008. The sales price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in 2009 averaged $62.05, 37% lower than in 2008. The NYMEX natural gas price averaged $3.94 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) in 2009, down 56% from 2008. Crude oil and North American natural gas prices fell precipitously with the economic decline in late 2008. The year 2009 began with quite low demand for hydrocarbons and consequently very weak prices for oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices generally rose as 2009 progressed as the worldwide economy began a slow recovery from the significant downturn. Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company, especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately 80% of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis by the Company in 2009. In 2010, the percentage of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to decline to about 70% due to higher natural gas production at Kikeh and Block SK 309 in Malaysia, Tupper in British Columbia and at the Eagle Ford shale area in South Texas. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas should weaken in 2010 or beyond, the Company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business. Such lower oil and gas prices could, but may not, have a favorable impact on the Companys refining and marketing operating profits. Results of Operations The Company generated net income in 2009 of $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) compared to net income in 2008 of $1.74 billion ($9.06 per diluted share). In 2007 the Companys net income was $766.5 million ($4.01 per diluted share). The large decline in 2009 net income in comparison to 2008 was attributable to lower earnings in both the exploration and production and refining and marketing operations. Weaker oil and natural gas sales prices were the primary reasons for lower 2009 earnings in the exploration and production business, while lower retail gasoline margins in the U.S. and weaker refining margins in the U.K. led to the earnings decline for refining and marketing. The significant increase in 2008 net income compared to 2007 was caused by improved earnings for exploration and production operations in 2008, primarily due to higher sales prices for the Companys oil and natural gas production, higher crude oil production volumes and gains on sale of two assets in Canada. The earnings for the Companys refining and marketing operations were an annual record in 2008, with the improvement from 2007 primarily in the U.K. and mostly caused by strong margins at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery following the Companys purchase of the remaining 70% of this asset in December 2007. The net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was lower in 2009 than in 2008, after rising in 2008 compared to the prior year. Further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections. Income from continuing operations, excluding results from Ecuador operations which are reported as discontinued operations, was $740.5 million ($3.85 per diluted share) in 2009, $1.74 billion ($9.08 per diluted share) in 2008, and $739.1 million ($3.87 per diluted share) in 2007. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2009 vs. 2008 Net income in 2009 totaled $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) compared to $1.74 billion ($9.06 per diluted share) in 2008. Net income included income from discontinued operations of $97.1 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in 2009 and a loss of $4.8 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2008. Discontinued operations are associated with the Companys former operations in Ecuador which were sold in March 2009. The favorable result from discontinued operations in 2009 was mostly attributable to an after tax gain of $103.6 million from disposal of the Ecuador properties. Income from continuing operations amounted to $740.5 million ($3.85 per diluted share) in 2009, down from $1.74 billion ($9.08 per diluted share) in 2008. The lower earnings in 2009 from continuing operations was attributable to lower income in the exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M) businesses. E&P income from continuing operations was $911.0 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily attributable to weaker sales prices for crude oil, which were down about $33.00 per barrel for the Companys production. Other unfavorable impacts in 2009 included a $58.4 million charge after taxes to effect an anticipated reduction in the Companys working interest in the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland, lower North American natural gas sales prices, gains on sale of Canadian assets in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009, and higher extraction costs for oil and gas produced in 2009. E&P results in 2009 benefited from higher volumes of oil and gas produced, lower exploration expenses and after tax income of $158.3 million from an anticipated recovery of federal royalties paid between 2003 and 2009 on certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Income from R&M operations was $242.1 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008, essentially attributable to two factors weaker retail gasoline marketing margins in the U.S. and weaker refining margins in the U.K. The net cost of corporate activities was $148.8 million less in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to gains from transactions denominated in foreign currencies in 2009 compared to losses on such transactions in 2008. During 2009 the U.S. dollar generally weakened in comparison to the British pound sterling, which provided a favorable foreign currency impact to the Companys earnings. Additionally, the current year benefited from higher interest income, including interest due to the Company through December 31, 2009 on the anticipated federal royalty refund, and lower net interest expense. Sales and operating revenues were $8.4 billion lower in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to lower prices realized on gasoline and other fuels sold by the Company. Crude oil and natural gas sales prices were also lower in 2009 than 2008. But these lower prices were partially offset by income of $244.4 million in 2009 associated with an anticipated recovery of federal royalties previously paid by the Company on certain Gulf of Mexico properties. Gain on sale of assets classified in continuing operations was $130.0 million less in 2009 than 2008 principally due to significant gains on two assets sold in Canada in 2008 Berkana Energy and the Lloydminster properties. Interest and other income in 2009 was $152.5 million higher than 2008 due to a combination of more favorable income effects from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and interest income on the anticipated recovery of federal royalties. Crude oil and product purchases expense was $7.1 billion less in 2009 than 2008 due mostly to the lower cost of gasoline purchased for resale in the U.S. retail marketing operations. Operating expenses in 2009 were $35.6 million less than 2008 mostly due to lower natural gas and other power costs in the most recent year at synthetic oil operations in Canada and at the Companys three refineries. Exploration expenses in 2009 were $79.2 million below 2008 primarily due to less spending on geophysical data in the U.S., Canada and Malaysia, and less amortization expense for undeveloped leasehold costs in the Tupper area in Western Canada. Selling and general expenses rose $13.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a combination of higher costs for employee compensation and professional services. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was up $251.8 million in 2009 mostly due to higher oil and natural gas production volumes and higher depreciation rates per barrel of oil equivalents produced, with the higher costs mostly caused by new fields that came on stream in 2009. Impairment of long lived assets of $5.2 million in 2009 was attributable to write off of the remaining net book value for one underperforming natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased $1.7 million in 2009 primarily due to future abandonment costs to be incurred on oil and gas wells drilled in Malaysia in 2009. A charge of $83.5 million was recorded in 2009 to reflect the estimated cash settlement to be paid on an anticipated reduction in the Companys working interest in the Terra Nova field from the present 12.0% to about 10.5%. This redetermination process at Terra Nova is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. Interest expense in 2009 was $20.6 million less than 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates charged on certain bank loans during the just completed year. Interest capitalized to oil and gas development projects in 2009 was $2.8 million below the 2008 level due to commencement of production at the Thunder Hawk and Azurite oil fields in the third quarter 2009. Income tax expense was $537.0 million less in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to lower pretax income in the current year. The effective tax rate on a consolidated basis increased from 38.1% in 2008 to 42.0% in 2009 due to a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in 2009 and due to higher exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses will be realized in future years to reduce taxes owed. The tax rate in both years was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state income taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceed the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the Companys uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years. Income from discontinued operations was $101.9 million higher in 2009 than 2008 mostly due to an after tax gain of $103.6 million on sale of Ecuador operations in March 2009. 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2008 vs. 2007 Net income in 2008 was $1.74 billion ($9.06 per diluted share) compared to $766.5 million ($4.01 per diluted share) in 2007. The consolidated net income improvement of $973.5 million in 2008 was attributable to higher earnings in both E&P and R&M operations. The net cost of corporate activities in 2008 was higher than in 2007, partially offsetting the improved results in E&P and R&M. Earnings from continuing E&P operations were markedly improved in 2008, increasing by $974.2 million compared to 2007, as this business benefited from higher sales prices for oil and natural gas, higher sales volumes for crude oil and gains from asset dispositions. E&P earnings were unfavorably affected in 2008 compared to 2007 by lower sales volumes for natural gas and higher expenses for exploration, production, depreciation, depletion and administration. The R&M business generated record profits in 2008, increasing $108.1 million compared to 2007. The improvement was primarily due to refining profits generated in the U.K. in 2008 following the acquisition of the remaining 70% of the Milford Haven, Wales, refinery in December 2007. R&M earnings in 2007 included an unfavorable impact in the U.K. from noncash inventory revaluations. Following the Milford Haven acquisition, the Companys U.K. operations recorded an after tax noncash last in, first out inventory charge of $59.5 million in 2007 to reduce the carrying value of crude oil and refined products inventory to beginning of year prices, which were significantly lower than at the end of the year. The net costs of corporate activities increased by $76.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007, with the cost increase mostly attributable to higher losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and higher net expenses for interest and administration. The foreign currency losses occurred because the U.S. dollar generally strengthened against other significant foreign currencies used in the Companys business in 2008, especially compared to the British pound sterling. The higher net interest expense was mostly caused by lower interest capitalized to E&P development projects. The 2008 period included higher corporate administrative costs mostly due to higher expense for employee compensation and community and other support activities. Sales and other operating revenues were $9.1 billion higher in 2008 than in 2007 mostly due to higher sales prices and sales volumes for gasoline and other refined products, higher sales prices and sales volumes for crude oil produced by the Company, and higher revenues from merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations. Sales prices for natural gas were higher in 2008 than 2007, but the favorable price variance was somewhat offset by lower natural gas sales volumes in 2008. Gain/(loss) on sales of assets in 2008 was $134.1 million higher than in 2007 and these realized pretax gains were primarily associated with the sale of interests in Berkana Energy and the Lloydminster area heavy oil properties in Canada. Interest and other income was lower by $77.7 million in 2008 due primarily to greater losses on foreign currency exchange, which were mostly attributable to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the British pound sterling. Crude oil and product purchases expense increased by $6.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a combination of higher purchase prices and throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks at the Companys refineries, higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations, and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at the gasoline stations. The higher crude oil purchase volumes in 2008 were caused by a full year of operations at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery following the December 2007 acquisition of the remaining 70% interest. Operating expenses increased by $382.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007 and included higher refinery and retail station costs, and higher costs for oil field operations in Malaysia and synthetic oil operations at Syncrude. Refining costs increased due to both higher natural gas and other fuel costs and the full year of operations at Milford Haven following the 2007 acquisition. Exploration expenses were $141.6 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 and were primarily associated with higher leasehold amortization expenses at the Tupper area in Western Canada, more dry hole expense in Malaysia and Australia, and higher geophysical expenses in Suriname. Exploration expenses in 2007 included costs for settlement of two work commitments on leases formerly held on the Scotian Shelf offshore Eastern Canada. Selling and general expenses were $0.2 million higher in 2008 than in 2007. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $216.6 million higher in 2008 compared to 2007 due mostly to higher crude oil production volumes, but also due to higher barrel equivalent unit rates for depreciation for virtually all E&P segments and higher depreciation for the remaining 70% of the Milford Haven, Wales refinery acquired in December 2007. Impairment of long lived assets of $40.7 million in 2007 primarily related to closing 55 underperforming gasoline stations in the U.S. and Canada. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by $8.2 million in 2008 due to additional abandonment obligations incurred as additional Kikeh development wells were drilled during the year and higher estimated costs of future abandonment obligations at Syncrude. Net costs associated with hurricanes of $3.0 million in 2007 was due to a downward adjustment of anticipated insurance recoveries at the Meraux refinery following Hurricane Katrina based on updated loss limits communicated in 2007 by the Companys primary property insurer. Interest expense incurred in 2008 was $1.1 million less than in 2007 due to lower average debt levels during 2008 compared to the prior year. The amount of interest costs capitalized to property, plant and equipment decreased by $18.4 million in 2008 due to lower levels of interest allocable to worldwide E&P development projects. Income tax expense was $623.7 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 and was mainly attributable to a higher level of pretax earnings. The effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings increased from 37.8% in 2007 to 38.1% in 2008. The tax rate in both years was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements combination of U.S. state income taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceed the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the uncertain ability of the Company to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years. The results of discontinued operations in 2008 were unfavorable to 2007 by $32.2 million primarily due to a higher revenue sharing with the government of Ecuador. During 2008, the government claimed a 99% share of Block 16 realized sales prices that exceeded a benchmark price that escalated with the monthly U.S. Consumer Price Index. This government revenue sharing claim increased from 50% above the benchmark price to 99% in October 2007. At year end 2008, the benchmark oil price for Block 16 was approximately $23.36 per barrel. The average realized sales price after revenue sharing with the Ecuadorian government for Block 16 oil was $27.83 per barrel during 2008, a decrease of 24% from 2007. The higher revenue sharing led to unprofitable operating results in 2008 for operations in Ecuador. The Company sold the Ecuador properties in March 2009. Segment Results In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2009 are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Exploration and production Continuing operations United States $ 178.0 156.6 98.2 Canada 64.8 588.7 370.2 Malaysia 561.9 865.3 148.2 United Kingdom 12.6 73.8 47.6 Republic of the Congo (20.6 ) (1.1 ) (14.1 ) Other (104.9 ) (80.5 ) (21.5 ) 691.8 1,602.8 628.6 Refining and marketing North America 92.2 227.9 230.4 United Kingdom (20.5 ) 85.9 (24.7 ) 71.7 313.8 205.7 Corporate and other (23.0 ) (171.8 ) (95.2 ) Income from continuing operations 740.5 1,744.8 739.1 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 97.1 (4.8 ) 27.4 Net income $ 837.6 1,740.0 766.5 Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production continuing operations were $691.8 million in 2009, $1.60 billion in 2008 and $628.6 million in 2007. E&P income from continuing operations in 2009 was $911.0 million less than in 2008 primarily due to significantly lower realized sales prices for the Companys crude oil production in 2009. The 2009 period was also unfavorably affected by several other factors, including lower North American natural gas sales prices, higher production and depreciation expenses, a $58.4 million after tax charge in 2009 for an anticipated reduction of its working interest in the Terra Nova field, and higher gains on asset sales in 2008 compared to 2009. The just completed year benefited from higher oil and natural gas sales volumes, lower exploration expense and after tax income of $158.3 million from an anticipated recovery of previously paid federal royalties on production from certain Gulf of Mexico properties. Crude oil, condensate and gas liquids sales volumes from continuing operations were 8% higher in 2009 compared to 2008, compared to an increase in oil production volumes of 18% in 2009. Oil sales volumes did not rise as much as oil production volumes during 2009 primarily due to the timing of oil tanker liftings at the Kikeh field offshore Malaysia. Sales volumes at Kikeh were below production levels in 2009 due to an increase in the volume of unsold barrels at the field at year end and a higher percentage of such unsold inventory barrels at the field being attributable to the Companys account. During 2008, Kikeh sales volumes exceeded production, which effectively reduced the Companys unsold inventory balance from year end 2007. Higher U.S. crude oil sales volume in 2009 was primarily attributable to a partial year of production at the Gulf of Mexico Thunder Hawk field, which started up in July 2009, and less downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for hurricanes. Lower crude oil sales volumes in Canada in 2009 were mostly attributable to the sale of the Lloydminster heavy oil field in early 2008 and production declines at the maturing Hibernia and Terra Nova fields. Lower crude oil sales volume in the U.K. in 2009 was primarily due to no lifting at the Schiehallion field in the current year. Damage to sales equipment at the Schiehallion production facility caused the Companys scheduled lifting in December 2009 to be deferred until 2010. Crude oil sales volumes at Kikeh in 2009 rose compared to 2008 due to higher annual production. Natural gas sales volumes increased 237% in 2009 and the improvement was partially attributable to higher gas volumes produced during 2009 in the Gulf of Mexico, the Tupper area in Western Canada and at Kikeh, and partially due to new production at the Sarawak gas fields offshore Malaysia following start up in September 2009. The Companys realized crude oil sales prices averaged 37% less in 2009 than 2008 and North American natural gas sales prices averaged 63% below 2008 levels. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements E&P earnings improved $974.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 with the significant increase primarily due to higher realized sales prices for the Companys oil and natural gas production, higher crude oil production volumes and gains on disposals of Canadian assets. Results in 2007 were favorably impacted by income tax benefits associated with tax rate reductions in Canada. The 2008 results were unfavorably affected compared to 2007 by lower natural gas sales volumes and higher expenses for exploration, production, depreciation, depletion, administration and accretion of discounted abandonment liabilities. Crude oil sales volumes from continuing operations in 2008 were 49% higher than in 2007, compared with a 34% increase in crude oil production from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007. Crude oil sales volumes grew more than production in 2008 due to the timing of sale transactions as the Company had a lower inventory of unsold crude oil at year end 2008 compared to a year earlier. The significant unsold crude oil inventory at year end 2007 was mostly at Kikeh where sales volumes lagged production in late 2007 during the start up phase of this field. During 2008, oil sales volumes were higher than in 2007 as larger volumes produced at the Kikeh field were partially offset by lower oil sales volumes at most other producing areas. Lower U.S. crude oil sales volumes in 2008 were primarily due to reduced production levels at several Gulf of Mexico fields following Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Certain Gulf of Mexico facilities owned by other companies downstream of our producing fields were shut down for repairs for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter 2008. Lower oil sales volumes in Canada were attributable to field decline at Hibernia, field decline and a higher royalty rate at Terra Nova, sale of the Lloydminster heavy oil property in Western Canada and more downtime at Syncrude. Lower crude oil sales volumes in the U.K. and at the West Patricia field, offshore Sarawak Malaysia, were mostly caused by production declines as these fields mature. Natural gas sales volumes were 9% lower in 2008 than 2007 and the reduction was mostly due to the sale of Berkana Energy in January 2008. Additionally, several of the Companys Gulf of Mexico fields were either shut in or had curtailed gas production in late 2008 while downstream facilities owned by others were repaired following third quarter hurricanes. The Companys average realized oil sales price was 37% higher in 2008 than 2007, and the average North American natural gas sales price was 33% higher in 2008. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 44 and F 45 of this Form 10 K report. Average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 5 of the 2009 Annual Report. A summary of oil and gas revenues, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2009 2008 2007 United States Oil and gas liquids $ 374.8 374.0 310.8 Natural gas 80.6 162.1 121.7 Canada Conventional oil and gas liquids 365.6 775.8 628.6 Synthetic oil 288.5 459.6 351.4 Natural gas 68.6 5.5 23.0 Malaysia Oil and gas liquids 1,478.4 1,985.6 436.0 Natural gas 45.4 0.1 United Kingdom Oil and gas liquids 54.7 189.4 129.5 Natural gas 6.4 25.8 16.6 Republic of the Congo Oil and gas liquids 24.5 Total oil and gas revenues $ 2,787.5 3,977.9 2,017.6 The Companys total crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production (including discontinued operations in Ecuador) averaged 131,839 barrels per day in 2009, 118,254 barrels per day in 2008 and 91,522 barrels per day in 2007. Oil production in the U.S. increased from 10,668 barrels per day in 2008 to 17,053 barrels per day in 2009 with the increase mostly caused by start up of the Thunder Hawk field in July 2009 and higher production at the Medusa and Front Runner fields in the current year. Production of heavy oil in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin was 6,813 barrels per day in 2009, down from 8,484 barrels per day in 2008, primarily due to the sale of the Lloydminster property in early 2008 and due to decline at properties operated by a third party in the Seal area. Oil production offshore Canada fell from 16,826 barrels per day in 2008 to 12,357 barrels per day in 2009 due to field decline at Terra Nova and field decline and a higher net profit royalty rate at Hibernia. Synthetic oil operations at Syncrude had net production of 12,855 barrels per day in 2009, up from 12,546 barrels per day in 2008, with the increase caused by a lower royalty 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements rate in 2009 due to sales prices significantly below those of the prior year. Oil production in Malaysia increased from 57,403 barrels per day in 2008 to 76,322 barrels per day in 2009, with the increase primarily due to higher production at the Kikeh field, which recorded peak production levels in the current year. Oil production in Malaysia was also favorably affected in 2009 by condensate produced at the Sarawak gas fields that started up in September 2009 and higher net production at the West Patricia field. A higher portion of production at West Patricia was allocated to the Companys account in 2009 as costs incurred for development of Sarawak gas fields increased the level of West Patricia oil used to recover costs under the production sharing contract for Blocks SK 309 and SK 311. Oil production in the U.K. was 3,361 barrels per day in 2009, down from 4,869 barrels per day in 2008, with the decline primarily due to more downtime at the Schiehallion field, most of which was caused by damage to the export hose that required production to be shut in for nearly all of the fourth quarter. The Azurite field offshore Republic of the Congo came on production in August 2009 and averaged 1,743 barrels per day for the full year. The Company sold its interest in Block 16 and other areas in Ecuador in March 2009 and has accounted for Ecuador as discontinued operations. Oil production in Ecuador averaged 7,412 barrels per day in 2008 and 1,317 barrels per day in 2009. Production of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids in 2008 increased by 26,732 barrels per day, or 29% compared to 2007, primarily due to continued ramp up of the Kikeh field. Light oil production in Canada declined from 596 barrels per day in 2007 to 46 barrels per day in 2008 due to sale of Berkana Energy in January 2008. Heavy oil production in Western Canada fell from 11,524 barrels per day in 2007 to 8,484 barrels per day in 2008, due to sale of the Lloydminster property in 2008 and lower production volumes at the Seal field in Alberta. Oil production at Hibernia, offshore Newfoundland, was 8,542 barrels per day in 2008, up slightly from 8,314 barrels per day in 2007. Oil production decreased at Terra Nova, offshore Newfoundland, from 10,557 barrels per day in 2007 to 8,284 barrels per day in 2008. The 2008 reduction at Terra Nova was attributable to natural field decline plus a higher royalty rate. Syncrude production totaled 12,546 barrels per day in 2008 compared to 12,948 barrels per day in 2007, with the decline caused by more downtime for repairs and maintenance in 2008. Oil production declined in the U.S. from 12,989 barrels per day in 2007 to 10,668 barrels per day in 2008. The reduction was primarily at Gulf of Mexico fields where production was curtailed while awaiting repairs to downstream facilities owned by other companies that were damaged by third quarter hurricanes. Oil production in the U.K. was down from 5,281 barrels per day in 2007 to 4,869 barrels per day in 2008, with the reduction caused by declining production at the Companys primary fields in the North Sea. The West Patricia field, offshore Sarawak Malaysia, had net production of 4,403 barrels per day in 2008 after production levels of 8,709 barrels per day in 2007. West Patricia experienced declining production and a smaller portion of production was allocated to the Companys account under the production sharing contract. Oil production from discontinued operations in Ecuador totaled 7,412 barrels per day in 2008, compared to 8,946 barrels per day in 2007 due to a shut down of the Block 16 development drilling program during 2008 following an arbitrary decision by the government to impose a 99% revenue sharing provision starting in late 2007 on all sales prices exceeding a benchmark price that averaged about $23.50 per barrel during the year. Worldwide sales of natural gas were 187.3 million cubic feet (MMCF) per day in 2009, 55.5 MMCF per day in 2008 and 61.1 MMCF per day in 2007. Natural gas production in the U.S. averaged 54.2 MMCF per day in 2009, compared to 45.8 MMCF per day in 2008. The higher volume in 2009 was primarily attributable to the Mondo NW field that reached peak production in the current year, start up of the Thunder Hawk field in July 2009 and less downtime in the Gulf of Mexico due to hurricanes. Natural gas production in Canada rose from 1.9 MMCF per day in 2008 to 54.9 MMCF per day in 2009 due to ramp up of Tupper area production in Western Canada. Tupper started up in December 2008. Natural gas production in Malaysia also rose significantly as the Sarawak gas development started up in September 2009 and Kikeh gas production, which started up in December 2008, was onstream for a full year in 2009. Natural gas production during 2009 at Sarawak and Kikeh averaged 28.1 MMCF per day and 46.6 MMCF per day, respectively. Natural gas production in the U.K. fell from 6.4 MMCF per day in 2008 to 3.5 MMCF per day in 2009 primarily due to the Amethyst field being shut in for the first four months of 2009 for equipment repairs. Natural gas sales volumes in the United States averaged 45.8 MMCF per day in 2008 compared to 45.1 MMCF per day in 2007. The increase of 0.7 MMCF per day in 2008 would have been significantly higher but for the reduced gas production associated with hurricane damage to downstream facilities late in the year. Natural gas sales volumes in Canada averaged 1.9 MMCF per day in 2008, down from 9.9 MMCF per day in 2007. In January 2008, the Company sold Berkana Energy, formerly its largest gas producing asset in Canada. Natural gas sales volumes in the U.K. averaged 6.4 MMCF per day in 2008 compared to 6.0 MMCF per day in 2007. The higher U.K. gas sales volumes were mostly attributable to more gas volumes sold at the Mungo and Monan fields in the North Sea. Natural gas production commenced from the Kikeh field offshore Sabah Malaysia in December 2008 and sales volumes averaged 1.4 MMCF per day for the year. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Companys average worldwide realized sales price for crude oil, condensate and gas liquids from continuing operations fell from $89.16 per barrel in 2008 to $56.41 per barrel in 2009. The decline of 37% was attributable to lower average prices in 2009 for crude oil and matches the decline in the average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil during the year. Crude oil prices began to weaken in late 2008 as the economic downturn worsened. Crude oil prices started 2009 at low levels due to a weakening worldwide demand for energy. But oil prices improved as the year progressed and in December 2009 WTI averaged $74.38 per barrel. Compared to 2008, the Companys average 2009 crude oil sales prices fell 37% in the U.S. to $60.08 per barrel; heavy oil prices in Canada fell 31% to $40.45 per barrel; offshore Canada oil was sold for 40% less and averaged $58.19 per barrel; synthetic crude oil sold for 39% less at $61.49 per barrel; crude oil in Malaysia was down 37% and averaged $55.51 per barrel; and U.K. crude oil production sold for 32% less at $61.31 per barrel. The Companys average worldwide realized crude oil, condensate and gas liquids sales price from continuing operations was $89.16 per barrel in 2008 compared to $65.15 per barrel in 2007. This was an increase of 37% in 2008. In the U.S., the Company realized an average price of $95.74 per barrel in 2008, up 46% from 2007. The average sales price in 2008 for heavy oil produced in Canada was $59.05 per barrel, 80% higher than in 2007. Hibernia and Terra Nova sales prices averaged $97.09 and $96.23 per barrel, respectively, during 2008, which were increases of 36% and 40%. Synthetic oil production sold for $100.10 per barrel in 2008, up 35% from a year earlier. U.K. oil prices increased 32% to $90.16 per barrel in 2008. In Malaysia, oil produced at the Kikeh field sold for 2% less in 2008 than in 2007, with an average of $89.36 per barrel for 2008. Kikeh came on stream in August 2007 and all sales during that year occurred in the fourth quarter when prices were at the strongest point during 2007. At the West Patricia field offshore Sarawak the 2008 average sales price of $72.04 per barrel was 22% above the 2007 average price. The Companys natural gas sales prices fell significantly in 2009 compared to 2008 as weaker demand for energy led to an oversupply of natural gas inventories. The Companys average realized North American natural gas sales prices were $3.57 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2009, a decline of 63% from the $9.54 per MCF realized in 2008. In the U.K. the average sales price fell from $10.98 per MCF in 2008 to $5.04 per MCF in 2009. Natural gas produced in 2009 offshore Sarawak was sold at an average price of $4.05 per MCF during the year. The Companys natural gas sales prices rose in 2008 compared to 2007. The Companys average realized North American natural gas sales prices increased by 33% in 2008 to $9.54 per thousand cubic feet (MCF). In the U.K., the average 2008 natural gas price rose 46% to $10.98 per MCF. Based on 2009 sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1.00 per barrel and $0.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected 2009 earnings from exploration and production continuing operations by $28.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. Production expenses from continuing operations were $654.5 million in 2009, $611.5 million in 2008 and $425.9 million in 2007. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 44 and F 45 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table. (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2009 2008 2007 United States $ 10.62 10.01 10.75 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 9.44 9.44 8.77 Synthetic oil 36.64 41.08 30.56 Malaysia 8.00 10.31 12.60 United Kingdom 17.97 13.21 10.34 Republic of the Congo 43.51 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 9.21 10.24 10.23 Production expense per equivalent barrel in the U.S. increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to start up of the Thunder Hawk field in July 2009. Production costs per barrel decreased in the U.S. in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower costs incurred for workovers and repairs at fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The per unit cost for Canadian conventional oil and gas operations, excluding synthetic oil, was flat in 2009 compared to 2008 as the benefit of a full year of natural gas production at Tupper was offset by lower production volumes without a comparable reduction in costs at Hibernia and Terra Nova. Cost per barrel in the Canada conventional area was higher in 2008 than 2007 mostly due to lower production levels. Lower cost per barrel in 2009 compared to 2008 at Canadian 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements synthetic oil operations was mostly caused by lower natural gas fuel costs. The increase in production costs per barrel for synthetic oil in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to higher costs for fuel and repairs and lower production levels. Production cost per unit in Malaysia was lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher oil production at Kikeh, and new natural gas production offshore Sarawak and higher natural gas production at Kikeh that collectively altered the production mix toward lower cost natural gas in the current year. The lower average cost per barrel in Malaysia in 2008 compared to 2007 was attributable to higher production at Kikeh where unit costs per equivalent barrel are lower than at West Patricia. Higher per barrel production expense in the U.K. in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower production levels at the Schiehallion and Amethyst fields, both of which were offline for repairs for a portion of 2009. The increase in the average cost per barrel in the U.K. in 2008 versus 2007 was caused by lower overall production levels and higher repair costs. The high per unit production cost in Republic of the Congo in 2009 is expected to be significantly lower in future years due to higher production associated with a full year of operations at the Azurite field beginning in 2010. Exploration expenses from continuing operations for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 44 and F 45 on this Form 10 K report. Expenses other than leasehold amortization are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2009 2008 2007 Dry holes $ 125.3 129.5 66.8 Geological and geophysical 40.5 85.2 67.7 Other 16.2 17.7 35.1 182.0 232.4 169.6 Undeveloped lease amortization 83.2 112.0 33.2 Total exploration expenses $ 265.2 344.4 202.8 Dry hole expense was $4.2 million lower in 2009 than 2008 due to more successful exploratory drilling results during a year with higher drilling capital expended. During 2009, lower dry hole costs in Malaysia and the U.S. was somewhat offset by higher costs in Australia and Republic of the Congo. Dry hole expense was $62.7 million more in 2008 than in 2007 and was attributable to more exploration drilling capital expenditures in 2008. With mostly new E&P management in 2007, much of that year was spent reevaluating the Companys worldwide exploration drilling prospects. The higher costs for dry holes in 2008 was mostly in the offshore waters of Malaysia and Western Australia. Geological and geophysical (G&G) expenses were $44.7 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008. The reduction in G&G in 2009 was attributable to less spending on seismic in the Gulf of Mexico, the Tupper area in Western Canada, and offshore Sabah in Malaysia, but 2009 included higher spending for seismic covering the Semai II concession, offshore Indonesia. G&G expenses were $17.5 million higher in 2008 mostly due to a 3D seismic program at Block 37, offshore Suriname, and more seismic activities in the Tupper area in Western Canada. Other exploration costs were $1.5 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008 mostly due to less office costs allocable to Republic of the Congo exploration activities in the current year. Other exploration expense in 2008 was $17.4 million lower than 2007 mostly due to a $21.9 million settlement in 2007 for unfulfilled work commitments on two expiring Scotian Shelf leases, offshore Eastern Canada. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense was $28.8 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008 mostly due to lower amortization for Tupper and Tupper West area leases in Western Canada, but partially offset by higher lease amortization cost at Eagle Ford shale leases in South Texas in the current year. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose $78.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to amortization of undeveloped land acquisition costs at the Tupper property where the Company aggressively added undeveloped acreage in recent years. An impairment charge of $5.2 million was recorded in 2009 to write off the remaining costs of a poorly performing natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. A $2.6 million charge in the exploration and production business for asset impairment in 2007 related to write down of an unused E&P administrative office to estimated fair value. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for exploration and production continuing operations totaled $775.8 million in 2009, $527.8 million in 2008 and $337.6 million in 2007. The $248.0 million increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to a combination of higher overall hydrocarbon production levels and start up of new fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Western Canada and Republic of the Congo that had higher per unit depreciation rates than older fields already on production. The increase in expense of $190.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 was mostly caused by a much higher production level at the Kikeh field, offshore Sabah, Malaysia. The exploration and production business recorded expenses of $25.5 million in 2009, $23.5 million in 2008 and $16.1 million in 2007 for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities. Because the abandonment liability is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment. The increase in accretion costs in 2009 compared to 2008 was mostly attributable to additional wells drilled in the current year at the Kikeh and Sarawak fields, offshore Malaysia. The increase in accretion costs in 2008 was associated with higher estimated abandonment costs at Syncrude and additional development wells drilled at the Kikeh field. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The effective income tax rate for exploration and production continuing operations was 40.8% in 2009, 37.4% in 2008 and 34.2% in 2007. The effective tax rate was higher in 2009 than 2008 due to both higher expenses in foreign tax jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be currently recognized due to lack of sufficient revenue to realize a current benefit and a higher percentage of profits in Malaysia where the effective tax rate of 38% is higher than the effective rates in the U.S. and Canada. The effective tax rate was higher in 2008 than the previous year as 2007 included net tax benefits from an enacted reduction of the federal tax rate in Canada. The net benefit from the Canadian tax rate reduction, which effectively reduced recorded deferred tax liabilities, was $38.7 million in 2007. The effective tax rates in 2009 and 2008 exceeded the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to higher overall foreign tax rates and exploration activities in areas where current tax benefits cannot be recorded by the Company. The effective tax rate in 2007 was slightly below the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the enacted Canadian federal tax rate reduction during the year. A $4.4 million U.S. tax benefit was realized in 2007 for a charitable building donation. Tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include non revenue generating areas in Malaysia, Suriname, Australia and Indonesia. Each main exploration area in Malaysia is currently considered a distinct taxable entity and expenses in certain areas may not be used to offset revenues generated in other areas. No tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for Blocks H, P, L and M, offshore Sabah, and Blocks PM 311/312, offshore Peninsula Malaysia. At December 31, 2009, approximately 31% of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 18% of the U.S. proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped. Virtually all of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves (on a barrel of oil equivalent basis) are associated with the Companys various deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. Further drilling, facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed. In Block K Malaysia, virtually all oil reserves of 14.7 million barrels for the Kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling directed by another company. Also in Malaysia, there were 294.9 billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore Sarawak at year end 2009, which were held under this category pending completion of development drilling and facilities. On a worldwide basis, the Company spent approximately $1.34 billion in 2009, $783 million in 2008 and $769 million in 2007 to develop proved reserves. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing (R&M) operations generated earnings of $71.7 million in 2009 following record earnings of $313.8 million in 2008. Earning from R&M operations were $205.7 million in 2007. The R&M earnings decline of 77% in 2009 compared to 2008 was driven primarily by significantly weaker margins in the U.S. retail fuel marketing business and lower refining margins in the U.K. The 53% improvement in 2008 earnings compared to 2007 was caused by favorable U.K. refining profits following the acquisition of the remaining 70% of the Milford Haven refinery in December 2007, and nonrecurring charges in 2007 for a last in, first out (LIFO) inventory writedown in the U.K. and retail gasoline station impairments in North America. The Companys North American R&M operations generated earnings of $92.2 million in 2009, $227.9 million in 2008 and $230.4 million in 2007. North American operations include refining activities in the United States, marketing activities in the United States and Canada, and ethanol production operations in the U.S. North American R&M earnings fell significantly in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to weaker margins in the Companys retail gasoline chain. Fuel margins in the retail chain were hurt in 2009 by both lower demand for gasoline and diesel due to the weak economy and generally rising wholesale fuel costs caused by crude oil prices that rose gradually during the year. Results for the refining business in the U.S. was slightly improved in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to insurance proceeds at the Meraux, Louisiana plant, and higher asphalt sales volumes and better asphalt margins at the Superior, Wisconsin plant. Final insurance settlements at the Meraux refinery for Hurricane Katrina related property damage and a crude oil spill and damages caused by a 2003 fire provided pretax benefits of $32.6 million during 2009. On October 1, 2009, the Company acquired an ethanol production facility in Hankinson, North Dakota. The ethanol facility generated profitable operations in the fourth quarter 2009 due to the favorable spread between corn prices and ethanol sales prices. North American R&M earnings were down slightly in 2008 compared to 2007 as lower profits generated by the U.S. refining operations were not fully offset by significantly stronger retail marketing profits in 2008. Demand for gasoline declined in the U.S. in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher costs and a weakening economy. This lower demand led to much tighter crack spreads for U.S. refineries in 2008 compared to 2007. Crack spreads represent the uplift of gasoline and distillate prices over the cost of crude oil feedstocks. The 2007 operating results for the Companys North American refining business were negatively impacted by Hurricane Katrina related costs of $3.0 million, which was caused by a downward adjustment of expected insurance recoveries based on an updated loss limit estimated by the Companys primary insurer. The Companys refinery in Superior, Wisconsin also generated 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements weaker earnings in 2008 than in 2007 as a result of tighter crack spreads in the later year. North American retail gasoline station operations had improved results in 2008 compared to 2007 as this business enjoyed higher per gallon margins, higher sales volumes and lower store closure costs compared to the prior year. The Company recorded impairment expense of $38.2 million in 2007 associated with closures of 55 underperforming stores, including 47 in the U.S. and all eight stations in Canada. Unit margins (sales realization less costs of crude and other feedstocks, transportation to point of sale and refinery operating and depreciation expenses) averaged $2.45 per barrel in North America in 2009, compared $4.30 per barrel in 2008 and $4.28 per barrel in 2007. Meraux refinery throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks averaged 109,725 barrels per day in 2009, 103,169 barrels per day in 2008 and 112,840 barrels per day in 2007. Superior refinery throughput volumes averaged 32,280 barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks in 2009, compared to 26,770 barrels per day in 2008 and 33,392 barrels per day in 2007. Both U.S. refineries were temporarily shut down for turnaround activities during 2008. North American refined product sales volumes increased 1% to a record 432,700 barrels per day in 2009, following a 3% increase to 427,490 barrels per day in 2008. The increase in 2009 was mostly attributable to more finished products produced at the U.S. refineries, plus the addition of ethanol production from the facility acquired in October 2009. The retail marketing business built 23 stations in 2009, following additions of 52 stations in 2008. The U.S. retail marketing network included 1,048 stations at year end 2009. Station additions were purposefully restricted in 2009 based on lower Company consolidated cash flow compared to 2008. This operations business model of always offering competitive fuel prices usually leads to increased sales volumes during periods of high gasoline prices such as in the first nine months of 2008. In 2008, fuel sales volumes per station increased for the 11th consecutive year, and were 10% higher than 2007. However, in 2009 average site fuel sales fell by 4% due to lower demand for gasoline in the U.S. Operations in the United Kingdom incurred a loss of $20.5 million in 2009 compared to earnings of $85.9 million in 2008 and a loss of $24.7 million in 2007. The loss in 2009 for U.K. R&M operations was primarily due to very weak margins at the Companys Milford Haven, Wales refinery. The refining margin was hurt by weak demand for refined products during the period, which led to an industry wide oversupply of gasoline and diesel products in the area during 2009. The improved U.K. earnings in 2008 compared to 2007 were mostly related to profits generated by the Milford Haven refinery as the refinery generated stronger margins in 2008 and the 2007 period included a significant inventory charge. The Company acquired 100% of the Milford Haven, Wales refinery on December 1, 2007, after having a 30% interest in the asset prior to that date. In association with the late 2007 Milford Haven acquisition, the Company built a significant additional layer of crude oil and refined products inventory. The 2007 period included a $59.5 million after tax non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of these higher inventory levels to early 2007 prices. Under the Companys LIFO inventory accounting policy, inventory volume increases are priced at the first purchase prices during the year, and the prices of crude oil and refined products were at a much lower level in early 2007 compared to the price at the time these products were acquired near year end 2007. The LIFO inventory charge reduced the average carrying value for these additional inventories in the U.K. by approximately $40 per barrel. In late 2008, the Company purchased six existing fuel stations and leased 63 stations in England and Scotland. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $0.50 per barrel in 2009, $4.30 per barrel in 2008 and $0.22 per barrel in 2007. Overall sales of refined products in the U.K. declined 7% to 103,774 barrels per day in 2009, essentially due to lower production of finished products at the Companys Milford Haven, Wales refinery. Sales of refined products in the U.K. increased more than 200% in 2008 compared to the prior year, which was attributable to additional quantities of refined products produced and sold throughout 2008 at the Milford Haven refinery following the Companys acquisition of the remaining 70% interest in December 2007. Corporate The after tax costs of corporate activities, which include interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, were $23.0 million in 2009, $171.8 million in 2008 and $95.2 million in 2007. The net cost of corporate activities in 2009 was $148.8 million lower than in 2008, primarily due to more favorable effects of foreign currency exchange, which is associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the respective operations predominant functional currency. The effect of foreign currency exchange after taxes in the corporate segment was a gain of $33.3 million in 2009 compared to a cost of $87.8 million in 2008. The favorable effects in 2009 were primarily associated with the Companys U.K. downstream operations where a significant amount of transactions for this sterling functional currency business are denominated in U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar generally weakened against the British pound sterling in 2009 after having gained significant ground on the U.K. currency during 2008. Foreign currency transaction effects in Canada, Malaysia and other foreign countries were generally not significant for the full year 2009. The corporate area also benefited in 2009 from higher interest income of $10.9 million compared to 2008, principally due to $42.0 million of interest recognized on an anticipated recovery of U.S. federal royalties previously paid on certain production in the Gulf of Mexico. The interest on royalties more than 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements offset lower interest earned in 2009 on cash deposits and other longer term investments as these amounts attracted much lower interest rates during 2009 compared to the prior year. Net interest expense, after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects, was $17.8 million less in 2009 than 2008, principally due to lower interest rates charged on certain borrowings under the Companys credit facilities. Certain of these facilities charge interest based on a spread above LIBOR rates, which were held low in 2009 due to weakness in the overall economy. Administrative and depreciation expenses associated with corporate activities were both slightly higher in 2009 compared to 2008. Income tax expense in 2009 was significantly unfavorable to 2008 in the corporate area primarily due to the aforementioned favorable pretax variances for foreign exchange, interest income and net interest expense. The net cost of corporate activities increased $76.6 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher costs associated with foreign exchange where transactions are denominated in currencies other than the operations functional currency. Additionally, interest costs, net of amounts capitalized to development projects, and administrative costs were also higher in 2008 than in 2007. The after tax costs of foreign currency exchange amounted to $87.8 million in 2008 compared to costs of $13.8 million in 2007. The additional costs were primarily related to U.S. dollar transactions within the U.K.s sterling functional downstream operations, as these dollar transactions expanded significantly with the 70% addition of Milford Haven, Wales refinery ownership beginning in December 2007. At year end 2008 the U.S. dollar had strengthened 28% against the British pound sterling, 5% against the Euro, and 18% against the Canadian dollar compared to the end of 2007. Net interest expense increased $17.4 million in 2008 compared to 2007 mostly due to lower amounts of interest capitalized to ongoing oil and gas development projects during 2008. Administrative expenses in the corporate area increased in 2008 primarily due to higher total compensation expense and higher contributions to community and educational programs in the current year. Interest income increased $6.6 million in 2008 versus 2007 and was mostly associated with higher average short term invested funds in Canada and the U.K. Income taxes in 2008 were favorable to 2007, and were primarily related to benefits on the higher foreign exchange losses and higher net interest expense as discussed above. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 17 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures, including exploration expenditures, were $2.21 billion in 2009 compared to $2.36 billion in both 2008 and 2007. These amounts included capital expenditures of $0.8 million in 2009, $6.9 million in 2008 and $40.4 million in 2007 related to discontinued operations in Ecuador. Capital expenditures included $182.0 million, $232.4 million and $169.6 million, respectively, in 2009, 2008 and 2007 for exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production continuing operations totaled $1.81 billion in 2009, $1.93 billion in 2008 and $1.74 billion in 2007, representing 82%, 82% and 75%, respectively, of the Companys total capital expenditures from continuing operations for these years. E&P capital expenditures in 2009 included $118.1 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, which primarily included leases acquired in the Eagle Ford shale area of South Texas and at the Tupper area in Western Canada, $307.6 million for exploration activities, and $1.38 billion for development projects. Development expenditures included $197.2 million at the Tupper and Tupper West natural gas areas in Western Canada, $195.5 million for deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico; $237.5 million for the Kikeh field in Malaysia; $392.8 million for natural gas and other development activities in SK Blocks 309/311; $49.2 million for development of the Kakap field in Block K, offshore Malaysia; $46.1 million for synthetic oil operations at the Syncrude project in Canada; $25.6 million for Western Canada heavy oil projects; $186.3 million for development of the Azurite field in Republic of the Congo; $24.3 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland; and $17.3 million for fields in the U.K. North Sea. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 43 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled $375.9 million in 2009, $426.2 million in 2008 and $572.5 million in 2007. These amounts represented 17%, 18% and 25% of capital expenditures from continuing operations of the Company in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Refining capital spending was $206.0 million in 2009 compared to $141.8 million in 2008 and $330.0 million in 2007. Refining spending in 2009 mostly included projects at Meraux for benzene reduction, distillate hydrotreater revamp and crude oil storage expansion; a sulfur recovery project at Superior; and a crude oil capacity expansion project at Milford Haven. The Milford Haven project will increase the crude throughput capacity of the refinery to 130,000 barrels per day when completed in 2010. Refining capital in 2008 included project costs for additional sulfur recovery capacity and property acquisition and improvements at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery, and a cogeneration energy plant at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery. The 2007 refining capital included $240.7 million for acquisition of the remaining 70% of the Milford Haven, Wales refinery. Most of the remaining refinery capital in 2007 was related to property acquired surrounding the Meraux refinery. Marketing expenditures amounted to $78.5 million in 2009, $284.4 million in 2008 and $242.5 million in 2007. Marketing capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily associated with new station builds and other improvements within the U.S. retail gasoline station network. Marketing capital spending in 2008 was split between station construction costs and land acquisitions costs for existing and future retail 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements gasoline stations. The capital spending in 2007 was mostly attributable to acquisition of land underlying retail gasoline stations located at Walmart Supercenters. The Company added 23 stations within its U.S. retail gasoline network in 2009, after adding 52 in 2008 and 33 in 2007. The Company also spent $92.0 million in 2009 to acquire an ethanol production facility in Hankinson, North Dakota. The ethanol plant was financed with an $82.0 million nonrecourse loan from the seller and a cash payment of $10.0 million. See Note D of the consolidated financial statements for further details about this acquisition. Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $1.86 billion in 2009, $3.04 billion in 2008 and $1.74 billion in 2007. Cash provided by continuing operations in 2009 was $1.18 billion less than in 2008 primarily due to lower net income and an increase in working capital in 2009 mostly associated with an anticipated recovery of U.S. federal royalties and related interest thereon. Cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $1.30 billion more than in 2007 primarily due to higher net income, higher depreciation and higher exploration drilling expenditures. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by expenditures for abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $48.7 million in 2009, $9.2 million in 2008 and $13.0 million in 2007. Cash proceeds from property sales classified as continuing operations were $1.6 million in 2009, $362.0 million in 2008 and $21.6 million in 2007. The 2008 proceeds related to sales of two of the Companys Canadian assets, including its interest in Berkana Energy and the Lloydminster heavy oil property, and a sale of 35% of its working interest in the MPS block offshore Republic of the Congo. The sales proceeds in 2007 primarily related to sales of various assets. During 2009, the Company generated cash of $78.9 million from the sale of its 20% working interest in Block 16 in Ecuador. The results of Ecuador operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. During 2008, the Company used available cash flow to repay $492.8 million of long term debt. During 2009 and 2007, the Company borrowed $243.5 million and $686.2 million, respectively, through long term debt primarily to fund a portion of the Companys development capital expenditures. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans, including income tax benefits on stock options classified as financing activities, amounted to $16.9 million in 2009, $50.0 million in 2008 and $72.4 million in 2007. Proceeds from maturities of Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at date of acquisition were $2.17 billion in 2009 and $623.1 million in 2008. Property additions and dry hole costs used cash of $1.98 billion in 2009, $2.18 billion in 2008 and $1.91 billion in 2007. Cash used to pay for capital expenditures was down in 2009 compared to 2008 essentially in line with lower capital expenditures in the latter year. The higher capital expenditures in 2008 compared to 2007 were primarily associated with a more robust exploration program and higher spending on development projects including Kikeh development drilling, Sarawak natural gas, Kakap, Azurite, Tupper and Thunder Hawk. In 2009, the Company paid $10.0 million to partially finance the acquisition of the Hankinson, North Dakota ethanol plant; the remaining $82.0 million was financed with a seller provided nonrecourse loan. In December 2007, the Company spent $348.3 million to acquire the remaining 70% interest in the Milford Haven, Wales refinery and associated inventory. Cash of $2.53 billion and $1.04 billion was spent in 2009 and 2008, respectively, to acquire Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase. Cash of $30.3 million in 2009, $57.6 million in 2008 and $14.6 million in 2007 was used for turnarounds at refineries and Syncrude. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $190.8 million in 2009, $166.5 million in 2008 and $127.4 million in 2007. The Company raised its annualized dividend rate from $0.75 per share to $1.00 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2008. The Company had previously increased the annualized dividend rate from $0.60 per share to $0.75 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2007. Financial Condition Year end working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) totaled $1.19 billion in 2009 and $958.8 million in 2008. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying value for inventories under last in, first out accounting was $551.2 million below fair value at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 totaled $301.1 million compared to $666.1 million at year end 2009. The long term portion of debt, including nonrecourse loans, increased by $327.0 million during 2009 and totaled $1.35 billion at year end 2009, representing 15.6% of total capital employed. Long term debt decreased by $489.0 million in 2008 as the Company utilized available free cash flow arising primarily from strong crude oil sales prices to repay a portion of long term debt during 2008. Stockholders equity was $7.35 billion at the end of 2009 compared to $6.28 billion a year ago and $5.07 billion at the end of 2007. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 6 of this Form 10 K report. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other significant changes in Murphys year end 2009 balance sheet compared to 2008 included a $358.7 million increase in the balance of short term investments in Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase. The total investment in these Canadian government securities was $779.0 million at year end 2009. These slightly longer term investments were purchased in 2009 and 2008 because of a tight supply of shorter term securities available for purchase in Canada. A $429.3 million increase in accounts receivable was caused by anticipated recoveries of federal royalties and associated interest totaling $286.4 million at year end 2009 and sales of crude oil and refined petroleum products at higher average prices near the end of 2009 compared to 2008. Inventory values were $129.8 million higher at year end 2009 than in 2008 mostly due to more unsold crude oil production held in inventory at year end 2009 compared to 2008 and higher valued refined products held in storage at year end 2009. Prepaid expenses decreased $9.3 million in 2009 primarily due to lower prepaid insurance costs and lower prepaid U.K. taxes compared to 2008. Short term deferred income tax assets were $14.8 million less at year end 2009 compared to 2008 due mostly to the tax effects of lower retirement plan liabilities owed in the upcoming year. Net property, plant and equipment increased by $1.34 billion in 2009 as a significant level of property additions during the year exceeded the additional depreciation and amortization expensed. Goodwill increased $3.3 million in 2009 due to a stronger Canadian dollar exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. Deferred charges and other assets decreased $262.1 million mostly due to an asset derecognition of equipment under construction in prior years since this equipment is now in use under operating lease arrangements. Current maturities of long term debt declined $2.5 million during 2009 primarily due to the final repayment of nonrecourse debt associated with the Hibernia field. Accounts payable increased by $364.9 million at year end 2009 compared to 2008 mostly due to higher amounts owed for crude oil purchases by the Companys refineries, plus higher amounts owed for capital expenditures in Malaysia and for estimated amounts related to redetermination of working interest at Terra Nova. Income taxes payable was $64.2 million lower at year end 2009 primarily due to lower pretax income in 2009. Other taxes payable were $13.9 million higher mostly due to greater excise taxes owed by the Companys U.S. downstream operations and more excise and value added taxes owed by the U.K. downstream operations at year end 2009 compared to 2008. Other accrued liabilities were down by $18.6 million in 2009 mostly due to lower employee retirement plan liabilities classified as a current liability at December 31, 2009. Deferred income tax liabilities were $140.6 million more at year end 2009 due to a higher foreign exchange rate causing Canadian liabilities to exceed the prior year amount and an additional year of accelerated tax depreciation associated with the Companys 2009 capital expenditures. The liability associated with future asset retirement obligations increased by $41.3 million mostly due to development wells drilled during 2009 offshore Malaysia. Deferred credits and other liabilities were $262.2 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008 mostly due to derecognition of liabilities associated with equipment previously under construction that is now in use by the Company under operating lease arrangements. Murphy had commitments for future capital projects of approximately $1.34 billion at December 31, 2009, including $839.5 million for field development and future work commitments in Malaysia, $93.2 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields and $71.0 million for field development and a work commitment in Republic of the Congo. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2009, the Company had access to a long term committed credit facility in the amount of $1.962 billion. A total of $625.0 million was borrowed under the committed credit facility at year end 2009. The most restrictive covenants under this committed credit facility limit the Companys long term debt to capital ratio (as defined in the agreements) to 60%. The committed credit facility expires in 2012. At December 31, 2009, the Company had borrowed $47.0 million under uncommitted credit lines, and the long term debt to capital ratio was approximately 15.7%. In September 2009, the Company filed a Form S 3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the offer and sale of debt and or equity securities. The Company may use this shelf registration, if needed, in future years to raise debt or equity capital to fund operational requirements. This shelf registration expires in September 2012. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note F to the consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates matching its spending plans to cash inflows during 2010 in order to borrow little or no funds under its available credit facilities during the year. However, if future oil and natural gas prices and or refining and marketing margins weaken significantly, the Company may have to borrow under these credit facilities to fund ongoing development projects. At February 26, 2010, the Companys long term debt rating by Standard & Poors was BBB and by Moodys Investors Service was Baa3. The Company has a rating of A (low) from Dominion Bond Rating Service. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 16.7 to 1 in 2009, 28.3 to 1 in 2008 and 14.0 to 1 in 2007. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Environmental Matters Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects our overall cost of business. Areas affected include capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities, in concert with ongoing operating costs for environmental compliance. Anticipated and existing regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings, and they may affect our competitive position to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that our competitors might not bear. Environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities, and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on our operations. Violation of federal or state environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and construction bans or delays. A discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject us to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting our U.S. operations are: The U.S. Clean Air Act, which regulates air emissions The U.S. Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges into U.S. waters The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes The U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States The U.S Safe Drinking Water Act, which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells Regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations. These laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air, water and solid waste discharges. They also generally require permits for new or modified operations. Many states and foreign countries where the Company operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products, which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements. We are also subject to certain acts and regulations, including legal and administrative proceedings, governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations, which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines, underground storage tanks and general environmental operations. CERCLA commonly referred to as the Superfund Act, and comparable state statutes primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon Potentially Responsible Parties (PRP), without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released, disposed, or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLAs definition of a hazardous substance. We may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment. CERCLA also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous and must be reported to the National Response Center, if they exceed an EPA established reportable quantity. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The EPA currently considers us to be a PRP at two Superfund sites. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial. However, based on current negotiations and available information, we believe that we are a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at these Superfund sites. We have not recorded a liability for remedial costs on Superfund sites. We could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at these sites or other Superfund sites. We believe that our share of the ultimate costs to clean up the Superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on Murphys net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled. Although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. While some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation, investigation, and or cleanup, we are investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on Murphys net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes. We generate non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. Our operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories: spent catalysts (usually hydrotreating catalysts); spent/used filter media; tank bottoms and API separator sludge; contaminated soils; laboratory and maintenance spent solvents; and industrial debris. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes. Such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses. Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and such capital expenditures were $109.2 million in 2009 and are projected to be $146.9 million in 2010. Our liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites. Although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes, the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount. Certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by us from other sources, primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states. Since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur, we have not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of December 31, 2009. We are also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in our operations. Under our accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. Under OPA90, owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such OPA90 claims made against Murphy. The EPA has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels, primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline, which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel is used. Several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels. The EPAs mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline became effective in 2008 and both of our U.S. refineries are now capable of producing the required low sulfur 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements gasoline. Each of the U.S. refineries must begin to produce the EPA required ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) beginning in 2010. The Meraux refinery is currently capable of producing this ULSD for all of its diesel production, and at the Superior refinery equipment is being installed which will make the refinery capable of meeting the ULSD standard by the June 2010 compliance date. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was signed into law in December 2007. The EISA through EPA regulation requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production. EISA greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the Renewable Fuels Standard which began in September 2007. Murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to meet its obligation. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA) imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The FWPCA imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. We maintain wastewater discharge permits for our facilities where required pursuant to the FWPCA and comparable state laws. We have also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws. We believe that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Our U.S. operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which we operate. Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act enacted in late 1990 require or will require most refining operations in the U.S. to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the EPA and state environmental agencies. Under the EPAs Clean Air Act authority, the National Petroleum Refinery (NPR) Initiative (Global Consent Decree) was initiated as a national priority to investigate four marquee compliance areas for refinery operations: (i) New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration for fluidized catalytic cracking units, heaters and boilers; (ii) New Source Performance Standards for flares, sulfur recovery units, fuel gas combustion devices (including heaters and boilers); (iii) Leak Detection and Repair requirements; and (iv) Benzene National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Murphy began negotiations with the EPA in 2005, but was interrupted by the events of Hurricane Katrina. The states of Louisiana and Wisconsin are both parties to the NPR. Negotiations with EPA resumed in 2007 and are continuing. While substantial progress has been made in these negotiations, the Company expects to conclude NPR negotiations in 2010 and will at that time have estimates of any additional capital and operating costs and penalty assessments, if any, which may be required because of the EPAs findings. Our Meraux, Louisiana refinery is also currently negotiating with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regarding three Compliance Order/Notice of Proposed Penalty (CO/NOPP) notifications regarding air and water discharges. While we are in various stages of negotiations and or settlement, the Company has proposed a settlement offer related to these CO/NOPP negotiations. The Company does not expect the settlement of this matter to have a material adverse effect on Companys net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. World leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. As part of these discussions, the Kyoto Agreement was adopted in 1997 and was ratified by certain countries in which we operate or may operate in the future, with the United States being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement. The agreement became effective for ratifying countries in 2005 and these countries have implemented regulations or are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents that ultimately target a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. We are unable to predict how U.S. regulations (if any) associated with the Kyoto Agreement will impact costs in future years. The European Union has adopted an Emissions Trading Scheme in response to the Kyoto Agreement in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Our refining operations at Milford Haven currently have the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements. These environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred. Currently, various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include a recently promulgated EPA regulation, Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, which became effective December 29, 2009, and existing proposed U.S. federal legislation (Cap and Trade Legislation, EPAs Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, Low Carbon Fuel Standards, etc.) and various state actions to 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements develop statewide or regional programs, each of which have or could impose mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The impact of existing and pending climate change legislation, regulations, international treaties and accords could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities; (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities; and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions trading program. These actions could also impact the consumption of refined products, thereby affecting our refinery operations. The physical impacts of climate change present potential risks for severe weather (floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.) at our Meraux, Louisiana refinery in southern Louisiana and our offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Commensurate with this risk is the possibility of indirect financial and operational impacts to the Company from disruptions to the operations of major customers or suppliers caused by severe weather. The Company has repositioned itself to take advantage of potential climate change opportunities by acquiring a renewable energy source through the acquisition of an ethanol production facility in Hankinson, North Dakota, thereby achieving a lower carbon footprint and an enhanced capability to meet governmental fuel standards. The Company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, or the cost impact of natural catastrophic events resulting from climate change, if it occurs, will be in future periods. The Company recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship as a core component of its mission as a responsible international energy company and has implemented sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to process climate change related information. Indeed, our Environmental, Health, and Safety Committee is a standing committee of the Board of Directors created to oversee and monitor the Companys environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policies and practices. Further, in February 2009, our Board approved a worldwide environmental, health, and safety policy (the EHS Policy), which is available on the Companys Web site. In addition to requiring that the Company comply with all applicable EHS laws and regulations, the EHS Policy includes a directive that the Company will continue to minimize the impact of our operations, products and services on the environment by implementing economically feasible projects that promote energy efficiency and use natural resources effectively. We likewise apply this conscientious approach to the issue of climate change. As a companion to the EHS Policy, the Companys Web site also contains a statement on climate change. Not only does this statement on climate change include our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis while growing our upstream and downstream operations, the information on our Web site describes actions we have already taken to move towards that goal. While we are admittedly at the beginning of a process that will grow over time, the Company has formed an internal Climate Change Workgroup to address emerging climate change issues and improve energy efficiencies via the development of an Energy Efficiency Forum. This Climate Change Workgroup is developing a comprehensive climate change plan aimed at preparing the company to succeed in a world challenged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The plan includes incorporating climate change into our planning processes, reducing our own emissions, pursuing new opportunities and engaging legislative and regulatory entities externally. Greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted since 2001. Moreover, a Low Carbon Fuel Standard sub committee was formed in 2009 to monitor, evaluate and develop implementation plans that may arise in connection with state climate change consortiums to legislate fuel standards. Although the initiatives cited above demonstrate the Companys focus on environmental issues at the forefront of todays global public policy dialogue, the Companys commitment in this area is nothing new. For example, in 2003 the Company completed its Clean Fuels Project at the Meraux refinery, making it one of the first refineries able to produce 100 percent low sulfur gasoline, thereby reducing emissions and meeting or bettering current sulfur fuels standards. As a result of this Clean Fuels initiative, the Company estimates that the Meraux refinerys low sulfur gasoline reduces vehicle emissions by more than 2,000 tons per year. Murphy is actively engaged in the legislative and regulatory process, both nationally and internationally, in response to climate change issues and to protect our competitive advantage. Additionally, Murphy participates in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. Safety Matters We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In 2007, OSHA announced a National Emphasis Program (NEP) for inspecting all refineries in the U.S. for compliance with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. OSHA conducted an inspection of our Meraux, Louisiana refinery from July September 2009 and on December 29, 2009 OSHA issued several compliance related citations and a proposed penalty. The matter was settled with OSHA through payment of a $63,000 penalty with many of the OSHA items abated and agreement of a compliance schedule that calls for all items to be abated in 2010. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen (with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant) during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services when oil and gas prices were strong. As noted earlier, oil and natural gas prices were considerably weaker in late 2008 and early 2009; however, the prices for oil goods and services did not generally decline as significantly as oil and gas prices. Oil prices, and to a lesser extent natural gas prices, rebounded somewhat in 2009 from the low levels experienced in late 2008 and early 2009. Should a low price environment for oil and gas return, the Company anticipates that prices for certain equipment and services will decline due to falling demand for such items. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements The Company adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements effective January 1, 2009. This guidance is to be applied prospectively, except for presentation and disclosure requirements which are applied retrospectively. This guidance required noncontrolling interests to be reclassified as equity, and consolidated net income and comprehensive income shall include the respective results attributable to noncontrolling interests. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted new accounting guidance covering business combinations effective January 1, 2009. The new guidance established principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business. It also established how to recognize and measure goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, if applicable. This guidance impacts the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities in business combinations that occur beginning in 2009. Assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations that occurred prior to 2009 are not affected by this guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company is unable to predict how the application of this guidance will affect its financial statements in future periods. The Company adopted new accounting guidance which addresses disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in January 2009. This guidance expands required disclosures regarding derivative instruments to include qualitative information about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantities disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. See Note L of this Form 10 K for further disclosures. In 2009, the Company adopted new accounting guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities. This guidance specifies that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings per share (EPS) calculation under the two class method, and also requires that all prior period EPS calculations be adjusted retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Companys prior period EPS calculations. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company adopted new accounting guidance addressing certain equity method investment accounting considerations in January 2009, which has been applied prospectively. The guidance addresses how to initially measure contingent consideration for an equity method investment, how to recognize other than temporary impairments of an equity method investment, and how an equity method investor is to account for a share issuance by an investee. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted new accounting guidance addressing subsequent events effective June 30, 2009. The guidance clarified the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date through the date of issuance of the applicable financial statements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note U of this Form 10 K for further disclosures. The FASBs Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ended after September 15, 2009 (the third calendar quarter for Murphy Oil) and it recognized the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernment U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The codification superseded all existing accounting standards documents issued by the FASB, and established that all other accounting literature not included in the codification is considered nonauthoritative. Although the codification does not change U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, it does reorganize the principles into accounting topics using a consistent structure. The codification also includes relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance following the same topical structure. For periods ending after September 15, 2009, all references to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles will use the new topical guidelines established with the codification. Otherwise, this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements in future periods. The FASB has provided additional guidance regarding disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets, including how asset investment allocation decisions are made, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, and how fair value is determined for each major asset category. This guidance was effective for the Company as of December 31, 2009. Upon adoption, no comparative disclosures are required for earlier years presented. See Note K of this Form 10 K for additional disclosures. In December 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted revisions to oil and natural gas reserves reporting requirements which became effective for the Company at year end 2009. The primary changes to reserves reporting include: A revised definition of proved reserves, including the use of unweighted average oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year to compute such reserves, Expanding the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include non traditional and unconventional resources, which includes the Companys synthetic oil operations in Alberta, Allowing companies to voluntarily disclose probable and possible reserves in SEC filings, Amending required proved reserve disclosures to include separate amounts for synthetic oil and gas, Expanding disclosures of proved undeveloped reserves, including discussion of such proved undeveloped reserves five years old or more, and Disclosure of the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the Companys overall reserve process. The Company utilized this new guidance at year end 2009 to determine its proved reserves and to develop associated disclosures. The Company chose not to provide voluntary disclosures of probable and possible reserves in this Form 10 K. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets. This guidance makes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined previously no longer relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying special purpose entities must be reevaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and is unable to predict at this time how it will impact its consolidated financial statements in future periods. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance that requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the entity or the right to receive potentially significant benefits from the entity. A company is required to make ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This guidance also amends previous guidance for determining whether an entity is considered a variable interest entity. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and is unable to predict at this time how it will impact its consolidated financial statements in future periods. Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below. Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require that we use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining proved reserve quantities. These historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Companys depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. The Companys proved reserves of oil and gas are presented on pages F 41 and F 42 of this Form 10 K. A favorable oil reserve revision in 2009 in the United States was attributable to favorable performance of the Thunder Hawk and Front Runner fields and federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields. A favorable conventional oil revision in Canada in 2009 was caused by performance of the Terra Nova field and improved heavy oil pricing which added reserves in the Seal area. Due to changes in the SECs definition of proved oil reserves, which were first effective as of December 31, 2009, synthetic oil reserves are now included as proved oil reserves. Consequently, total synthetic oil reserves as of January 1, 2009 of 131.6 million barrels have been added to total oil reserves in 2009. The positive revision to synthetic oil reserves during 2009 was attributable to lower royalties compared to a year ago. An unfavorable revision to oil reserves in Malaysia in 2009 was due to current year drilling results for a well in the Kikeh field, along with reduced entitlements at Kikeh and West Patricia due to increased prices as compared to year end 2008. Oil reserves in the U.K. reflected an unfavorable revision in 2009 because of an anticipated reduction in life expectancy for major equipment at the Schiehallion project. An unfavorable U.S. oil revision in 2008 resulted from updated reservoir modeling of one field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. An unfavorable revision in Canada in 2008 was related to low heavy oil prices at year end, but this was partially offset by a favorable impact from better field performance in 2008 at Hibernia. A favorable oil reserve revision in Malaysia in 2008 was attributable to better than anticipated drilling results and additional drilling opportunities in the main reservoir at the Kikeh field, coupled with better reservoir performance and artificial lift improvements at the West Patricia field. An unfavorable oil reserve revision in the U.S. in 2007 was mostly related to poor performance at one deepwater field in the Gulf of Mexico. Favorable oil reserve revisions in 2007 in Canada related primarily to better performance at the Hibernia 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and Terra Nova fields. Favorable 2007 oil revisions in Malaysia related to West Patricia and Kikeh well performances. In the U.S., a positive gas reserve revision in 2009 was caused by favorable performance of the Thunder Hawk, Front Runner and Mondo NW fields as well as federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields. In Malaysia, a combination of increased entitlements due to pricing and drilling performance at the Sarawak gas project led to positive gas revisions in 2009. Gas reserves in the U.K. were favorably revised in 2009 because of the Amethyst field gas compression project and better Mungo field performance. An unfavorable natural gas reserve revision in Malaysia in 2008 was related to entitlement adjustments under the Sarawak Blocks SK 309 and SK 311 production sharing contract and gas volumes lost due to operational delays that restricted sales volumes at the Kikeh field, offshore Sabah. The downward revisions to U.S. natural gas reserves in 2007 was mostly caused by unfavorable production performance for gas wells at various fields in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore south Louisiana. The favorable natural gas reserve revision in Canada in 2007 was mostly attributable to well performance at the natural gas field owned by a consolidated subsidiary. The downward revision to 2007 natural gas reserves in Malaysia is based on higher contractual sales prices at year end 2007 compared to 2006. The Company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs, all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. In some cases, a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves cannot be made immediately. This is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon(s) found. The determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is, in turn, usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves. Under current accounting rules, the Company holds well costs in Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked, dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred. There were no dry holes in 2009, 2008 or 2007 that were drilled in prior years. Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital and abandonment costs, future margins on refined products produced and sold, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable reserve revisions, expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a propertys carrying value for possible impairment. In making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment, the Company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices, future production volumes, and future capital and operating costs. Due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the Companys projections. Estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available. The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. In assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets, the Company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events, which include projections of future margins, future capital expenditures and future operating expenses. Future marketing or operating decisions, such as closing or selling certain assets, and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the Companys conclusion about potential asset impairment. Impairment expense of $5.2 million was recorded in 2009 to write off the remaining carrying value of one underperforming natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end 2009, the Company does not believe it had any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date. The expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods. These quoted prices often reflect higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the time of assessment. If quoted prices for future years had been lower, the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in 2009. In addition, one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices, lower future production, higher future costs, lower future margins on refining and marketing sales, or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods. Based on these unknown future factors as described herein, the Company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property, equipment and inventories, and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for Blocks H, PM 311/312, P, L and M in Malaysia, exploration licenses in Republic of the Congo, Suriname and Australia, and certain basis differences in the U.K. due to managements belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs. Based on bond yields at year end 2009, the Company has used a discount rate of 5.90% in 2009 and beyond for the primary U.S. plans. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 6.50% for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations. The Companys normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in 2010 compared to 2009 based on the effects of a growing employee base. In 2009, the Company paid $50.8 million into various retirement plans and $4.4 million into postretirement plans. The 2009 retirement plan contribution included a voluntary contribution 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of $30.0 million to the primary U.S. retirement plan. In 2010, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $20.8 million into various retirement plans and $5.8 million for postretirement plans. Approximately $10.2 million of these anticipated payments in 2010 are not mandatory. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed 6.5%, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected. As described above, the Companys retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5% decline in the discount rate would increase 2010 annual retirement and postretirement expenses by $4.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2010 retirement expense by $1.8 million. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company. Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments, and other long term liabilities. In addition, the Company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period. Total payments due after 2009 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below. Amount of Obligation (Millions of dollars) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Total debt including current maturities $ 1,353.2 1,038.8 65.1 249.3 Operating leases 1,078.9 146.8 276.9 253.9 401.3 Purchase obligations 2,218.3 1,550.3 488.3 51.2 128.5 Other long term liabilities 660.4 23.0 45.7 53.2 538.5 Total $ 5,310.8 1,720.1 1,849.7 423.4 1,317.6 The Company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields. In addition, the Company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section. The Companys share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above. In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amount of commitments as of December 31, 2009 that expire in future periods is shown below. Amount of Commitment (Millions of dollars) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Financial guarantees $ 7.8 3.2 4.6 Letters of credit 102.9 61.3 40.0 1.6 Total $ 110.7 61.3 40.0 3.2 6.2 Material off balance sheet arrangements The Company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes. The most significant of these arrangements at year end 2009 includes operating leases of floating, production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSO) for the Kikeh and Azurite oil fields, an operating lease for a production facility at the Thunder Hawk field, a natural gas transportation contract for the Tupper area in Western Canada and a hydrogen purchase contract for the Meraux refinery. The leases call for future monthly net lease payments through 2015 at Kikeh, through 2016 at Azurite, and through 2014 at Thunder Hawk. The Tupper transportation contract requires minimum monthly payments through 2013. The Meraux refinery contract to purchase hydrogen ends in 2021. The hydrogen contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased. Future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. A strong global economy during 2007 and the first half of 2008, which fueled demand for energy, led to high prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products. Beginning in the second half of 2008 and continuing into early 2009, crude oil prices fell precipitously from the highs at mid year 2008. As the worldwide economy started to show signs of improvement in 2009, crude oil prices began to strengthen. The change in the prices for crude oil is primarily attributable to the level of demand for energy. In January 2010, West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded in a band between $73 and $83 per barrel. NYMEX natural gas has traded in a band of $5 to $6 per MMBTU. Refining and marketing margins were very weak in January 2010 and these operations in the U.S. and U.K. were showing operating losses during this time. The Company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending based on these prices. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2010 was prepared during the fall of 2009 and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to be slightly above 2009 levels. Since the budget was approved by the Companys Board of Directors, crude oil prices have generally been above the levels assumed in the 2010 budget, but North American natural gas prices have generally trailed the budgeted prices. Based on a recent review of capital expenditure projects, capital expenditures in 2010 are projected to total approximately $2.4 billion. Of this amount, $2.0 billion or about 83%, is allocated for the exploration and production program. Geographically, E&P capital is spread approximately as follows: 23% for the United States, 34% for Malaysia, 30% for Canada and 13% for all other areas. Spending in the U.S. is primarily associated with continued development of producing and nonproducing deepwater fields as well as for the Companys Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford shale exploration programs. In Malaysia, the majority of the spending is for continued development of natural gas fields in Blocks SK 309 and SK 311 offshore Sarawak and at the Kikeh and Kakap fields in Block K. The bulk of Canadian spending in 2010 will relate to natural gas developments at the Tupper and Tupper West areas in Western Canada. Other spending is primarily in Republic of the Congo for continued development of the Azurite offshore field. Refining and marketing expenditures in 2010 should be about $400 million, or 17% of the Company total, including funds for construction of additional U.S. retail gasoline stations and final costs for an expansion of crude throughput capacity at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery. Capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during 2010 and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases, which often are not anticipated at the time the Budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2010 using operating cash flow, but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities. The Companys 2010 budget calls for no increase in long term debt during the year, but if oil and or natural gas prices weaken or refining and marketing margins remain weak actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced to such a level that borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Companys ongoing development projects. As noted earlier, North American natural gas prices in early 2010 were below the levels assumed in the 2010 budget. Also, through early 2010, margins within the Companys refining and marketing operations were significantly below amounts assumed in the Companys 2010 budget. The Company currently expects production in 2010 to average slightly more than 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A key assumption in projecting the level of 2010 Company production is the anticipated ramp up of natural gas production from fields at Tupper in Western Canada and Sarawak, offshore Malaysia, and ramp up of oil production from the Thunder Hawk field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Azurite field offshore Republic of the Congo. In addition, continued reliability of production at significant fields such as Kikeh, Syncrude, Hibernia and Terra Nova are necessary to achieve the anticipated 2010 production levels. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which express managements current views concerning future events or results, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the volatility and level of crude oil and natural gas prices, the level and success rate of our exploration programs, our ability to maintain production rates and replace reserves, political and regulatory instability, and uncontrollable natural hazards. For further discussion of risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, which begins on page 11 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Murphy undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. There were short term derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at December 31, 2009 to hedge the value of U.S. dollars against two foreign currencies. A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies would have reduced the recorded net asset associated with these contracts by approximately $8.7 million, while a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased the recorded net asset by approximately $5.2 million. Changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the financial statement impact of an equivalent volume of foreign currency exposures associated with other assets and or liabilities.
