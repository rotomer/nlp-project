Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in the United States and United Kingdom. A more detailed description of the Companys significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy generates revenue primarily by selling oil and natural gas production and refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the United States, Canada, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and other countries. The Companys revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells. Also, because crude oil is purchased by the Company for refinery feedstocks, natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil production facilities, and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the U.S. that are primarily located at Walmart Supercenters, the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the Companys costs. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration. Profits and generation of cash in the Companys refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins, which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing, transporting and marketing these products. Murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions. Worldwide oil and North American natural gas prices were higher in 2010 than in 2009, but these prices were significantly lower on average in 2009 than in 2008. The sales price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged $79.61 in 2010, $62.05 in 2009 and $98.90 in 2008. The NYMEX natural gas price per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) averaged $4.38 in 2010, $3.94 in 2009 and $8.89 in 2008. Crude oil prices generally strengthened in 2010 as the worldwide economy began to show signs of recovery following the deep recession that began in 2008. WTI oil prices in 2010 averaged 28% higher than 2009. The year 2009 began with quite low demand for hydrocarbons and consequently very weak prices for oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices rose as 2009 progressed as the slow economic recovery began. Crude oil and North American natural gas prices fell precipitously with the economic decline in late 2008. Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company, especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately 68% of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis (one barrel of oil equals six thousand cubic feet of natural gas) by the Company in 2010. In 2011, the percentage of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to decline to about 61% due to start up of significant natural gas production in the first quarter 2011 at the Tupper West area in British Columbia. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas should weaken in 2010 or beyond, the Company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business. Such lower oil and gas prices could, but may not, have a favorable impact on the Companys refining and marketing operating profits. Results of Operations Murphy had net income in 2010 of $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share) compared to net income of $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) in 2009. The prior year included income from discontinued operations in Ecuador of $97.1 million ($0.50 per diluted share). Income from discontinued operations in 2009 primarily arose from a gain on disposal of all Ecuador assets in March 2009. Excluding Ecuador, income from continuing operations was $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share) in 2010 and $740.5 million ($3.85 per diluted share) in 2009. Income in 2010 rose for both the exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M) operations compared to the prior year. Earnings for the Companys E&P operations increased in 2010 primarily due to higher sales prices and sales volumes of crude oil and natural gas. The Companys R&M earnings were higher in 2010 primarily due to stronger margins on U.S. retail gasoline fuel sales. Earnings in 2010 were unfavorably affected compared to 2009 by higher net costs associated with Corporate activities that were not allocated to operating segments, with the higher costs primarily caused by an unfavorable variance for the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Net income in 2009 of $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) was well below net income in 2008 of $1.74 billion ($9.06 per diluted share). The large decline in 2009 net income in comparison to 2008 was attributable to lower earnings in both the E&P and R&M operations. Weaker oil and natural gas sales prices in 2009 were the primary reasons for lower earnings in the E&P business, while lower retail gasoline margins in the U.S. and weaker refining margins in the U.K. led 19 Table of Contents to the earnings decline for R&M. The net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was lower in 2009 than in 2008. Income from continuing operations, excluding results from Ecuador operations which are reported as discontinued operations, was $740.5 million ($3.85 per diluted share) in 2009 compared to $1.74 billion ($9.08 per diluted share) in 2008. Further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections. 2010 vs. 2009 Net income in 2010 was $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share) compared to $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) in 2009. The 2009 results included income from discontinued operations of $97.1 million ($0.50 per diluted share). The discontinued operations income was associated with Ecuador properties sold in March 2009 and primarily arose from an after tax gain on disposal of $103.6 million. Income from continuing operations in 2010 and 2009 were $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share) and $740.5 million ($3.85 per diluted share), respectively. The higher 2010 income from continuing operations compared to 2009 was caused by higher earnings in both the exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M) businesses, but these were partially offset by higher net costs for unallocated corporate activities. E&P income from continuing operations improved $115.1 million in 2010, primarily due to a $10.70 per barrel higher realized sales price for crude oil in the most recent year. The 2009 results were impacted by two unusual items. First, an after tax gain of $158.3 million in 2009 was derived from a recovery of certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico federal royalties paid in prior years. Second, an after tax charge of $58.4 million was recorded in 2009 associated with a required one time working interest redetermination at the Terra Nova field, offshore Eastern Canada. The 2010 E&P results were also favorably affected, but in less significant measures, by higher sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas and higher sales prices for natural gas. E&P was unfavorably affected in 2010 compared to the prior year by higher expenses for exploration, production, depreciation and administration. Income from R&M operations was $77.4 million more in 2010, with the improvement mostly attributable to slightly more than a $0.03 per gallon improvement in margins on sale of gasoline at U.S. retail marketing stations. This was partially offset by higher net losses in 2010 for U.K. R&M operations. The net costs of corporate activities were higher by $134.9 million in 2010, mostly attributable to unfavorable effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To a lesser degree, the 2010 corporate net costs were unfavorably affected by lower interest income and higher expenses for interest and administration. The unfavorable variance in foreign currency transactions in 2010 was primarily attributable to a strengthening of the Malaysian ringgit versus the U.S. dollar and weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the year. Sales and other operating revenues grew $4.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 mostly due to higher sales prices for gasoline and other motor fuels in the current year. Additionally, higher sales prices and sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas in the E&P segment contributed to the increase in 2010 revenue. Gain on sale of assets was $2.8 million less in 2010 than 2009 because the prior year included a $3.9 million gain on sale of a small Canadian natural gas field. Interest and other operating income (loss) declined by $147.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 mostly due to a $114.3 million unfavorable variance from the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies, plus nonrecurring interest income in 2009 of $42.0 million associated with a recovery of Federal royalties paid in prior years for production at certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. The expense associated with crude oil and product purchases increased by $3.6 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher average costs in the current year for crude oil feedstocks at the Companys three refineries and due to the higher costs of wholesale gasoline and other motor fuels which were purchased for resale at the Companys retail fueling stations in the U.S. and U.K. Operating expenses were $345.4 million higher in 2010 than 2009 due to a combination of higher oil and natural gas production costs, higher operating costs associated with the three oil refineries, and higher costs for U.S. retail gasoline station operations. Exploration expenses rose $27.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher geophysical costs in the Gulf of Mexico and Republic of the Congo, higher amortization expense for undeveloped leases in the Eagle Ford Shale, and higher administrative office and study costs in foreign locations. Exploration costs in 2010 included lower dry hole costs in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S., which more than offset higher dry hole costs in Republic of the Congo, Suriname and the U.K. Selling and general expenses were $36.9 million higher in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense rose $245.7 million in 2010 versus 2009 due to higher natural gas and crude oil sales volumes in 2010, higher E&P per unit depreciation rates, and higher R&M depreciation that included a new ethanol production facility, more U.S. retail gasoline stations and the crude unit expansion at the Milford Haven, Wales, refinery that was completed in 2010. Impairment of properties was nil in 2010 and $5.2 million in 2009, with the prior year costs related to write off of an underperforming natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Accretion of asset retirement obligations was $5.7 million more in 2010 than 2009 primarily due to higher discounted abandonment liabilities in the current year for wells drilled in Malaysia and for synthetic oil operations at Syncrude. Expense for redetermination of working interest at the Terra Nova field was $64.9 million less in 2010 than 20 Table of Contents 2009 because the prior year included cumulative costs for the period of December 2004 through 2009, while 2010 costs related only to current year volumes sold by the Company prior to the effective date of the final settlement. Interest expense was $0.2 million higher in 2010 primarily due to nine months of interest in the current year on nonrecourse debt associated with the Hankinson, North Dakota, ethanol production facility, compared to three months of interest on this debt in the prior year following the October 1, 2009 acquisition date. The nonrecourse debt was paid off by the Company in September 2010. The higher nonrecourse debt interest was mostly offset by lower interest expense on outstanding general bank financing balances in 2010. Capitalized interest was $10.2 million less in 2010 than in the prior year due to interest amounts allocated to the Sarawak natural gas development in 2009 prior to start up of operations later that year, partially offset by higher interest allocated to the Tupper West gas development in 2010. Income tax expense in 2010 was $79.5 million more than 2009 due to higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher overall effective tax rate in the current year. The consolidated effective tax rate was 43.6% in 2010 compared to 42.0% in 2009, with the rate increase in the current year caused by a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 and due to higher current year exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses will be realized in 2010 or future years to reduce taxes owed. The tax rates in both 2010 and 2009 were higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state income taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the Companys uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in 2010 or future years. Income from discontinued operations was $97.1 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in 2009 mostly due to an after tax gain of $103.6 million on sale of Ecuador operations in March 2009. There was no income from discontinued operations in 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income in 2009 totaled $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) compared to $1.74 billion ($9.06 per diluted share) in 2008. Earnings included discontinued operations income of $97.1 million ($0.50 per diluted share) in 2009 compared to a loss of $4.8 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2008. Discontinued operations were associated with the Companys former operations in Ecuador which were sold in March 2009 for an after tax gain of $103.6 million. Income from continuing operations amounted to $740.5 million ($3.85 per diluted share) in 2009, down from $1.74 billion ($9.08 per diluted share) in 2008. The lower earnings in 2009 from continuing operations was attributable to lower income in the exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M) businesses. E&P income from continuing operations was $911.0 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily attributable to weaker realized sales prices for crude oil, which were down about $33.00 per barrel for the Companys production. Other unfavorable impacts in 2009 included a $58.4 million charge after taxes to effect an anticipated reduction in the Companys working interest in the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland, lower North American natural gas sales prices, gains on sale of Canadian assets in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009, and higher extraction costs for oil and gas produced in 2009. E&P results in 2009 benefited from higher volumes of oil and gas produced, lower exploration expenses and after tax income of $158.3 million from recovery of federal royalties paid between 2003 and 2009 on certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Income from R&M operations was $242.1 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008, essentially attributable to two factors weaker retail gasoline marketing margins in the U.S. and weaker refining margins in the U.K. The net cost of corporate activities was $148.8 million less in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to gains from transactions denominated in foreign currencies in 2009 compared to losses on such transactions in 2008. During 2009 the U.S. dollar generally weakened in comparison to the British pound sterling, which provided a favorable foreign currency impact to the Companys earnings. Additionally, 2009 benefited from higher interest income, including interest due to the Company through December 31, 2009 on the federal royalty refund, and lower net interest expense. Sales and operating revenues were $8.4 billion less in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to lower prices realized on gasoline and other fuels sold by the Company. Crude oil and natural gas sales prices were also lower in 2009 than 2008. But these lower prices were partially offset by income of $244.4 million in 2009 associated with a recovery of federal royalties previously paid by the Company on certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties. Gain on sale of assets classified in continuing operations was $130.0 million less in 2009 than 2008 principally due to significant gains on two assets sold in Canada in 2008 Berkana Energy and the Lloydminster properties. Interest and other income in 2009 was $152.5 million higher than 2008 due to a combination of more favorable income effects from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and interest income on the recovery of federal royalties. Crude oil and product purchases expense was $7.1 billion less in 2009 than 2008 due mostly to the lower cost of gasoline purchased for resale in the U.S. retail marketing operations. Operating expenses in 2009 were $35.6 million less than 2008 mostly due to lower natural gas and other power costs in 2009 at synthetic oil operations in Canada and at the Companys three refineries. Exploration expense in 2009 was $79.2 million below 2008 primarily due to less spending on geophysical data in the U.S., Canada and Malaysia, and less amortization expense for undeveloped lease costs in the Tupper area in Western Canada. Selling and general expenses rose $13.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a combination of higher costs for employee 21 Table of Contents compensation and professional services. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was up $251.8 million in 2009 mostly due to higher oil and natural gas production volumes and higher depreciation rates per barrel of oil equivalents produced, with the higher costs mostly caused by new fields that came on stream in 2009. Impairment of long lived assets of $5.2 million in 2009 was attributable to write off of the remaining net book value for one underperforming natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased $1.7 million in 2009 primarily due to future abandonment costs to be incurred on oil and gas wells drilled in Malaysia in 2009. A charge of $83.5 million was recorded in 2009 to reflect the estimated cash settlement to be paid on an anticipated reduction in the Companys working interest in the Terra Nova field from the present 12.0% to about 10.5% retroactive to approximately December 2004. This redetermination process at Terra Nova was essentially completed in 2010. Interest expense in 2009 was $20.6 million less than 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates charged on certain bank loans during 2009. Interest capitalized to oil and gas development projects in 2009 was $2.8 million below the 2008 level due to commencement of production at the Thunder Hawk and Azurite oil fields in the third quarter 2009. Income tax expense was $537.0 million less in 2009 than 2008 primarily due to lower pretax income in 2009. The effective tax rate on a consolidated basis increased from 38.1% in 2008 to 42.0% in 2009 due to a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in 2009 and due to higher exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses would be realized in 2009 or future years to reduce taxes owed. The tax rates in both 2009 and 2008 were higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state income taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceed the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the Companys uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in 2009 or future years. Income from discontinued operations was $101.9 million higher in 2009 than 2008 mostly due to an after tax gain of $103.6 million on sale of Ecuador operations in March 2009. Segment Results In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2010, are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Exploration and production continuing operations United States $ 72.7 178.0 156.6 Canada 213.8 64.8 588.7 Malaysia 659.4 561.9 865.3 United Kingdom 30.5 12.6 73.8 Republic of the Congo (77.2 ) (20.6 ) (1.1 ) Other (92.3 ) (104.9 ) (80.5 ) 806.9 691.8 1,602.8 Refining and marketing United States Manufacturing 28.4 31.2 (39.8 ) United States Marketing 155.4 61.0 267.7 United Kingdom (34.7 ) (20.5 ) 85.9 149.1 71.7 313.8 Corporate and other (157.9 ) (23.0 ) (171.8 ) Income from continuing operations 798.1 740.5 1,744.8 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 97.1 (4.8 ) Net income $ 798.1 837.6 1,740.0 Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production (E&P) continuing operations were $806.9 million in 2010, $691.8 million in 2009 and $1.60 billion in 2008. Income from E&P continuing operations in 2010 was $115.1 million more than in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales prices for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons produced by the Company. The Companys average realized sales price for crude oil, condensate and gas liquids in 2010 increased $10.70 per barrel over 2009. The Companys average natural gas sales prices in North American and Sarawak Malaysia were also higher in 2010 than 2009. E&P income in 2009 included a $158.3 million after tax one time benefit from recovery of previously paid federal royalties associated with certain fields in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Although both 2010 and 2009 had charges associated with a redetermination of working interest at the Terra Nova field offshore Eastern Canada, 2009 charges were higher by $64.9 million due to that year including estimated costs to settle the period from December 2004 to 2009, while 2010 included only costs for the current year. The one time redetermination process was essentially 22 Table of Contents completed in 2010 and reduced the Companys working interest at Terra Nova from the original 12.0% to 10.475%. Earnings in 2010 benefited from higher crude oil and natural sales volumes. Crude oil and liquids sales volumes increased 2% in 2010 while natural gas sales volumes rose 91%. The higher hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2010 led to higher expenses for production and depreciation of $225.0 million and $229.2 million, respectively. The 2010 year also had higher exploration expenses of $27.1 million compared to 2009, essentially due to higher expenses related to geophysical activities, undeveloped lease amortization and administration, which were somewhat offset by lower expenses for dry holes. Crude oil sales volumes increased in 2010 in the U.S. due to a full year of production at the Thunder Hawk field in the Gulf of Mexico; this field started producing in July 2009. Heavy oil sales volumes in Canada were lower in 2010 than 2009 due to lower gross production and a higher royalty rate in the Seal area of Western Canada. Sales volumes in 2010 offshore Canada were below 2009 levels mostly due to lower gross production at the Terra Nova field and a higher royalty rate at the Hibernia field. Synthetic oil sales at Syncrude increased in 2010 due to higher gross production compared to 2009. Sales volumes for crude oil produced in Malaysia were lower in 2010 due to less production at the Kikeh field offshore Sabah. Crude oil liquids sold in the U.K. rose in 2010 due to making up for undersold inventory barrels produced in 2009 at the Schiehallion field. Crude oil sales increased in 2010 in Republic of the Congo due to a full year of production at the Azurite field following production start up in August 2009. Natural gas sales volumes in 2010 increased significantly compared to the prior year due to a full year of production and higher daily sales volumes at gas fields which started up in 2009 offshore Sarawak Malaysia, as well as higher sales volumes at the Tupper area in Western Canada. E&P income from continuing operations in 2009 was $911.0 million less than in 2008 primarily due to significantly lower realized sales prices for the Companys crude oil production in 2009. The 2009 period was also unfavorably affected by several other factors, including lower North American natural gas sales prices, higher production and depreciation expenses, a $58.4 million after tax charge for an anticipated reduction of its working interest in the Terra Nova field, and higher gains on asset sales in 2008 compared to 2009. The 2009 year benefited from higher oil and natural gas sales volumes, lower exploration expense and after tax income of $158.3 million from recovery of previously paid federal royalties on production from certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico properties. Crude oil, condensate and gas liquids sales volumes from continuing operations were 8% higher in 2009 compared to 2008, compared to an increase in oil production volumes of 18% in 2009. Oil sales volumes did not rise as much as oil production volumes during 2009 primarily due to the timing of scheduling oil sales transactions at the Kikeh field offshore Malaysia. Sales volumes at Kikeh were below production levels in 2009 due to an increase in the volume of unsold barrels at the field at year end and a higher percentage of such unsold inventory barrels at the field being attributable to the Companys account. During 2008, Kikeh sales volumes exceeded production, which effectively reduced the Companys unsold inventory balance from year end 2007. Higher U.S. crude oil sales volume in 2009 was primarily attributable to a partial year of production at the Gulf of Mexico Thunder Hawk field, which started up in July 2009, and less downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for hurricanes. Lower crude oil sales volumes in Canada in 2009 were mostly attributable to the sale of the Lloydminster heavy oil field in early 2008 and production declines at the maturing Hibernia and Terra Nova fields. Lower crude oil sales volume in the U.K. in 2009 was primarily due to no sale at the Schiehallion field during the year, as damage to sales equipment at the production facility caused the scheduled oil sale in December 2009 to be deferred until 2010. Crude oil sales volumes at Kikeh in 2009 rose compared to 2008 due to higher annual production. Natural gas sales volumes increased 237% in 2009 and the improvement was partially attributable to higher gas volumes produced during 2009 in the Gulf of Mexico, the Tupper area in Western Canada and at Kikeh, and partially due to new production at the Sarawak gas fields offshore Malaysia following start up in September 2009. The Companys realized crude oil sales prices averaged 37% less in 2009 than 2008 and North American natural gas sales prices averaged 63% below 2008 levels. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 49 and F 50 of this Form 10 K report. Average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 5 of the 2010 Annual Report. 23 Table of Contents A summary of oil and gas revenues, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 United States Oil and gas liquids $ 557.6 374.8 374.0 Natural gas 87.0 80.6 162.1 Canada Conventional oil and gas liquids 388.6 365.6 775.8 Synthetic oil 378.6 288.5 459.6 Natural gas 132.1 68.6 5.5 Malaysia Oil and gas liquids 1,531.1 1,478.4 1,985.6 Natural gas 307.1 45.4 0.1 United Kingdom Oil and gas liquids 118.8 54.7 189.4 Natural gas 14.1 6.4 25.8 Republic of the Congo oil 156.7 24.5 Total oil and gas revenues $ 3,671.7 2,787.5 3,977.9 The Companys total crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations, which excludes discontinued operations in Ecuador sold in March 2009, averaged 126,927 barrels per day in 2010, 130,522 barrels per day in 2009 and 110,842 barrels per day in 2008. United States crude oil production averaged 20,114 barrels per day in 2010, up from 17,053 barrels per day in 2009. The U.S. increase was primarily attributable to a full year of oil production at the Thunder Hawk field that started up in July 2009 in the Gulf of Mexico. Heavy oil production in Western Canada declined from 6,813 barrels per day in 2009 to 5,988 barrels per day in 2010 due to a combination of lower gross production in the Seal area plus a higher royalty rate there due to higher sales prices in 2010. Crude oil production offshore Canada fell from 12,357 barrels per day in 2009 to 11,497 barrels per day in 2010 essentially due to lower production levels at Terra Nova caused by field decline and a higher royalty rate at Hibernia. Synthetic oil production of 13,273 barrels per day in 2010 exceeded 2009 volumes of 12,855 per day due to less downtime for maintenance in the current year. Crude oil and liquids production in Malaysia averaged 66,897 barrels per day in 2010, down from 76,322 barrels per day in 2009, with the decrease mainly due to downtime in the current year at Kikeh for well maintenance and installation of drilling equipment on the production facility. Crude oil production in the U.K. in 2010 was about flat with 2009 as higher production volumes at Schiehallion almost offset lower volumes due to well decline at Mungo/Monan. Oil production in Republic of the Congo rose to 5,820 barrels per day in 2010 after averaging 1,743 barrels per day for all of 2009; the Azurite field came on production in August 2009. Oil production in the U.S. increased from 10,668 barrels per day in 2008 to 17,053 barrels per day in 2009 with the increase mostly caused by start up of the Thunder Hawk field in July 2009 and higher production at the Medusa and Front Runner fields in 2009. Production of heavy oil in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin was 6,813 barrels per day in 2009, down from 8,484 barrels per day in 2008, primarily due to the sale of the Lloydminster property in early 2008 and due to decline at properties operated by a third party in the Seal area. Oil production offshore Canada fell from 16,826 barrels per day in 2008 to 12,357 barrels per day in 2009 due to field decline at Terra Nova and field decline and a higher net profit royalty rate at Hibernia. Synthetic oil operations at Syncrude had net production of 12,855 barrels per day in 2009, up from 12,546 barrels per day in 2008, with the increase caused by a lower royalty rate in 2009 due to sales prices significantly below those of the prior year. Oil production in Malaysia increased from 57,403 barrels per day in 2008 to 76,322 barrels per day in 2009, with the increase primarily due to higher production at the Kikeh field, which recorded peak production levels during 2009. Oil production in Malaysia was also favorably affected in 2009 by condensate produced at the Sarawak gas fields that started up in September 2009 and higher net oil production at the West Patricia field. A higher portion of production at West Patricia was allocated to the Companys account in 2009 as costs incurred for development of Sarawak gas fields increased the level of West Patricia oil used to recover costs under the production sharing contract for Blocks SK 309 and SK 311. Oil production in the U.K. was 3,361 barrels per day in 2009, down from 4,869 barrels per day in 2008, with the decline primarily due to more downtime at the Schiehallion field, mostly due to a damaged export hose that required production to be shut in for nearly all of the fourth quarter. The Azurite field offshore Republic of the Congo came on production in August 2009 and averaged 1,743 barrels per day for the full year of 2009. The Company sold its interest in Block 16 and other areas in Ecuador in March 2009 and has accounted for Ecuador as discontinued operations. Oil production in Ecuador, excluded from the totals for continuing operations, averaged 1,317 barrels per day in 2009 and 7,412 barrels per day in 2008. 24 Table of Contents Worldwide sales of natural gas were 356.8 million cubic feet (MMCF) per day in 2010, 187.3 MMCF per day in 2009 and 55.5 MMCF per day in 2008. Natural gas sales volumes in the U.S. were 53.0 MMCF per day in 2010, down from 2009 production of 54.2 MMCF per day as higher production at Thunder Hawk in the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford Shale area did not fully offset declines at fields onshore South Louisiana and at other fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas volumes in Western Canada increased from 54.9 MMCF per day in 2009 to 85.6 MMCF per day in 2010 essentially due to continued ramp up of Tupper area production during the just completed year. Natural gas sales volumes in Malaysia increased in 2010 for both the Sarawak and Sabah offshore areas. Sarawak production rose to 154.5 MMCF per day in 2010 following volumes of 28.1 MMCF per day in 2009. Sarawak gas production began in September 2009 and as such was on production for all of 2010 versus four months in 2009. The Company also continued ramp up of new wells at Sarawak gas fields during the current year. Gas sales at the Kikeh field averaged 58.2 MMCF per day in 2010, up from 46.6 MMCF per day the prior year. Natural gas sales volumes in the U.K. increased from 3.5 MMCF per day in 2009 to 5.5 MMCF per day in 2010 as gas volumes rose at both the Mungo/Monan and Amethyst fields during the current year. Natural gas production in the U.S. averaged 54.2 MMCF per day in 2009, compared to 45.8 MMCF per day in 2008. The higher volume in 2009 was primarily attributable to the Mondo NW field that reached peak production during 2009, start up of the Thunder Hawk field in July 2009 and less downtime in the Gulf of Mexico due to hurricanes. Natural gas production in Canada rose from 1.9 MMCF per day in 2008 to 54.9 MMCF per day in 2009 due to ramp up of Tupper area production in Western Canada. Tupper started up in December 2008. Natural gas production in Malaysia also rose significantly in 2009 as the Sarawak gas development started up in September 2009 and Kikeh gas production, which started up in December 2008, was onstream for a full year in 2009. Natural gas production during 2009 at Sarawak and Kikeh averaged 28.1 MMCF per day and 46.6 MMCF per day, respectively. Natural gas production in the U.K. fell from 6.4 MMCF per day in 2008 to 3.5 MMCF per day in 2009 primarily due to the Amethyst field being shut in for the first four months of 2009 for equipment repairs. The Companys average worldwide realized sales price for crude oil, condensate and gas liquids from continuing operations was $67.11 per barrel in 2010, $56.41 per barrel in 2009 and $89.16 per barrel in 2008. The average realized crude oil sales price increased 19% in 2010 compared to 2009. The higher price for 2010 was slightly below the 28% increase in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) sales prices between the years. Other benchmark oil prices used for sale of Company crude oil did not increase at the same rate as WTI. The increase in the sales price for APPI Tapis based crude oil during 2010 did not keep pace with the increase in the WTI price due to differences in market conditions in Asia versus the U.S. During most of 2010, the Company sold its Kikeh crude oil based on the APPI Tapis benchmark price. In late 2010, the Company began to sell its Kikeh crude oil based on a Brent crude oil benchmark. Compared to 2009, the Companys average 2010 crude oil sales prices rose 27% in the U.S. to average $76.31 per barrel; heavy oil sales prices in Canada rose 23% to an average of $49.89 per barrel; offshore Canada oil sold at $76.87 per barrel, an increase of 32%; Canadian synthetic crude oil sold for 27% more and averaged $77.90 per barrel; crude oil produced in Malaysia increased 10% to an average price of $60.97 per barrel; U.K. crude oil prices increased 27% to $77.95 per barrel; and crude oil sold in Republic of the Congo increased only 8% to $74.87 per barrel as the only sale in 2009 was near the end of the year when prices were above the 2009 average. The decline in the Companys average realized oil sales price of 37% in 2009 compared to 2008 matched the decline in the average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil during 2009. Crude oil prices began to weaken in late 2008 as the economic downturn worsened. Crude oil prices started 2009 at low levels due to a weakening worldwide demand for energy, but improved as the year progressed. Compared to 2008, the Companys average 2009 crude oil sales prices fell 37% in the U.S. to $60.08 per barrel; heavy oil prices in Canada fell 31% to $40.45 per barrel; offshore Canada oil was sold for 40% less and averaged $58.19 per barrel; synthetic crude oil sold for 39% less at $61.49 per barrel; crude oil in Malaysia was down 37% and averaged $55.51 per barrel; and U.K. crude oil production sold for 32% less at $61.31 per barrel. Virtually all natural gas prices showed improvements in 2010 compared to 2009. The prices for natural gas generally rose in the latest year in sympathy with the increase in average crude oil prices during the same period. The Companys average sales prices for natural gas in North America increased 22% to $4.34 per MCF in 2010. Natural gas produced offshore Sarawak sold for 31% more in 2010 than in 2009 and averaged $5.31 per MCF. Natural gas produced in the U.K. sold at an average of $7.01 per MCF in 2010, a 39% increase from 2009. 25 Table of Contents The Companys natural gas sales prices fell significantly in 2009 compared to 2008 as weaker demand for energy led to an oversupply of natural gas inventories. The Companys average realized North American natural gas sales prices were $3.57 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2009, a decline of 63% from the $9.54 per MCF realized in 2008. In the U.K. the average sales price fell from $10.98 per MCF in 2008 to $5.04 per MCF in 2009. Natural gas produced in 2009 offshore Sarawak was sold at an average price of $4.05 per MCF during the year. Based on 2010 sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1.00 per barrel and $0.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected 2010 earnings from exploration and production continuing operations by $30.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. Production expenses from continuing operations were $879.5 million in 2010, $654.5 million in 2009 and $611.5 million in 2008. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 49 and F 50 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table. (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2010 2009 2008 United States $ 12.46 10.62 10.01 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 8.45 9.44 9.44 Synthetic oil 42.61 36.64 41.08 Malaysia 9.31 8.00 10.31 United Kingdom 14.46 17.97 13.21 Republic of the Congo 31.30 43.51 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 10.51 9.21 10.24 Production expense per equivalent barrel in the U.S. increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a higher proportion of production in the later year coming from the higher cost Thunder Hawk field in the Gulf of Mexico. Cost per barrel for Canada conventional oil and gas operations, excluding synthetic oil, was lower in 2010 than 2009 due to a larger portion of total hydrocarbons produced coming from the Tupper gas area, but this was partially offset by higher unit costs for offshore operations at Hibernia and Terra Nova. The increase in production costs per barrel for synthetic oil operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was caused by higher maintenance and natural gas costs in the current year. Production expense in Malaysia rose in 2010 compared to 2009 as higher well maintenance and workover costs at Kikeh were only partially offset by a higher proportion of lower cost natural gas produced at fields offshore Sarawak. Production expense in 2010 in the U.K. on a per unit basis was lower than 2009 due to less repair costs at Schiehallion and higher natural gas production at Amethyst. Per unit production expense in 2010 in Republic of the Congo was less than in 2009 due to higher production levels associated with ramp up of the field, which came onstream in August 2009. Costs per barrel in the U.S. increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to start up of the Thunder Hawk field in July 2009. The per unit cost for Canadian conventional oil and gas operations was flat in 2009 compared to 2008 as the benefit of a full year of natural gas production at Tupper was offset by lower production volumes without a comparable reduction in costs at Hibernia and Terra Nova. Lower cost per barrel in 2009 compared to 2008 at Canadian synthetic oil operations was mostly caused by lower natural gas fuel costs. Production cost per unit in Malaysia was lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher oil production at Kikeh, and new natural gas production offshore Sarawak and higher natural gas production at Kikeh that collectively altered the production mix toward lower cost natural gas in 2009. Higher per barrel production expense in the U.K. in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower production levels at the Schiehallion and Amethyst fields, both of which were offline for repairs for a portion of 2009. 26 Table of Contents Exploration expenses from continuing operations for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 49 and F 50 on this Form 10 K report. Expenses other than leasehold amortization are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Dry holes $ 90.1 125.3 129.5 Geological and geophysical 65.1 40.5 85.2 Other 29.1 16.2 17.7 184.3 182.0 232.4 Undeveloped lease amortization 108.0 83.2 112.0 Total exploration expenses $ 292.3 265.2 344.4 Dry hole expense was $35.2 million lower in 2010 than in 2009 despite a 50% increase in spending for exploratory drilling. Dry hole expense in the U.S. was lower in the current year mostly due to deferral of planned Gulf of Mexico drilling due to the moratorium imposed by the Federal government following the April 2010 blowout and oil spill at the Macondo well owned by other companies. Malaysian operations had lower dry hole expense in 2010 due to more successful exploratory drilling results and favorable adjustments to final costs on prior year wells. Dry holes in the U.K. in 2010 primarily related to a decision to expense a well drilled in 2008 for which studies in 2010 indicated a lack of economical development options based on current pricing levels. Dry hole expense in Republic of the Congo was higher in 2010 than 2009 due to drilling more unsuccessful wells in the MPS block in the current year. Dry hole expense in 2010 in other foreign areas was less than in 2009 primarily due to an unsuccessful well offshore Australia in the prior year. Geological and geophysical (G&G) expenses were $24.6 million higher in 2010 than 2009. Areas of higher spending on seismic in the 2010 year included the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas, the MPN and MPS blocks offshore Republic of the Congo and offshore Malaysia. These higher G&G costs in 2010 were somewhat offset by lower spending in the Tupper area of Western Canada and offshore Suriname. Other exploration costs in 2010 were $12.9 million above 2009 levels primarily due to higher administrative costs for operations in Suriname, Indonesia and Australia in the current year. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose $24.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to higher amortization associated with lease acquisition costs in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas, partially offset by less amortization expense in 2010 following sanction of development at the Tupper West property in August 2009. Dry hole expense was $4.2 million lower in 2009 than 2008 due to more successful exploratory drilling results during a year with higher drilling capital expended. During 2009, lower dry hole costs in Malaysia and the U.S. was somewhat offset by higher costs in Australia and Republic of the Congo. G&G expenses were $44.7 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008. The reduction in G&G in 2009 was attributable to less spending on seismic in the Gulf of Mexico, the Tupper area in Western Canada, and offshore Sabah in Malaysia, but 2009 included higher spending for seismic covering the Semai II concession, offshore Indonesia. Other exploration costs were $1.5 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008 mostly due to less office costs allocable to Republic of the Congo exploration activities in the current year. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense was $28.8 million lower in 2009 compared to 2008 mostly due to lower amortization for Tupper and Tupper West area leases in Western Canada, but partially offset by higher amortization costs for Eagle Ford Shale leases in South Texas in 2009. An impairment charge of $5.2 million was recorded in 2009 to write off the remaining costs of a poorly performing natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for exploration and production continuing operations totaled $1,005.0 million in 2010, $775.8 million in 2009 and $527.8 million in 2008. The $229.2 million increase in 2010 was primarily caused by higher overall volumes of oil and natural gas sold during the current year. Additionally, a higher proportion of 2010 production was derived from fields brought onstream in recent years under a higher cost development environment. The $248.0 million increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to a combination of higher overall hydrocarbon production levels and start up of new fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Western Canada and Republic of the Congo that had higher per unit depreciation rates than older fields already on production. The exploration and production business recorded expenses of $31.1 million in 2010, $25.5 million in 2009 and $23.5 million in 2008 for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities. Because the abandonment liability is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment. The $5.6 million increase in accretion expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to additional wells drilled during the latest year in several geographical areas and higher estimated abandonment costs for offshore operations in Malaysia and synthetic oil operations in Western Canada. The $2.0 million increase in accretion costs in 2009 compared to 2008 was mostly attributable to additional wells drilled in 2009 at the Kikeh and Sarawak fields, offshore Malaysia. 27 Table of Contents The effective income tax rate for exploration and production continuing operations was 41.7% in 2010, 40.8% in 2009 and 37.4% in 2008. The effective tax rate was slightly higher in 2010 than 2009 mostly due to tax barrels owed the government of Republic of the Congo under the production sharing agreement covering the Azurite field. More tax barrels were owed the government due to higher Azurite production levels in 2010. The effective tax rate was higher in 2009 than 2008 due to both higher expenses in foreign tax jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be currently recognized due to lack of sufficient revenue to realize a current benefit and a higher percentage of profits in Malaysia where the effective tax rate of 38% is higher than the effective rates in the U.S. and Canada. The effective tax rates in all three years exceeded the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to higher overall foreign tax rates and exploration activities in areas where current tax benefits cannot be recorded by the Company. Tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include non revenue generating areas in Malaysia, Suriname, Australia and Indonesia. Each main exploration area in Malaysia is currently considered a distinct taxable entity and expenses in certain areas may not be used to offset revenues generated in other areas. No tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for Blocks H and P, offshore Sabah, and Blocks PM 311/312, offshore Peninsula Malaysia. At December 31, 2010, 10.8 million barrels of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 23.8 billion cubic feet of the U.S. proved natural gas reserves were undeveloped. More than 70% of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves (on a barrel of oil equivalent basis) are associated with the Companys various deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. Further drilling, facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed. In the Western Canadian Sedimentary basin, total proved undeveloped natural gas reserves totaled 116.8 billion cubic feet, with the migration of these reserves, primarily in the Tupper and Tupper West areas, dependent on both development drilling and completion of processing and transportation facilities. In Block K Malaysia, all oil reserves of 14.8 million barrels for the Kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling directed by another company. Additionally, the Kikeh field had undeveloped oil reserves of 15.8 million barrels, which are subject to further development drilling before being moved to developed. Also in Malaysia, there were 133.7 billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore Sarawak at year end 2010, which were held under this category pending completion of development drilling and facilities. On a worldwide basis, the Company spent approximately $1.27 billion in 2010, $1.34 billion in 2009 and $783 million in 2008 to develop proved reserves. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing (R&M) operations generated earnings of $149.1 million in 2010, $71.7 million in 2009 and $313.8 million in 2008. The R&M earnings improvement of $77.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was mostly attributable to more than a $0.03 per gallon improvement in retail fuel marketing sales margin in the U.S. and higher profits on merchandise sales at U.S. retail stations in 2010. The R&M earnings decline of $242.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 was driven primarily by significantly weaker margins in the U.S. retail fuel marketing business and lower refining margins in the U.K. The Company has announced its intention to sell its U.S. refineries and U.K. refining and marketing operations in 2011. The Companys R&M operations in the United States generated earnings of $183.8 million in 2010, $92.2 million in 2009 and $227.9 million in 2008. U.S. operations are further reported as segregated between manufacturing and marketing activities. U.S. manufacturing activities include two oil refineries and two ethanol production facilities, while U.S. marketing activities include retail and wholesale fuel marketing operations. U.S. manufacturing operations generated profits of $28.4 million in 2010 and $31.2 million in 2009, but incurred a loss of $39.8 million in 2008. The $2.8 million decline in manufacturing income in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily caused by nonrecurring income of $32.6 million in 2009 from insurance settlements at the Meraux, Louisiana, refinery. The insurance settlements related to property damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and damage caused by a refinery fire in 2003. Final insurance proceeds for Hurricane Katrina related property damage exceeded amounts originally estimated to be recovered. Manufacturing results in 2010 benefited from higher crude oil throughputs at both U.S. refineries, which occurred despite an approximate six week shutdown for a plant wide turnaround at the larger Meraux refinery. Overall refining margins per barrel at the Companys two U.S. refineries were lower, however, in 2010 than during the prior year. The Meraux refinery ran a slightly higher mix of more expensive sweet crudes in 2010 and the refinerys product yield of higher value gasoline and distillates in 2010 was slightly below 2009 levels. The 2010 manufacturing profit included higher earnings from the Companys ethanol production facility in Hankinson, North Dakota. The Hankinson plant, which was acquired on October 1, 2009, was in operation for the full year of 2010 compared to three months of operations in 2009. In late 2010, the Company acquired an unfinished ethanol production facility in Hereford, Texas. The Company expects to complete construction and start up the Hereford plant near the end of the first quarter 2011. 28 Table of Contents United States manufacturing results in 2009 were improved by $71.0 million compared to 2008 partially due to final insurance settlements in 2009 at the Meraux refinery for Hurricane Katrina related property damage and a related crude oil spill and damage caused by a 2003 fire. The insurance settlements provided pretax benefits of $32.6 million during 2009. Additionally, 2009 had slightly improved refining margins for the Companys Gulf Coast refinery and higher asphalt sales volumes and asphalt margins at the Superior, Wisconsin refinery. The Hankinson ethanol facility generated profitable operations in the fourth quarter 2009 due to the favorable spread between ethanol sales prices and corn prices. Unit margins (sales realization less costs of crude and other feedstocks, transportation to point of sale and refinery operating and depreciation expenses) for U.S. refining operations averaged $0.23 per barrel in 2010, compared to $0.75 per barrel in 2009 and $(1.48) per barrel in 2008. Meraux refinery throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks averaged 112,578 barrels per day in 2010, 109,725 barrels per day in 2009 and 103,169 barrels per day in 2008. Superior refinery throughput volumes averaged 34,641 barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks in 2010, compared to 32,280 barrels per day in 2009 and 26,770 barrels per day in 2008. The Meraux refinery underwent a full plant turnaround in early 2010, and both U.S. refineries were temporarily shut down for turnaround activities during 2008. Marketing operations in the U.S. generated earnings of $155.4 million in 2010, $61.0 million in 2009 and $267.7 million in 2008. Profits in 2010 exceeded 2009 due to more than a $0.03 per gallon improvement in margins on fuel sold in the Companys retail marketing system. Additionally, the Company had higher profits in 2010 on sale of merchandise in this business. Total fuel sales volumes per station at Company operated sites in the U.S. averaged about 306,600 gallons per month during 2010, down 1.9% from the prior year. United States marketing profits fell $206.7 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Fuel margins in the retail chain were hurt in 2009 by both lower demand for gasoline and diesel due to the weak economy and generally rising wholesale fuel costs caused by crude oil prices that rose gradually during the year. The large marketing profit in 2008 was caused by significant spreads between prices for wholesale and retail gasoline for a portion of that year. United States refined product sales volumes averaged 450,100 barrels per day in 2010, compared to 432,700 barrels per day in 2009 and 427,490 barrels per day in 2008. The increases in both 2010 and 2009 were mostly attributable to more finished products produced at the U.S. refineries compared to the prior year, plus in 2010 a full year of ethanol production from the Hankinson facility acquired in October 2009, compared to three months of ethanol production in 2009. The retail marketing business built 51 stations in 2010, following additions of 23 stations in 2009. The U.S. retail marketing network included 1,099 stations at year end 2010. United Kingdom R&M operations incurred a loss of $34.7 million in 2010 compared to a loss of $20.5 million in 2009 and a profit of $85.9 million in 2008. The losses in 2010 and 2009 for U.K. R&M operations were primarily due to weak margins at the Companys Milford Haven, Wales, refinery. Additionally, in 2010 the refinery underwent approximately a two month plant wide turnaround that reduced crude oil throughputs in the most recent year. The refining margin was hurt by weak demand for refined products in the U.K. and Western Europe during the two year period of 2009 and 2010. The soft demand led to an industry wide oversupply of gasoline and diesel products in the area. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $(1.47) per barrel in 2010, $(0.28) per barrel in 2009 and $3.41 per barrel in 2008. Overall refined product sales volumes in the U.K. averaged 86,657 barrels per day in 2010, down 16% compared to 2009, primarily due to downtime associated with the turnaround at the Milford Haven refinery in 2010. Sales volumes of refined products in the U.K. declined 7% to 103,774 barrels per day in 2009 compared to 2008, essentially due to lower production of finished products at the Companys Milford Haven, Wales refinery. Corporate The after tax costs of corporate activities, which include interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and unallocated corporate overhead, were $157.9 million in 2010, $23.0 million in 2009 and $171.8 million in 2008. The net cost of corporate activities rose $134.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The most significant variance related to the effects of foreign currency exchange, which was associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective operations predominant functional currency. The Company had after tax losses from foreign currency exchange of $58.1 million in 2010, while 2009 had after tax gains of $33.3 million. The foreign currency exchange loss in 2010 was primarily associated with a stronger Malaysian ringgit compared to the U.S. dollar. This led to costs associated with higher recorded future income tax liabilities, which are required to be paid in local currency. The Malaysian operations functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange losses were also experienced in the U.K. during 2010 caused by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the British pound sterling. This led to higher costs for U.S. dollar denominated liabilities owed by the Companys U.K. refining and marketing business, which has a sterling 29 Table of Contents functional currency. Additionally, 2009 benefited from interest income of $42.0 million associated with a recovery of Federal royalties previously paid on certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas production. Net interest expense, after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects, was $10.3 million higher in 2010 than 2009 mostly due to lower interest capitalized on oil and natural gas development projects during the just completed year. Corporate activities had higher administrative and depreciation expenses in 2010 than in 2009 of $14.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The increase in administrative expense in 2010 was primarily associated with higher employee compensation costs. Income taxes associated with corporate activities in 2010 were significantly favorable to 2009 due to higher net pretax costs in the later year. The net cost of corporate activities in 2009 was $148.8 million lower than in 2008, primarily due to more favorable effects of foreign currency exchange. Foreign currency exchange after taxes was a gain of $33.3 million in 2009 compared to a loss after taxes of $87.8 million in 2008. The U.S. dollar generally weakened against the British pound sterling in 2009 after having gained significant ground on the U.K. currency during 2008. The weaker dollar in 2009 reduced the cost of U.S. dollar based liabilities for the sterling functional U.K. R&M business. Foreign currency transaction effects in Canada, Malaysia and other foreign countries were generally insignificant for the full year 2009. The corporate area also benefited in 2009 from higher interest income of $10.9 million compared to 2008, principally due to $42.0 million ($27.0 million after taxes) of interest recognized on a recovery of U.S. federal royalties previously paid on certain production in the Gulf of Mexico. The interest on royalties more than offset lower interest income earned in 2009 on cash deposits and other longer term investments as these amounts attracted much lower interest rates during 2009 compared to the prior year. Net interest expense, after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects, was $17.8 million less in 2009 than 2008, principally due to lower interest rates charged on certain borrowings under the Companys credit facilities. Certain of these facilities charge interest based on a spread above LIBOR rates, which were held low in 2009 due to weakness in the overall economy. Administrative and depreciation expenses associated with corporate activities were both slightly higher in 2009 compared to 2008. Income tax expense in 2009 was significantly unfavorable to 2008 in the corporate area primarily due to the aforementioned favorable pretax variances for foreign exchange, interest income and net interest expense. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 18 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures, including exploration expenditures, were $2.45 billion in 2010 compared to $2.21 billion in 2009 and $2.36 billion in 2008. These amounts included capital expenditures of $0.8 million in 2009 and $6.9 million in 2008 related to discontinued operations in Ecuador. Capital expenditures included $184.3 million, $182.0 million and $232.4 million, respectively, in 2010, 2009 and 2008 for exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production continuing operations totaled $2.03 billion in 2010, $1.81 billion in 2009 and $1.93 billion in 2008, representing 83%, 82% and 82%, respectively, of the Companys total capital expenditures from continuing operations for these years. E&P capital expenditures in 2010 included $242.8 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, which primarily included leases acquired in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and in the Tupper West area in Western Canada, $470.0 million for exploration activities, $1.30 billion for development projects, and $22.0 million for acquisition of proved properties in Canada. Development expenditures included $524.7 million at the Tupper and Tupper West natural gas areas in Western Canada; $46.8 million for deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico; $166.8 million for the Kikeh field in Malaysia; $160.4 million for natural gas and other development activities in SK Blocks 309/311; $58.1 million for development of the Kakap field in Block K, offshore Malaysia; $63.2 million for synthetic oil operations at the Syncrude project in Canada; $84.9 million for Western Canada heavy oil projects; $126.5 million for development of the Azurite field in Republic of the Congo; and $21.2 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 48 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled $407.4 million in 2010, $375.9 million in 2009 and $426.2 million in 2008. These amounts represented 17%, 17% and 18% of capital expenditures from continuing operations of the Company in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Refining capital spending was $179.2 million in 2010 compared to $206.0 million in 2009 and $141.8 million in 2008. Refining spending in 2010 included costs to reduce benzene production and construct a new laboratory at Meraux; costs to meet compliance with ultra low sulfur diesel and Mobile Source Air Toxic requirements at Superior; and costs to complete an expansion to increase crude oil throughput capacity at Milford Haven to 135,000 barrels per day. Refining spending in 2009 mostly included projects at Meraux for benzene reduction, a distillate hydrotreater revamp and crude oil storage expansion; a sulfur recovery project at Superior; and an ongoing crude oil capacity expansion project at Milford Haven. Refining capital in 2008 included project costs for additional sulfur recovery capacity and property acquisition and improvements at the Meraux, Louisiana, refinery, and a cogeneration energy plant at the Milford Haven, Wales, refinery. Marketing expenditures amounted to $183.2 million in 2010, $78.5 30 Table of Contents million in 2009 and $284.4 million in 2008. Marketing capital expenditures in 2010 were primarily associated with building new retail fueling stations and acquiring land for new station sites in the U.S. Marketing capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily associated with new station builds and other improvements within the U.S. retail gasoline station network. Marketing capital spending in 2008 was split between station construction costs and land acquisitions costs for existing and future retail gasoline stations. The Company added 51 stations within its U.S. retail gasoline network in 2010, after adding 23 in 2009 and 52 in 2008. The Company spent $40.0 million in 2010 to acquire an unfinished ethanol production facility in Hereford, Texas. The Hereford facility is expected to be completed and in operation near the end of the 2011 first quarter. In 2009, the Company spent $92.0 million to acquire an ethanol production facility in Hankinson, North Dakota. The Hankinson ethanol plant was financed with an $82.0 million nonrecourse loan from the seller and a cash payment of $10.0 million. The nonrecourse loan was repaid in 2010. See Note D of the consolidated financial statements for further details about these acquisitions. Cash Flows Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $3.13 billion in 2010, $1.86 billion in 2009 and $3.04 billion in 2008. Cash provided by continuing operations in 2010 was $1.26 billion more than 2009 primarily due to a drawdown of working capital other than cash in the current year and higher income from continuing operations. The working capital reduction in 2010 included cash receipts of $286.4 million related to recovery of federal royalties and associated interest income. Income associated with the royalty recovery was recorded in 2009, but the cash proceeds were collected in early 2010. Cash provided by continuing operations in 2009 was $1.18 billion less than in 2008 primarily due to lower net income. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by expenditures for abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $36.5 million in 2010, $48.7 million in 2009 and $9.2 million in 2008. Investing activities Cash proceeds from property sales classified as continuing operations were $2.2 million in 2010, $1.6 million in 2009 and $362.0 million in 2008. The 2008 proceeds related to sales of two Canadian assets, including the Companys interests in Berkana Energy and the Lloydminster heavy oil property, plus a sale of 35% of its working interest in the MPS block offshore Republic of the Congo. During 2009, the Company generated cash of $78.9 million from the sale of its 20% working interest in Block 16 in Ecuador. Operating results and cash flows associated with Ecuador operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Property additions and dry hole costs used cash of $2.32 billion in 2010, $1.98 billion in 2009 and $2.18 billion in 2008. Cash used to pay for capital expenditures was higher in 2010 compared to 2009, but was lower in 2009 compared to 2008, with these variances essentially in line with changes in capital expenditures in each year. Cash of $2.39 billion, $2.53 billion and $1.04 billion was spent in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to acquire Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase. Proceeds from maturities of Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at date of acquisition were $2.55 billion in 2010, $2.17 billion in 2009 and $623.1 million in 2008. Cash of $98.9 million in 2010, $30.3 million in 2009 and $57.6 million in 2008 was used for turnarounds at refineries and Syncrude. The increase in 2010 was attributable to plant wide turnarounds for both the Meraux and Milford Haven refineries. Financing activities During 2010 and 2008, the Company used available cash flow to repay $414.0 million and $492.8 million, respectively, of debt. During 2009, the Company borrowed $243.5 million under debt agreements primarily to fund a portion of the Companys development capital expenditures. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans, including income tax benefits on stock options, amounted to $54.7 million in 2010, $16.9 million in 2009 and $50.0 million in 2008. In 2009, the Company paid $10.0 million to partially finance the acquisition of the Hankinson, North Dakota, ethanol plant; the remaining $82.0 million acquisition price was financed with a seller provided nonrecourse loan. This nonrecourse loan was fully repaid in 2010. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $201.4 million in 2010, $190.8 million in 2009 and $166.5 million in 2008. The Company raised its annualized dividend rate from $1.00 per share to $1.10 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2010. The Company had previously increased the annualized dividend rate from $0.75 per share to $1.00 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2008. Financial Condition Year end working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) totaled $619.8 million in 2010 and $1.19 billion in 2009. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying value for inventories under last in, first out accounting was $735.1 million below fair value at December 31, 2010. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 totaled $535.8 million compared to $301.1 million at year end 2009. 31 Table of Contents Long term debt, including nonrecourse loans, decreased by $413.8 million during 2010 and totaled $939.4 million at year end 2010, representing 10.3% of total capital employed. Long term debt decreased by $327.0 million in 2009. Stockholders equity was $8.20 billion at the end of 2010 compared to $7.35 billion a year ago and $6.28 billion at the end of 2008. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 6 of this Form 10 K report. Other significant changes in Murphys year end 2010 balance sheet compared to 2009 included a $162.4 million reduction in the balance of short term investments in Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase. The total investment in these Canadian government securities was $616.6 million at year end 2010 and $779.0 million at year end 2009. These slightly longer term investments were purchased in each year because of a tight supply of shorter term securities available for purchase in Canada. A $4.0 million increase in accounts receivable in 2010 was caused by higher sales prices and volumes for crude oil and finished products sold on credit terms by the Company, mostly offset by collection in 2010 of a receivable recorded in the prior year associated with recovery of previously paid federal royalties, plus interest thereon, totaling $286.4 million. Inventory values were $28.2 million more at year end 2010 than in 2009 mostly due to higher valued crude and refined products held in storage within downstream operations in the later year, but partially offset by less costs for unsold crude oil production held in inventory in the current year. Prepaid expenses increased $5.0 million in 2010 primarily due to higher prepaid income taxes in the U.K. Short term deferred income tax assets were $65.5 million higher at year end 2010 compared to 2009 due mostly to larger current temporary differences for expense deductions within downstream operations. Net property, plant and equipment increased by $1.30 billion in 2010 as a significant level of property additions during the year exceeded the additional depreciation and amortization expensed. Goodwill increased $2.2 million in 2010 due to a stronger Canadian dollar exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. Deferred charges and other assets decreased $3.1 million mostly due to reclassification of long term prepaid advances from this category to property, plant and equipment during 2010, but partially offset by higher turnaround costs spent and deferred in 2010 at the Meraux and Milford Haven refineries. Current maturities of long term debt at year end 2010 was essentially unchanged from 2009. Accounts payable increased by $698.4 million at year end 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher amounts owed for refinery crude oil purchases and for E&P drilling activities. Income taxes payable was $28.4 million lower at year end 2010 than at the end of 2009, primarily due to less U.S. income tax liabilities owed in the current year. Other taxes payable were $41.0 million higher mostly due to more value added taxes owed by the U.K. downstream operations at year end 2010 compared to 2009. Other accrued liabilities increased by $21.0 million in 2010 mostly due to a deposit received related to the pending sale of a natural gas storage asset in Spain and higher postemployment plan liabilities classified as a current liability at December 31, 2010. The current portion of deferred income tax liabilities increased $17.3 million in 2010 due to various short term temporary differences for tax deductions in Canada. Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities were $193.4 million higher at year end 2010 mostly due to accelerated tax depreciation associated with the Companys 2010 capital expenditures, primarily in Malaysia and Canada. The liability associated with future asset retirement obligations increased by $78.3 million mostly due to higher estimated future costs to retire assets in the Gulf of Mexico and at synthetic oil operations in Western Canada. Deferred credits and other liabilities were $16.1 million more in 2010 compared to 2009 mostly due to higher noncurrent liabilities associated with postemployment benefit plans in the current year. Murphy had commitments for future capital projects of approximately $1.30 billion at December 31, 2010, including $678.0 million for field development and future work commitments in Malaysia, and $118.3 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2010, the Company had access to a long term committed credit facility in the amount of $1.905 billion. A total of $340.0 million was borrowed under the committed credit facility at year end 2010. The most restrictive covenants under this committed credit facility limit the Companys long term debt to capital ratio (as defined in the agreements) to 60%. The committed credit facility expires in 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Company had uncommitted bank credit lines of approximately $430.0 million, but no borrowings were outstanding under these lines. The long term debt to capital ratio was approximately 10.3% at year end 2010. In September 2009, the Company filed a Form S 3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the offer and sale of debt and or equity securities. The Company may use this shelf registration, if needed, in future years to raise debt or equity capital to fund operational requirements. This shelf registration expires in September 2012. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note F to the consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that it may be able to repay a portion of its long term debt during 2011. This assumption is based on the anticipated sale of its three refineries and U.K. marketing assets during 2011, plus an ability to closely match its spending plans to cash inflows during the year. However, if the Company is unable to sell these downstream assets or if future oil and natural gas prices and or refining 32 Table of Contents and marketing margins weaken significantly, the Company may have to borrow under available credit facilities to fund ongoing development projects. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 18.0 to 1 in 2010, 16.7 to 1 in 2009 and 28.3 to 1 in 2008. Environmental Matters Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects our overall cost of business. Areas affected include capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities, in concert with ongoing operating costs for environmental compliance. Anticipated and existing regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings, and they may affect our competitive position to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that our competitors might not bear. Environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities, and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on our operations. Violation of federal or state environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and construction bans or delays. A discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject us to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result. Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and such capital expenditures were $139.3 million in 2010 and are projected to be $117.2 million in 2011. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting our U.S. operations are: The U.S. Clean Air Act, which regulates air emissions The U.S. Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges into U.S. waters The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes The U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States The U.S Safe Drinking Water Act, which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells Regulations of the U.S. Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations. These laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air, water and solid waste discharges. They also generally require permits for new or modified operations. Many states and foreign countries where the Company operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products, which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements. We are also subject to certain acts and regulations, including legal and administrative proceedings, governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations, which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines, underground storage tanks and general environmental operations. CERCLA commonly referred to as the Superfund Act, and comparable state statutes primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon Potentially Responsible Parties (PRP), without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released, disposed, or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLAs definition of a hazardous substance. We may be jointly and severally liable 33 Table of Contents under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment. CERCLA also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous and must be reported to the National Response Center, if they exceed an EPA established reportable quantity. The EPA currently considers us to be a PRP at one Superfund site. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at this site may be substantial. However, based on current negotiations and available information, we believe that we are a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at the Superfund site and as such, we have not recorded a liability for remedial costs. We could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at this site or other Superfund sites. We believe that our share of the ultimate costs to clean up this Superfund site will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on Murphys net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled. Although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. While some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation, investigation, and or cleanup, we are investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses, including state funding for remediation, and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on Murphys net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Although certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by us from other sources, no assurance can be given that future recoveries from these sources will occur. Therefore, we have not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of December 31, 2010. RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes. We generate non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. Our operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories: spent catalysts (usually hydrotreating catalysts); spent/used filter media; tank bottoms and API separator sludge; contaminated soils; laboratory and maintenance spent solvents; and industrial debris. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes. Such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses. We are also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in our operations. Under our accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. Under OPA90, owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such OPA90 claims made against Murphy. The EPA has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels, primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline, which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel is used. Several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels. The EPAs mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline became effective in 2008 and both of our U.S. refineries are capable of producing the required low sulfur gasoline. Each of the U.S. refineries are also capable of producing ultra 34 Table of Contents low sulfur diesel (ULSD) as required by the EPA beginning in 2010. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has issued requirements pursuant to the Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) regulation for the corporate annual average of benzene content in gasoline, which is not to exceed 0.62% by volume beginning January 1, 2011, with no individual facility to exceed 1.30% by July 2012. Equipment has been installed at the Meraux and Superior refineries to achieve MSTA compliance. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was signed into law in December 2007. The EISA, through EPA regulation, requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production. EISA greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) which began in September 2007. Murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to meet most of its obligation. On July 1, 2010, the RFS 2 standard came into effect requiring the blending/phase in of ethanol, biodiesel, cellulosic and advanced renewable fuels. Murphy is meeting its obligations for RFS 2 primarily through the RINs system. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA) imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The FWPCA imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. We maintain wastewater discharge permits for our facilities where required pursuant to the FWPCA and comparable state laws. We have also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws. We believe that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Our U.S. operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which we operate. Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act enacted in 1990 required most refining operations in the U.S. to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the EPA and state environmental agencies. Under the EPAs Clean Air Act authority, the National Petroleum Refinery (NPR) Initiative (Global Consent Decree) was used by the EPA to undertake at virtually all U.S. refineries an investigation of four marquee compliance areas, including: (i) New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration for fluidized catalytic cracking units, heaters and boilers; (ii) New Source Performance Standards for flares, sulfur recovery units, fuel gas combustion devices (including heaters and boilers); (iii) Leak Detection and Repair requirements; and (iv) Benzene National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Murphy began negotiations with the EPA in 2005, but was interrupted by the events of Hurricane Katrina. The states of Louisiana and Wisconsin are both parties to the NPR. Negotiations with EPA resumed in 2007 and were essentially completed in 2010. Under the Global Consent Decree, the Company agreed to pay a fine of $1.25 million and committed to capital improvements that are anticipated to cost approximately $142 million over the next eight years. Our Meraux, Louisiana, refinery is also currently negotiating with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regarding three Compliance Order/Notice of Proposed Penalty (CO/NOPP) notifications regarding air and water discharges. While we are in various stages of negotiations and or settlement, the Company has proposed a settlement offer related to these CO/NOPP negotiations and has reached agreement either independently with the State of Louisiana or as a condition of settlement of the federal Global Consent Decree, with approval of the State of Louisiana. The Company does not expect the settlement of this matter to have a material adverse effect on Companys net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. World leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. As part of these discussions, the Kyoto Agreement was adopted in 1997 and was ratified by certain countries in which we operate or may operate in the future, with the United States being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement. While efforts were made at the Copenhagen Accord, held December 19, 2009, to strengthen the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012, the delegates to the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) at Copenhagen agreed only to take note of the proceedings and did not ratify or agree to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. We are unable to predict how U.S. regulations (if any) associated with the Kyoto Agreement will impact costs in future years. The European Union has adopted an Emissions Trading Scheme in response to the Kyoto Agreement in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Our refining operations at Milford Haven currently have the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements. These environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred. 35 Table of Contents Currently, various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include a promulgated EPA regulation, Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases for numerous industrial business segments, including refineries and offshore production, which became effective December 29, 2009. These were followed by a more recent regulation requiring Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, including onshore exploration and production facilities, which became effective December 31, 2010. During 2010, U.S. federal legislation (Cap and Trade Legislation, EPAs Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, Low Carbon Fuel Standards, etc.) and various state actions were proposed to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which have or could impose mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The impact of existing and pending climate change legislation, regulations, international treaties and accords could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities; (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities; and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions trading program. These actions could also impact the consumption of refined products, thereby affecting our refinery operations. The physical impacts of climate change present potential risks for severe weather (floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.) at our Meraux, Louisiana, refinery in southern Louisiana and our offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Commensurate with this risk is the possibility of indirect financial and operational impacts to the Company from disruptions to the operations of major customers or suppliers caused by severe weather. The Company has repositioned itself to take advantage of potential climate change opportunities by acquiring renewable energy sources through the acquisition of two ethanol production facilities, thereby achieving a lower carbon footprint and an enhanced capability to meet governmental fuel standards. The Company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, or the cost impact of natural catastrophic events resulting from climate change, if it occurs, will be in future periods. The Company recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship as a core component of its mission as a responsible international energy company and has implemented sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to capture and process climate change related information. The Companys Environmental, Health, and Safety Committee, a standing committee of the Board of Directors, was created to oversee and monitor the Companys environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policies and practices. Further, in February 2009, our Board approved a worldwide environmental, health, and safety policy (the EHS Policy), which is available on the Companys Web site. In addition to requiring that the Company comply with all applicable EHS laws and regulations, the EHS Policy includes a directive that the Company will continue to minimize the impact of our operations, products and services on the environment by implementing economically feasible projects that promote energy efficiency and use natural resources effectively. We likewise apply this conscientious approach to the issue of climate change. As a companion to the EHS Policy, the Companys Web site also contains a statement on climate change. Not only does this statement on climate change include our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis while growing our upstream and certain downstream operations, the information on our Web site describes actions we have already taken to move towards that goal. While we are admittedly in the early stages of a process that will grow over time, the Company has formed an internal Climate Change Workgroup to address emerging climate change issues and improve energy efficiencies. This Climate Change Workgroup is working with the respective business units to focus on comprehensive climate change efforts aimed at preparing the company to succeed in a world challenged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These efforts include incorporating climate change into our planning processes, reducing our own emissions, pursuing new opportunities and engaging legislative and regulatory entities externally. In support of these efforts, worldwide greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted since 2001. The initiatives cited above demonstrate the Companys commitment regarding environmental issues, which are at the forefront of todays global public policy dialogue. Murphy is actively engaged in the legislative and regulatory process, both nationally and internationally, in response to climate change issues and to protect our competitive advantage. Additionally, Murphy participates in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. Safety Matters We are subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. 36 Table of Contents In 2007, OSHA announced a National Emphasis Program (NEP) for inspecting all refineries in the U.S. for compliance with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. OSHA conducted an inspection of our Meraux, Louisiana refinery from July September 2009, and on December 29, 2009, OSHA issued several compliance related citations and a proposed penalty. The matter was settled with OSHA through payment of a $63,000 penalty with all of the OSHA items abated in 2010, with concurrence from OSHA that the NEP event is now closed. Other Matters Oil Spill Response Plan Each Murphy offshore facility in the Gulf of Mexico has in place an Emergency Evacuation Plan (EEP) and an Oil Spill Response Plan (OSRP). In the event of an explosion, personnel would be evacuated immediately in accordance with the EEP and the OSRP would be activated if needed. In the event of an oil spill, the OSRP would be executed as needed. The EEP is approved by U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the OSRP is approved by Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (formerly the Minerals Management Service). The Company also has comprehensive emergency and spill response plans for offshore facilities in international waters. Murphys OSRP utilizes a consortium of seasoned and well equipped contract service companies to provide response equipment and personnel. One company has been contracted to provide spill containment and recovery equipment, including skimmers, boom, and vessels such as fast response boats and high volume open sea skimmer barges. This company has hired other companies to store and maintain response equipment and provide certified tanks and barges. Murphy is a founding member of Marine Preservation Association, which provides access to Marine Spill Response Corporation assets to support marine spills in the Gulf of Mexico and other offshore areas. Additionally, Murphy has an agreement with another company to provide aerial dispersant spraying services. We have further contracted with another company to utilize their equipment for oil containment should a well blowout occur. Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen (with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant at times) during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services when oil and gas prices were strong. As noted earlier, oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile over the last several years. Oil prices were very strong in early to mid 2008, then fell precipitously in late 2008 and into early 2009, then have generally strengthened since that time. The prices for oil field goods and services generally rise in periods of higher oil prices and do not usually decline as significantly as oil and gas prices in a lower price environment. Should oil prices continue to rise in future periods, the Company anticipates that prices for certain oil field equipment and services could rise sharply. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements The Company adopted new guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets effective January 1, 2010. This guidance makes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined previously no longer relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying special purpose entities must be reevaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance. This adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted, effective January 1, 2010, new guidance issued by the FASB that requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the entity or the right to receive potentially significant benefits from the entity. A company is required to make ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This guidance also amends previous guidance for determining whether an entity is considered a variable interest entity. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents In July 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that expands the disclosure requirements about financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses. This guidance became effective for the Company at December 31, 2010. Because the Company has no significant financing receivables that extend beyond one year, the impact of this guidance did not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statement disclosures. The Company adopted new accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements effective January 1, 2009. This guidance is applied prospectively, except for presentation and disclosure requirements which are applied retrospectively. This guidance required noncontrolling interests to be reclassified as equity, and consolidated net income and comprehensive income shall include the respective results attributable to noncontrolling interests. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted new accounting guidance covering business combinations effective January 1, 2009. The new guidance established principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business. It also established how to recognize and measure goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase, if applicable. This guidance impacts the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities in business combinations that occur beginning in 2009. Assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations that occurred prior to 2009 are not affected by this guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company is unable to predict how the application of this guidance will affect its financial statements in future periods. The Company adopted new accounting guidance which addressed disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in January 2009. This guidance expanded required disclosures regarding derivative instruments to include qualitative information about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. See Note L of this Form 10 K for further disclosures. In 2009, the Company adopted new accounting guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities. This guidance specified that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings per share (EPS) calculation under the two class method, and also required that all prior period EPS calculations be adjusted retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Companys prior period EPS calculations. The Company adopted new accounting guidance addressing certain equity method investment accounting considerations in January 2009. The guidance, which has been applied prospectively, addressed how to initially measure contingent consideration for an equity method investment, how to recognize other than temporary impairments of an equity method investment, and how an equity method investor is to account for a share issuance by an investee. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted new accounting guidance addressing subsequent events effective June 30, 2009. The guidance clarified the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date through the date of issuance of the applicable financial statements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The FASBs Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ended after September 15, 2009, and it recognized the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernment U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The codification superseded all existing accounting standards documents issued by the FASB, and established that all other accounting literature not included in the codification is considered nonauthoritative. Although the codification did not change U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, it did reorganize the principles into accounting topics using a consistent structure. The codification also included relevant U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance following the same topical structure. For periods ending after September 15, 2009, all references to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles use the new topical guidelines established with the codification. Otherwise, this new standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents The FASB has provided additional guidance regarding disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets, including how asset investment allocation decisions are made, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, and how fair value is determined for each major asset category. This guidance was effective for the Company as of December 31, 2009. Upon adoption, no comparative disclosures were required for earlier years presented. See Note K of this Form 10 K for additional disclosures. In December 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted revisions to oil and natural gas reserves reporting requirements which became effective for the Company at year end 2009. The primary changes to reserves reporting included: A revised definition of proved reserves, including the use of unweighted average oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year to compute such reserves, Expanding the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include non traditional and unconventional resources, which includes the Companys Canadian synthetic oil operations at Syncrude, Allowing companies to voluntarily disclose probable and possible reserves in SEC filings, Amending required proved reserve disclosures to include separate amounts for synthetic oil and gas, Expanded disclosures of proved undeveloped reserves, including discussion of such proved undeveloped reserves five years old or more, and Disclosure of the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the Companys overall reserve process. The Company utilized this new guidance at December 31, 2010 and 2009 to determine its proved reserves and to develop associated disclosures. The Company chose not to provide voluntary disclosures of probable and possible reserves in this Form 10 K. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that aligned its oil and gas reporting requirements and effective date with the SECs guidance described above. The United States Congress passed the Dodd Frank Act in 2010. Among other requirements, the law requires companies in the oil and gas industry to disclose payments made to the U.S. Federal and all foreign governments. The SEC was directed to develop the reporting requirements in accordance with the law. The SEC has issued preliminary guidance and is seeking feedback thereon from all interested parties. The preliminary rules indicated that payment disclosures would be required at a project level within the annual Form 10 K report beginning with the year ending December 31, 2012. The Company cannot predict the final disclosure requirements that will be required by the SEC. Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below. Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require that we use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining proved reserve quantities. These historical prices often do not approximate the 39 Table of Contents average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Companys depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. The Companys proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages F 46 and F 47 of this Form 10 K. The positive revision in U.S. proved oil reserves in 2010 was primarily associated with better than anticipated performance of wells at the Thunder Hawk and Medusa fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Better well performance at the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields led to favorable proved oil reserve revisions in Canada in 2010. Proved oil reserves for Canadian synthetic oil operations had a positive revision in 2010 primarily due to a lower royalty. The positive proved oil reserve revision in Malaysia in 2010 primarily related to better well performance at the Kikeh field. A positive proved oil reserve revision in Republic of the Congo in 2010 was attributable to improved terms under the production sharing agreement that allocated a larger share of production at the Azurite field to the account of the Company beginning in October 2010. A favorable oil reserve revision in 2009 in the United States was attributable to favorable performance of the Thunder Hawk and Front Runner fields and federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields. A favorable conventional oil revision in Canada in 2009 was caused by performance of the Terra Nova field and improved heavy oil pricing which added reserves in the Seal area. Due to changes in the SECs definition of proved oil reserves, which were first effective as of December 31, 2009, synthetic oil reserves are now included as proved oil reserves. Consequently, total synthetic oil reserves as of January 1, 2009 of 131.6 million barrels were added to total oil reserves in 2009. The positive revision to synthetic oil reserves during 2009 was attributable to lower royalties compared to a year ago. An unfavorable revision to oil reserves in Malaysia in 2009 was due to current year drilling results for a well in the Kikeh field, along with reduced entitlements at Kikeh and West Patricia due to increased prices at year end 2009 compared to year end 2008. Oil reserves in the U.K. reflected an unfavorable revision in 2009 because of an anticipated reduction in life expectancy for major equipment at the Schiehallion project. An unfavorable U.S. oil revision in 2008 resulted from updated reservoir modeling of one field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. An unfavorable revision in Canada in 2008 was related to low heavy oil prices at year end, but this was partially offset by a favorable impact from better field performance in 2008 at Hibernia. A favorable oil reserve revision in Malaysia in 2008 was attributable to better than anticipated drilling results and additional drilling opportunities in the main reservoir at the Kikeh field, coupled with better reservoir performance and artificial lift improvements at the West Patricia field. Proved natural gas reserves in the U.S. had positive revisions in 2010 due to better well performance at the Thunder Hawk and Mondo fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The positive gas reserve revision in Canada in 2010 was attributable to performance at various wells in the Tupper area of British Columbia. Proved reserves of natural gas in Malaysia were revised downward in 2010 due to higher prices leading to a lower future entitlement percentage for the Company. Positive gas reserve revisions in the U.K. in 2010 were attributable to better well performance at all gas producing fields. In 2009, a positive U.S. gas reserve revision was caused by favorable performance of the Thunder Hawk, Front Runner and Mondo NW fields as well as federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields. In Malaysia, a combination of increased entitlements due to pricing and drilling performance at the Sarawak gas project led to positive gas revisions in 2009. Gas reserves in the U.K. were favorably revised in 2009 because of the Amethyst field gas compression project and better Mungo field performance. An unfavorable natural gas reserve revision in Malaysia in 2008 was related to entitlement adjustments under the production sharing contract for Blocks SK 309 and SK 311 and gas volumes lost due to operational delays that restricted sales volumes at the Kikeh field, offshore Sabah. The Company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs, all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. 40 Table of Contents In some cases, a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves cannot be made immediately. This is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon(s) found. The determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is, in turn, usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves. Under current accounting rules, the Company holds well costs in Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked, dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred. In 2010, a dry hole was recorded for a well in the North Sea that was drilled in 2008. Extensive evaluations of this oil discovery determined in 2010 that recovery of hydrocarbons was not economical in the current price environment. There were no dry holes in 2009 or 2008 that were drilled in prior years. Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital and abandonment costs, future margins on refined products produced and sold, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable reserve revisions, expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a propertys carrying value for possible impairment. In making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment, the Company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices, future production volumes, and future capital and operating costs. Due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the Companys projections. Estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available. The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. In assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets, the Company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events, which include projections of future margins, future capital expenditures and future operating expenses. Future marketing or operating decisions, such as closing or selling certain assets, and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the Companys conclusion about potential asset impairment. Impairment expense of $5.2 million was recorded in 2009 to write off the remaining carrying value of one underperforming natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end 2010, the Company does not believe it had any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date. The expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods. These quoted prices often reflect higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the time of assessment. If quoted prices for future years had been lower, the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in 2010. In addition, one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices, lower future production, higher future costs, lower future margins on refining and marketing sales, or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods. Based on these unknown future factors as described herein, the Company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future. 41 Table of Contents Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property, equipment and inventories, and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for Blocks H, P and PM 311/312 in Malaysia and Blocks MPS and MPN in Republic of the Congo, for exploration licenses in certain areas, the largest of which are Australia and Suriname, and for certain basis differences in the U.K. due to managements belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs. Based on bond yields at year end 2010, the Company has used a discount rate of 5.66% at year end 2010 and beyond for the primary U.S. plans. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 6.50% for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations. The Companys normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 based on the effects of a growing employee base. In 2010, the Company paid $20.7 million into various retirement plans and $3.9 million into postretirement plans. In 2011, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $39.3 million into various retirement plans and $6.0 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected. As described above, the Companys retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5% decline in the discount rate would increase 2011 annual retirement and postretirement expenses by $6.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2011 retirement expense by $2.1 million. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company. 42 Table of Contents Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments, and other long term liabilities. In addition, the Company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period. Total payments due after 2010 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below. Amount of Obligation (Millions of dollars) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Total debt including current maturities $ 939.4 689.9 0.1 249.4 Operating leases 983.9 166.0 288.7 239.6 289.6 Purchase obligations 1,944.5 1,341.7 440.8 57.4 104.6 Other long term liabilities 698.6 42.2 25.6 106.9 523.9 Total $ 4,566.4 1,549.9 1,445.0 404.0 1,167.5 The Company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields. In addition, the Company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section. The Companys share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above. In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amount of commitments as of December 31, 2010 that expire in future periods is shown below. Amount of Commitment (Millions of dollars) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Financial guarantees $ 7.8 3.8 4.0 Letters of credit 223.4 219.6 3.8 Total $ 231.2 219.6 3.8 7.8 Material off balance sheet arrangements The Company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes. The most significant of these arrangements at year end 2010 includes operating leases of floating, production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSO) for the Kikeh and Azurite oil fields, operating leases for production facilities at the Thunder Hawk and West Patricia fields, a natural gas transportation contract for the Tupper area in Western Canada and a hydrogen purchase contract for the Meraux refinery. The leases call for future monthly net lease payments through 2015 at Kikeh, through 2016 at Azurite, through 2014 at Thunder Hawk and through 2012 at West Patricia. The Tupper transportation contract requires minimum monthly payments through 2018. The Meraux refinery contract to purchase hydrogen ends in 2021. The hydrogen contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased. Future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above. Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. The price for crude oil is primarily attributable to the level of demand for energy. In January 2011, West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded in a band between $86 and $92 per barrel. NYMEX natural gas traded in a band of $4.30 to $4.70 per MMBTU during this same time. U.S. refining margins in January 2011 were somewhat stronger than in late 2010, but U.S. retail marketing margins were squeezed by higher wholesale fuel costs during this period. The Company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending based on these prices. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2011 was prepared during the fall of 2010 and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to be slightly higher than 2010 levels. Since the budget was approved by the Companys Board of Directors, crude oil prices have generally been above the levels assumed in the 2011 budget, but North American natural gas prices have generally trailed the budgeted prices. Based on a recent review of capital expenditure projects, capital expenditures in 2011 are projected to total approximately $2.25 billion. Of this amount, $2.0 billion or about 88%, is allocated for the exploration and production program. Geographically, E&P capital is spread approximately as follows: 23% each for the United States and Malaysia, 39% for Canada and 15% for all other areas. Spending in the 43 Table of Contents U.S. is primarily associated with development and exploration programs in the Eagle Ford Shale. The Company believes that budgeted 2011 spending for exploration and development activities in the Gulf of Mexico is at risk due to the U.S. governments delay in permitting all such activities following the Macondo incident in 2010. In Malaysia, the majority of the spending is for continued development of natural gas fields in Blocks SK 309 and SK 311 offshore Sarawak and at the Kikeh and Kakap fields in Block K. Approximately one half of Canadian spending in 2011 will relate to natural gas development activities at the Tupper and Tupper West areas in Western Canada, with the remainder to be spent on continued development of existing oil fields. Other spending is primarily in Republic of the Congo for continued development of the Azurite offshore field and further exploration drilling in the MPS block. Refining and marketing expenditures in 2011 should be about $265 million, or 12% of the Company total, including funds for construction of additional U.S. retail gasoline stations. Capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during 2011 and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases, which often are not anticipated at the time the Budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2011 using operating cash flow, but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities. The Companys 2011 budget calls for a partial pay down of long term debt during the year, primarily based on the assumption that worldwide refining and U.K. marketing assets will be sold during 2011. If oil and or natural gas prices weaken or refining and U.K. marketing assets are not sold, actual cash flow generated from operations or asset dispositions could be reduced such that borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Companys ongoing development projects. The Company currently expects production in 2011 to average between 200,000 and 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A key assumption in projecting the level of 2011 Company production is the anticipated ramp up of natural gas production following a February 2011 start up at the Tupper West area in Western Canada. Other key assumptions include the timing of and ramp up of oil production from well workovers at the Kikeh field and well performance at the Azurite field offshore Republic of the Congo. In addition, continued reliability of production at significant operations such as Syncrude, Hibernia and Terra Nova and the continued demand for natural gas from our offshore Malaysia fields are necessary to achieve the anticipated 2011 production levels. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which express managements current views concerning future events or results, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the volatility and level of crude oil and natural gas prices, the level and success rate of our exploration programs, our ability to maintain production rates and replace reserves, customer demand for our products, political and regulatory instability, and uncontrollable natural hazards. For further discussion of risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, which begins on page 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Murphy undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. There were short term commodity derivative contracts in place at December 31, 2010 to hedge the value of about 0.1 million barrels of crude oil at the Companys refineries. Additionally, on this date the Company had open fixed price corn purchase commitments of approximately 7.0 million bushels of corn expected to be purchased and processed at the Companys ethanol production facility. The Company also had open derivative contracts at that date to sell 7.5 million bushels of corn at these fixed prices and buy it back at future prices in effect at the time the corn is actually purchased. A 10% increase in the respective benchmark price of these commodities would have reduced the recorded asset associated with these derivative contracts by approximately $1.6 million, while a 10% decrease would have increased the recorded asset by a similar amount. Changes in the fair value of the Companys derivative contracts generally offset the changes in the value for an equivalent volume of these feedstocks. There were short term derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at December 31, 2010 to hedge the value of U.S. dollars against two foreign currencies. A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies would have reduced the recorded net asset associated with these contracts by approximately $37.4 million, while a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have increased the recorded net asset by approximately $45.6 million. Changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the financial statement impact of an equivalent volume of foreign currency exposures associated with other assets and or liabilities.
