Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with petroleum marketing operations in the United States and refining and marketing operations in the United Kingdom. A more detailed description of the Companys significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10 K report. Murphy generates revenue by selling oil and natural gas production to customers in the United States, Canada, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and other countries. Additionally, the Company generates revenue by selling refined petroleum and ethanol products at hundreds of locations in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Companys revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells. Also, because crude oil is purchased by the Company for U.K. refinery feedstocks, natural gas is purchased for fuel at its U.K. refinery and at worldwide oil production facilities, and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the U.S. that are primarily located at Walmart Supercenters, the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the Companys costs. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration. Profits and generation of cash in the Companys refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins, which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing, transporting and marketing these products. Murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions and note holders. Worldwide oil prices were significantly higher in 2011 than 2010, but North American natural gas prices were weaker in 2011 than in the prior year. The sales price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $95.11 in 2011, $79.61 in 2010 and $62.05 in 2009. The NYMEX natural gas price per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) averaged $4.03 in 2011, $4.38 in 2010 and $3.94 in 2009. Crude oil prices rose in 2011 primarily due to a combination of recovering demand and unrest in the oil rich Middle East and Northern Africa. While the 2011 prices of WTI crude oil rose almost 20% compared to the prior year, crude oil sold based on other worldwide benchmark prices, such as Brent and Tapis, rose even more than WTI. The rise in prices of WTI based crude oil, which is only used as a benchmark in North America, was held back in 2011 compared to other worldwide benchmark price increases due to a somewhat temporary crude oil dislocation discount and a bit of supply/demand disparity in the continental U.S. during the year. The average price of NYMEX natural gas was 8% lower in 2011 than 2010. The disparity between crude oil and natural gas prices in North America continued to widen during 2011 compared to an energy equivalent basis of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil due to gas production growth that exceeded demand. The increase in natural gas production was primarily associated with volumes produced at a number of expanding U.S. unconventional shale gas plays. Natural gas prices in North America have declined further in early 2012 due to milder than normal winter temperatures across much of the U.S. Crude oil and North American natural gas prices were both higher in 2010 than in 2009. Crude oil prices generally strengthened in 2010 as the worldwide economy began to show signs of recovery following the deep recession that began in 2008. WTI oil prices in 2010 averaged 28% higher than 2009, while NYMEX natural gas prices increased 11%. Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company, especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately 57% of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis (one barrel of oil equals six thousand cubic feet of natural gas) by the Company in 2011. In 2012, the percentage of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to remain relatively consistent with 2011. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas should weaken in 2012 or beyond, the Company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business. Such lower oil and gas prices could, but may not, have a favorable impact on the Companys refining and marketing operating profits. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net income in 2011 of $872.7 million ($4.49 per diluted share) was 9% better than net income in 2010 of $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share). The improvement in 2011 net income in comparison to 2010 was primarily attributable to higher oil prices in 2011 and stronger U.S. retail marketing and refining margins. These were mostly offset by an impairment charge of $368.6 million in 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the Azurite oil field offshore Republic of the Congo to fair value. The net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was lower in 2011 than in 2010. Net income in 2011 included income from discontinued operations of $131.8 million ($0.68 per diluted share) compared to income from discontinued operations of $18.5 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in 2010. The results of discontinued operations in both years are associated with two U.S. refineries and certain associated marketing assets that were sold in 2011. Income from continuing operations was $740.9 million ($3.81 per diluted share) in 2011 compared to $779.6 million ($4.03 per diluted share) in 2010. Murphy had net income in 2010 of $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share), down 5% compared to net income of $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) in 2009. Net income in 2010 included income from discontinued operations of $18.5 million ($0.10 per diluted share), while 2009 had income from discontinued operations of $123.8 million ($0.64 per diluted share). The results of discontinued operations in 2010 were associated with operating income of the two U.S. refineries and associated marketing assets that were sold in 2011; income from discontinued operations in 2009 primarily arose from a $103.6 million after tax gain on disposal of all Ecuador assets in March 2009, but also included operating income of the U.S. refineries and marketing assets sold in 2011. Income from continuing operations was $779.6 million ($4.03 per diluted share) in 2010 and $713.8 million ($3.71 per diluted share) in 2009. Income in 2010 rose for both exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M) operations compared to the prior year. Earnings for the Companys E&P operations increased in 2010 primarily due to higher sales prices and sales volumes of crude oil and natural gas. The Companys R&M earnings from continuing operations were higher in 2010 primarily due to stronger profits on U.S. retail gasoline fuel and merchandise sales. Earnings in 2010 were unfavorably affected compared to 2009 by higher net costs associated with Corporate activities that were not allocated to operating segments, with the higher costs primarily caused by an unfavorable variance for the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections. 2011 vs. 2010 Net income in 2011 totaled $872.7 million ($4.49 per diluted share) compared to $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share) in 2010. These earnings included income from discontinued operations of $131.8 million ($0.68 per diluted share) in 2011 compared to income of $18.5 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in 2009. Discontinued operations in both years were associated with the Companys two U.S. refineries which were sold in 2011. Income from continuing operations amounted to $740.9 million ($3.81 per diluted share) in 2011, down from $779.6 million ($4.03 per diluted share) in 2010. The lower earnings from continuing operations in 2011 was primarily attributable to a $368.6 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the Azurite oil field, offshore Republic of the Congo, to fair value. Higher sales prices for worldwide crude oil and Sarawak natural gas production and higher U.S. retail marketing profits partially offset the impact of the Congo impairment. E&P income in 2011 was $181.2 million lower than 2010, primarily attributable to the $368.6 million impairment charge at the Azurite oil field in Republic of the Congo. Other unfavorable impacts in 2011 included higher dry hole costs compared to 2010, lower crude oil sales volumes, lower North American natural gas sales prices and higher extraction costs for oil and gas produced in 2011. E&P results in 2011 benefited from a 41% higher average sales prices for crude oil produced and a 34% higher sales prices for natural gas produced offshore Sarawak, Malaysia. Income from R&M continuing operations was $59.7 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010, essentially attributable to stronger U.S. retail gasoline marketing margins of more than $0.04 per gallon and larger profits on sales of merchandise in the U.S. retail marketing business. The net costs of corporate activities were $82.8 million less in 2011 than 2010 primarily due to gains from transactions 25 Table of Contents denominated in foreign currencies in 2011 compared to losses on such transactions in 2010. During 2011 the U.S. dollar generally strengthened in comparison to the Malaysian ringgit, which provided a favorable foreign currency impact to the Companys earnings due to fewer U.S. dollars being required to pay 2011 and future income taxes owed in the local currency. Sales and operating revenues were $7.5 billion more in 2011 than 2010 primarily due to higher prices realized on crude oil production and gasoline and other refined products sold by the Company. Gain on sale of assets classified in continuing operations was $21.8 million more in 2011 than 2010 principally due to a profit on sale of gas storage assets in Spain in the current year. Interest and other income (loss) in 2011 was favorable $90.5 million compared to 2010 principally due to improved income effects from transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company collected higher interest income on invested cash balances in 2011 primarily due to larger average invested balances during the year. Crude oil and product purchases expense was $6.5 billion more in 2011 than 2010 due to higher costs of crude oil feedstocks at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery, higher costs for gasoline purchased for resale in the U.S. retail marketing operations and an increase in volume of merchandise purchased for resale at U.S. retail gasoline stations. Operating expenses in 2011 were $314.8 million more than 2010 mostly due to higher costs associated with the Companys production of oil and natural gas in 2011, plus higher operating expenses at U.S. retail marketing stations, and higher power and other costs at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery. Exploration expense in 2011 was $197.6 million above 2010 primarily due to higher dry hole costs associated with unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities in Brunei, Indonesia, Canada and Suriname. Selling and general expenses rose $41.8 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a combination of higher costs for employee compensation and professional services. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was down $21.1 million in 2011 mostly due to fewer barrels of oil equivalent produced in 2011 compared to 2010. Impairment of long lived assets of $368.6 million in 2011 was attributable to a charge to reduce the net book value of the Azurite oil field to fair value. The charge was necessitated by a reduction of proved oil reserves at this field at year end 2011. Accretion of asset retirement obligations increased $5.8 million in 2011, primarily due to future abandonment costs to be incurred on oil and gas development wells drilled in the Eagle Ford Shale and Montney areas in 2011, and higher estimated abandonment costs for existing wells in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Malaysia and for synthetic oil operations at Syncrude in Western Canada. The income effect of the redetermination of the Companys working interest at the Terra Nova field, offshore Eastern Canada, was favorable $23.9 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The final settlement related to the redetermination was made in early 2011 at a net cost to the Company that was $5.4 million less than previously estimated. The benefit from this reduced settlement payment was recognized in 2011. The net cost of $18.6 million in 2010 related to the portion of Terra Novas operating results in 2010 that were estimated to be owed to other partners upon final settlement. Due to the redetermination process, the Companys working interest at Terra Nova was reduced from 12.0% to 10.475%. Interest expense in 2011 was $2.7 million more than 2010 primarily due to interest associated with tax reassessments in Canada in the most recent year. Interest capitalized to oil and gas development projects in 2011 was $3.3 million below 2010 due to cessation of interest capitalized upon commencement of production at the Tupper West area in Western Canada in the first quarter 2011. Income tax expense was $200.9 million more in 2011 than 2010 due to higher pretax income in 2011 plus higher exploration and impairment expenses in the year for which no tax benefit was recognizable by the Company. The effective tax rate on a consolidated basis increased from 43.9% in 2010 to 52.2% in 2011 due to a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in 2011 and due to higher exploration, impairment and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses would be realized in 2011 or future years to reduce taxes owed. The tax rates in both 2011 and 2010 were higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state income taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the Companys uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these expenses in 2011 or future years. Income from discontinued operations was $113.2 million higher in 2011 than 2010 due to stronger U.S. refining margins in 2011 prior to the sale of the refineries near the end of the third quarter of 2011. Additionally, 2011 discontinued operations included a pretax gain on sale of the two U.S. refineries of $18.7 million. 26 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Net income in 2010 was $798.1 million ($4.13 per diluted share) compared to $837.6 million ($4.35 per diluted share) in 2009. The 2010 and 2009 results included income from discontinued operations of $18.5 million ($0.10 per diluted share) and $123.8 million ($0.64 per diluted share), respectively. The discontinued operations income in 2010 included the operating results of the Meraux, Louisiana, and Superior, Wisconsin, refineries and associated marketing assets that were sold in 2011. The 2009 discontinued operations income included the operating results of these two refineries plus properties in Ecuador that were sold in March 2009 at an after tax gain of $103.6 million. Income from continuing operations in 2010 and 2009 were $779.6 million ($4.03 per diluted share) and $713.8 million ($3.71 per diluted share), respectively. The higher 2010 income from continuing operations compared to 2009 was caused by higher earnings in both the E&P and R&M businesses, but these were partially offset by higher net costs for unallocated corporate activities. E&P income from continuing operations improved $115.1 million in 2010, primarily due to a $10.70 per barrel higher realized sales price for crude oil in 2010. The 2009 results were impacted by two unusual items. First, an after tax gain of $158.3 million in 2009 was derived from a recovery of certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico federal royalties paid in prior years. Second, an after tax charge of $58.4 million was recorded in 2009 associated with a required one time working interest redetermination at the Terra Nova field, offshore Eastern Canada. The 2010 E&P results were also favorably affected, but in less significant measures, by higher sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas and higher sales prices for natural gas. E&P was unfavorably affected in 2010 compared to the prior year by higher expenses for exploration, production, depreciation and administration. Income from R&M continuing operations was $85.6 million more in 2010, with the improvement mostly attributable to slightly more than a $0.03 per gallon improvement in margins on sale of gasoline at U.S. retail marketing stations. This was partially offset by higher net losses in 2010 for U.K. R&M operations. The net costs of corporate activities were higher by $134.9 million in 2010, mostly attributable to unfavorable effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To a lesser degree, the 2010 corporate net costs were unfavorably affected by lower interest income and higher expenses for interest and administration. The unfavorable variance in foreign currency transactions in 2010 was primarily attributable to a strengthening of the Malaysian ringgit versus the U.S. dollar and weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during the year. Sales and other operating revenues grew $3.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 mostly due to higher sales prices for gasoline and other motor fuels in the later year. Additionally, higher sales prices and sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas in the E&P segment contributed to the increase in 2010 revenue. Gain on sale of assets was $2.8 million less in 2010 than 2009 because the earlier year included a $3.9 million gain on sale of a small Canadian natural gas field. Interest and other operating income (loss) was unfavorable by $147.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 mostly due to a $114.3 million unfavorable variance from the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies, plus nonrecurring interest income in 2009 of $42.0 million associated with a recovery of Federal royalties paid in prior years for production at certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. The expense associated with crude oil and product purchases increased by $2.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher average costs for wholesale gasoline and other motor fuels which were purchased for resale at the Companys retail fueling stations in the U.S. and U.K. and higher costs for crude oil feedstocks at the Companys U.K. refinery. Operating expenses were $327.9 million higher in 2010 than 2009 due to a combination of higher oil and natural gas production costs and higher costs for U.S. retail gasoline station operations. Exploration expenses rose $27.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher geophysical costs in the Gulf of Mexico and Republic of the Congo, higher amortization expense for undeveloped leases in the Eagle Ford Shale, and higher administrative office and study costs in foreign locations. Exploration costs in 2010 included lower dry hole costs in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S., which more than offset higher dry hole costs in Republic of the Congo, Suriname and the U.K. Selling and general expenses were $46.8 million more in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to higher employee compensation costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense rose $243.5 million in 2010 versus 2009 due to higher natural gas and crude oil sales volumes in 2010, higher E&P per unit depreciation rates, and higher R&M depreciation that included a new ethanol production facility, more U.S. retail gasoline stations in operation and a crude unit expansion at the Milford Haven, Wales, refinery that was completed in 2010. Impairment of properties was nil in 2010 and $5.2 million in 2009, with the earlier year costs related to write off of an underperforming natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Accretion of asset retirement 27 Table of Contents obligations was $5.7 million more in 2010 than 2009 primarily due to higher discounted abandonment liabilities in 2010 for wells drilled in Malaysia and for synthetic oil operations at Syncrude. Expense for redetermination of working interest at the Terra Nova field was $64.9 million less in 2010 than 2009 because the earlier year included cumulative costs for the period of December 2004 through 2009, while 2010 costs related only to that years operations at Terra Nova. Interest expense was $0.2 million higher in 2010 primarily due to nine months of interest in 2010 on nonrecourse debt associated with the Hankinson, North Dakota, ethanol production facility, compared to three months of interest on this debt in 2009 following the October 1, 2009 acquisition date. The nonrecourse debt was paid off by the Company in September 2010. The higher nonrecourse debt interest was mostly offset by lower interest expense on outstanding general bank financing balances in 2010. Capitalized interest was $10.2 million less in 2010 than in the prior year due to interest amounts allocated to the Sarawak natural gas development in 2009 prior to start up of operations later that year, partially offset by higher interest allocated to the Tupper West gas development in 2010. Income tax expense in 2010 was $87.6 million more than 2009 due to higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher overall effective tax rate in the later year. The consolidated effective tax rate was 43.9% in 2010 compared to 42.2% in 2009, with the rate increase in the later year caused by a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 and due to higher current year exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses will be realized in 2010 or future years to reduce taxes owed. The tax rates in both 2010 and 2009 were higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to a combination of U.S. state income taxes, certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the U.S. federal tax rate, and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the Companys uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in 2010 or future years. Income from discontinued operations was $18.5 million ($0.10 per diluted share) in 2010 and $123.8 million ($0.64 per diluted share) in 2009. Income from discontinued operations in both years included operating results for the two U.S. petroleum refineries sold in late 2011. Income from discontinued operations in 2009 included an after tax gain of $103.6 million on Ecuador assets which were sold in March 2009. Segment Results In the following table, the Companys results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2011, are presented by segment. More detailed reviews of operating results for the Companys exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table. (Millions of dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Exploration and production continuing operations United States $ 152.7 72.7 178.0 Canada 328.0 213.8 64.8 Malaysia 812.7 659.4 561.9 United Kingdom 11.5 30.5 12.6 Republic of the Congo (385.3 ) (77.2 ) (20.6 ) Other (293.9 ) (92.3 ) (104.9 ) 625.7 806.9 691.8 Refining and marketing continuing operations United States 223.6 165.3 65.5 United Kingdom (33.3 ) (34.7 ) (20.5 ) 190.3 130.6 45.0 Corporate and other (75.1 ) (157.9 ) (23.0 ) Income from continuing operations 740.9 779.6 713.8 Income from discontinued operations 131.8 18.5 123.8 Net income $ 872.7 798.1 837.6 28 Table of Contents Exploration and Production Earnings from exploration and production (E&P) continuing operations were $625.7 million in 2011, $806.9 million in 2010 and $691.8 million in 2009. E&P income in 2011 was $181.2 million less than in 2010 primarily due to a $368.6 million impairment charge in 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the Azurite oil field to fair value. The 2011 period also had higher exploration expense, lower crude oil sales volumes and lower North American natural gas sales prices. But the latest year benefited from higher oil and Sarawak natural gas sales prices and higher natural gas sales volumes. The Companys realized crude oil sales prices averaged $27.43 per barrel more in 2011 than 2010. North American natural gas sales prices in 2011 were $0.26 per MCF below 2010 levels, but natural gas sales prices from fields offshore Sarawak were higher in 2011 by $1.79 per MCF. Crude oil, condensate and gas liquids sales volumes were 22% lower in 2011 compared to 2010, compared to a decrease in oil production volumes of 19% in 2011. Oil sales volumes declined more than oil production volumes during 2011 primarily due to the timing of scheduling oil sales transactions at the Kikeh field offshore Malaysia. Sales volumes at Kikeh were below production levels in 2011 due to an increase in the volume of unsold barrels at the field at the latest year end, while in 2010, Kikeh sales volumes exceeded production, which effectively reduced the Companys unsold inventory balance from year end 2009. U.S. crude oil sales volumes were lower in 2011 than 2010 principally due to less production at the Thunder Hawk field in the Gulf of Mexico. Lower crude oil sales volumes in Canada in 2011 were mostly attributable to production issues and a lower Company working interest percentage in 2011 at the Terra Nova field, but this was partially offset by higher sales volumes at the Seal heavy oil field in Alberta. Crude oil sales volume in the U.K. in 2011 were below 2010 levels primarily due to lower oil volumes produced at the Schiehallion and Mungo/Monan fields during the later year. Crude oil sales volumes at Kikeh in 2011 fell compared to 2010 due to lower annual production in 2011 caused by well downtime for mechanical issues. Sales of crude oil and condensate increased at fields offshore Sarawak in 2011 due to higher volumes produced during the year. Crude oil sales volumes in Republic of the Congo fell in 2011 due to production decline at the Azurite field. Natural gas sales volumes increased 28% in 2011 and the improvement was primarily attributable to higher gas volumes produced during 2011 at the Tupper West area in Western Canada following start up in the first quarter of the year. Natural gas sales volumes also improved in 2011 at the Tupper area in Canada and at fields offshore Sarawak; both of these areas had active development programs during 2011. Natural gas sales volumes were lower during 2011 at the Kikeh field principally due to less volumes produced because of mechanical issues with wells. Income from E&P continuing operations in 2010 was $115.1 million more than in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales prices for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons produced in 2010. The Companys average realized sales price for crude oil, condensate and gas liquids in 2010 increased $10.70 per barrel over 2009. The Companys average natural gas sales prices in North America and Sarawak Malaysia were also higher in 2010 than 2009. E&P income in 2009 included a $158.3 million after tax one time benefit from recovery of previously paid federal royalties associated with certain fields in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Although both 2010 and 2009 had charges associated with a redetermination of working interest at the Terra Nova field offshore Eastern Canada, 2009 charges were higher by $64.9 million due to 2009 including estimated costs to settle the period from December 2004 to 2009, while 2010 included only costs for that years operating activities. Earnings in 2010 benefited from higher crude oil and natural sales volumes compared to 2009. Crude oil and liquids sales volumes increased 2% in 2010 while natural gas sales volumes rose 91%. The increase in hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2010 led to higher expenses for production and depreciation of $225.0 million and $229.2 million, respectively. The 2010 year also had higher exploration expenses of $27.1 million compared to 2009, essentially due to higher expenses related to geophysical activities, undeveloped lease amortization and administration, which were somewhat offset by lower expenses for dry holes. Crude oil sales volumes increased in 2010 in the U.S. due to a full year of production at the Thunder Hawk field in the Gulf of Mexico; this field started producing in July 2009. Heavy oil sales volumes in Canada in 2010 were less than 2009 due to lower gross production and a higher royalty rate in the Seal area of Western Canada. Oil sales volumes in 2010 offshore Canada were below 2009 levels mostly due to lower gross production at the Terra Nova field and a higher royalty rate at the Hibernia field. Synthetic oil sales at Syncrude increased in 2010 due to higher gross production compared to 2009. Sales volumes for crude oil produced in Malaysia were lower 29 Table of Contents in 2010 due to less production at the Kikeh field offshore Sabah. Crude oil sold in the U.K. rose in 2010 due to making up for undersold inventory barrels produced in 2009 at the Schiehallion field. Crude oil sales increased in 2010 in Republic of the Congo due to a full year of production at the Azurite field following production start up in August 2009. Natural gas sales volumes in 2010 increased significantly compared to the prior year due to a full year of production and higher daily sales volumes at gas fields which started up in 2009 offshore Sarawak Malaysia, as well as higher sales volumes at the Tupper area in Western Canada. The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages F 51 and F 52 of this Form 10 K report. Average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page 5 of the 2011 Annual Report. A summary of oil and gas revenues, including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, is presented in the following table. (Millions of dollars) 2011 2010 2009 United States Oil and gas liquids $ 648.8 557.6 374.8 Natural gas 71.1 87.0 80.6 Canada Conventional oil and gas liquids 505.6 388.6 365.6 Synthetic oil 506.6 378.6 288.5 Natural gas 280.2 132.1 68.6 Malaysia Oil and gas liquids 1,583.0 1,531.1 1,478.4 Natural gas 461.3 307.1 45.4 United Kingdom Oil and gas liquids 92.4 118.8 54.7 Natural gas 14.3 14.1 6.4 Republic of the Congo oil 148.8 156.7 24.5 Total oil and gas revenues $ 4,312.1 3,671.7 2,787.5 The Companys total crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations, which excludes discontinued operations in Ecuador sold in March 2009, averaged 103,160 barrels per day in 2011, 126,927 barrels per day in 2010 and 130,522 barrels per day in 2009. United States oil production decreased from 20,114 barrels per day in 2010 to 17,148 barrels per day in 2011 with the lower volumes mostly caused by field decline at Thunder Hawk that was primarily caused by a delay in development drilling operations in 2010 and 2011 following the Macondo incident in April 2010. The production decline at Thunder Hawk was partially offset by higher oil volumes produced in 2011 at the Eagle Ford Shale area in South Texas. Production of heavy oil in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin was 7,264 barrels per day in 2011, up from 5,988 barrels per day in 2010, primarily due to ongoing drilling operations at the Seal area in Alberta. Oil production offshore Canada fell from 11,497 barrels per day in 2010 to 9,204 barrels per day in 2011 primarily due to field decline at Terra Nova and a reduction of the Companys working interest at this field from 12.0% in 2010 to 10.475% in 2011. Synthetic oil operations at Syncrude had net production of 13,498 barrels per day in 2011, up from 13,273 barrels per day in 2010, with the increase caused by a lower royalty rate in 2011 due to higher costs incurred for the operations. Oil production in Malaysia decreased from 66,897 barrels per day in 2010 to 48,551 barrels per day in 2011, primarily due to lower production at the Kikeh field. Sands and other fines produced with the oil at Kikeh led to certain wells being down for a portion of 2011. Oil production in Malaysia was favorably affected in 2011 by higher condensate and other gas liquids produced at gas fields offshore Sarawak. Oil production in the U.K. was 2,423 barrels per day in 2011, down from 3,295 barrels per day in 2010, with the decline primarily due to more downtime at the Schiehallion and Mungo/Monan fields during 30 Table of Contents the later year. The Azurite field offshore Republic of the Congo averaged 4,989 barrels per day in 2011, down from 5,820 barrels per day in 2010 due to faster than expected well decline. United States crude oil production averaged 20,114 barrels per day in 2010, up from 17,053 barrels per day in 2009. The U.S. increase was primarily attributable to a full year of oil production at the Thunder Hawk field that started up in July 2009 in the Gulf of Mexico. Heavy oil production in Western Canada declined from 6,813 barrels per day in 2009 to 5,988 barrels per day in 2010 due to a combination of lower gross production in the Seal area plus a higher royalty rate there due to higher sales prices in 2010. Crude oil production offshore Canada fell from 12,357 barrels per day in 2009 to 11,497 barrels per day in 2010 essentially due to lower production levels at Terra Nova caused by field decline and a higher royalty rate at Hibernia. Synthetic oil production of 13,273 barrels per day in 2010 exceeded 2009 volumes of 12,855 per day due to less downtime for maintenance in the later year. Crude oil and liquids production in Malaysia averaged 66,897 barrels per day in 2010, down from 76,322 barrels per day in 2009, with the decrease mainly due to downtime in the later year at Kikeh for well maintenance and installation of drilling equipment on the production facility. Crude oil production in the U.K. in 2010 was about flat with 2009 as higher production volumes at Schiehallion almost offset lower volumes due to well decline at Mungo/Monan. Oil production in Republic of the Congo rose to 5,820 barrels per day in 2010 after averaging 1,743 barrels per day for all of 2009; the Azurite field came on production in August 2009. The Company sold its interest in Block 16 and other areas in Ecuador in March 2009 and has accounted for Ecuador as discontinued operations. Oil production in Ecuador, excluded from the totals for continuing operations, averaged 1,317 barrels per day in 2009. Worldwide sales of natural gas were 457.4 million cubic feet (MMCF) per day in 2011, 356.8 MMCF per day in 2010 and 187.3 MMCF per day in 2009. Natural gas production in the U.S. averaged 47.2 MMCF per day in 2011, compared to 53.0 MMCF per day in 2010. The lower volume in 2011 was primarily attributable to the Thunder Hawk field where production declined during the year due to delay in development drilling operations following the Macondo incident in April 2010. Natural gas production in Canada rose from 85.6 MMCF per day in 2010 to an annual Company record of 188.8 MMCF per day in 2011 primarily due to start up of production at the Tupper West area in Western Canada in the first quarter 2011. Gas sales volumes also increased in 2011 at the nearby Tupper area due to development drilling activities during the year. Natural gas production in Malaysia rose to 217.4 MMCF per day in 2011 compared to 212.7 MMCF per day in 2010. Natural gas sales volumes during 2011 at Sarawak and Kikeh averaged 176.9 MMCF per day and 40.5 MMCF per day, respectively. Gas sales rose 22.4 MMCF per day at Sarawak due to higher demand from the local purchaser, while Kikeh gas volumes fell 17.7 MMCF per day in 2011 due to lower demand and wells down for mechanical repairs for a portion of the year. Natural gas production in the U.K. fell from 5.5 MMCF per day in 2010 to 3.9 MMCF per day in 2011 primarily due to more downtime for repairs at the Amethyst field during the just completed year. Natural gas sales volumes in the U.S. were 53.0 MMCF per day in 2010, down from 2009 production of 54.2 MMCF per day as higher production at Thunder Hawk in the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford Shale area did not fully offset declines at fields onshore South Louisiana and at other fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas volumes in Western Canada increased from 54.9 MMCF per day in 2009 to 85.6 MMCF per day in 2010 essentially due to continued ramp up of Tupper area production during the later year. Natural gas sales volumes in Malaysia increased in 2010 for both the Sarawak and Sabah offshore areas. Sarawak production rose to 154.5 MMCF per day in 2010 following volumes of 28.1 MMCF per day in 2009. Sarawak gas production began in September 2009 and as such was on production for all of 2010 versus four months in 2009. The Company also continued ramp up of new wells at Sarawak gas fields during 2010. Gas sales at the Kikeh field averaged 58.2 MMCF per day in 2010, up from 46.6 MMCF per day the prior year. Natural gas sales volumes in the U.K. increased from 3.5 MMCF per day in 2009 to 5.5 MMCF per day in 2010 as gas volumes rose at both the Mungo/Monan and Amethyst fields during the later year. The Companys average worldwide realized sales price for crude oil, condensate and gas liquids from continuing operations was $94.54 per barrel in 2011 compared to $67.11 per barrel in 2010 and $56.41 per barrel in 2009. 31 Table of Contents The Companys average realized oil sales price of $94.54 in 2011 was an increase of 41% compared to 2010. The average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose 19% during 2011. The Companys average oil price increased more than WTI because other worldwide benchmark prices rose more than WTI during 2011. Dated Brent prices, for example, rose 40% during 2011. Additionally, the Companys realized sales price in Malaysia in 2011 and a portion of 2010 benefited from a switch to the Brent benchmark price during the prior year. Crude oil prices strengthened in 2011 due to an improvement in energy demand in association with a slowly recovering worldwide economy and unrest in Northern Africa and the Middle East during 2011 that caused concern in the oil markets about the potential for supply disruptions. Compared to 2010, the Companys average 2011 crude oil sales prices in the U.S. rose 36% to $103.92 per barrel; heavy oil prices in Canada sold for 14% more and averaged $57.00 per barrel; offshore Canada prices increased 43% to $110.02 per barrel; synthetic crude oil sold for 32% more at $102.94 per barrel; crude oil in Malaysia was up 48% and averaged $90.14 per barrel; U.K. crude oil production sold for 41% more at $110.13 per barrel; and crude oil in Republic of the Congo sold at $103.02 per barrel in 2011, an increase of 38% from 2010. The average realized crude oil sales price increased 19% in 2010 compared to 2009. The higher price for 2010 was slightly below the 28% increase in WTI sales price between the years. Other benchmark oil prices used for sale of Company crude oil did not increase at the same rate as WTI. The increase in the sales price for APPI Tapis based crude oil during 2010 did not keep pace with the increase in the WTI price due to differences in market conditions in Asia versus the U.S. During most of 2010, the Company sold its Kikeh crude oil based on the APPI Tapis benchmark price. In late 2010, the Company began to sell its Kikeh crude oil based on a Brent crude oil benchmark. Compared to 2009, the Companys average 2010 crude oil sales prices rose 27% in the U.S. to average $76.31 per barrel; heavy oil sales prices in Canada rose 23% to an average of $49.89 per barrel; offshore Canada oil sold at $76.87 per barrel, an increase of 32%; Canadian synthetic crude oil sold for 27% more and averaged $77.90 per barrel; crude oil produced in Malaysia increased 10% to an average price of $60.97 per barrel; U.K. crude oil prices increased 27% to $77.95 per barrel; and crude oil sold in Republic of the Congo increased only 8% to $74.87 per barrel as the only sale in 2009 was near the end of the year when prices were above the 2009 average. The Companys natural gas sales prices in North America in 2011 did not generally increase in concert with crude oil prices. A growing gas supply from unconventional sources such as shale operations kept gas prices in check during the latest year. The Companys average realized North American natural gas sales price was $4.08 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2011, a decline of 6% from the $4.34 per MCF realized in 2010. Natural gas produced in 2011 offshore Sarawak was sold at an average price of $7.10 per MCF, an increase of 34% from the $5.31 per MCF realized during 2010. In the U.K. the average sales price rose from $7.01 per MCF in 2010 to $9.99 per MCF in 2011, up 43% in the current year. Virtually all natural gas prices showed improvements in 2010 compared to 2009. The prices for natural gas generally rose in 2010 in sympathy with the increase in average crude oil prices during the same period. The Companys average sales prices for natural gas in North America increased 22% to $4.34 per MCF in 2010. Natural gas produced offshore Sarawak sold for 31% more in 2010 than in 2009 and averaged $5.31 per MCF in the later year. Natural gas produced in the U.K. sold at an average of $7.01 per MCF in 2010, a 39% increase from 2009. Based on 2011 sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates, each $1.00 per barrel and $0.10 per MCF fluctuation in prices would have affected 2011 earnings from exploration and production continuing operations by $23.5 million and $10.9 million, respectively. The effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the Companys refining and marketing segments could be affected differently. 32 Table of Contents Production expenses from continuing operations were $1,038.6 million in 2011, $879.5 million in 2010 and $654.5 million in 2009. These amounts are shown by major operating area on pages F 51 and F 52 of this Form 10 K report. Costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table. (Dollars per equivalent barrel) 2011 2010 2009 United States $ 18.05 12.46 10.62 Canada Excluding synthetic oil 8.65 8.45 9.44 Synthetic oil 47.91 42.61 36.64 Malaysia 13.66 9.31 8.00 United Kingdom 26.24 14.46 17.97 Republic of the Congo 26.04 31.30 43.51 Worldwide excluding synthetic oil 13.39 10.51 9.21 Production expense per equivalent barrel in the U.S. increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower volumes produced at the Thunder Hawk field and higher facility rental costs in the early days of the Eagle Ford Shale operation as production ramped up. The per unit cost for Canadian conventional oil and gas operations, excluding synthetic oil, was slightly higher in 2011 compared to 2010 as the benefit of significantly higher natural gas production at Tupper West and Tupper was more than offset by lower production volumes without a comparable reduction in costs at Hibernia and Terra Nova. Higher cost per barrel in 2011 compared to 2010 at Canadian synthetic oil operations was mostly caused by higher overall maintenance and fuel costs. Production cost per unit in Malaysia was higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily at Kikeh caused by higher costs for the work program to address equipment damaged by sand produced with the oil and the associated downtime which led to lower oil production. Higher per barrel production expense in the U.K. in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to lower production levels at all fields and extended maintenance work. Production expense in Republic of the Congo was lower on a per unit basis in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower gross costs incurred at the Azurite field in the later year. Production expense per equivalent barrel in the U.S. increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a larger proportion of production in the later year coming from the higher cost Thunder Hawk field in the Gulf of Mexico. Cost per barrel for Canada conventional oil and gas operations, excluding synthetic oil, was lower in 2010 than 2009 due to a larger portion of total hydrocarbons produced coming from the Tupper gas area, but this was partially offset by higher unit costs for offshore operations at Hibernia and Terra Nova. The increase in production costs per barrel for synthetic oil operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was caused by higher maintenance and natural gas costs in the current year. Production expense in Malaysia rose in 2010 compared to 2009 as higher well maintenance and workover costs at Kikeh were only partially offset by a higher proportion of lower cost natural gas produced at fields offshore Sarawak. Production expense in 2010 in the U.K. on a per unit basis was lower than 2009 due to less repair costs at Schiehallion and higher natural gas production at Amethyst. Per unit production expense in 2010 in Republic of the Congo was less than in 2009 due to higher production levels associated with ramp up of the Azurite field, which came onstream in August 2009. Exploration expenses from continuing operations for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table, and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages F 51 and F 52 on this Form 10 K report. Expenses other than leasehold amortization are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities. (Millions of dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Dry holes $ 251.0 90.1 125.3 Geological and geophysical 79.7 65.1 40.5 Other 41.0 29.1 16.2 371.7 184.3 182.0 Undeveloped lease amortization 118.2 108.0 83.2 Total exploration expenses $ 489.9 292.3 265.2 33 Table of Contents Dry hole expense was $160.9 million higher in 2011 than 2010 due to more unsuccessful exploratory drilling results in the current year, with the most significant areas including Brunei, Indonesia, Southern Alberta and Suriname. Lower dry hole costs in 2011 in Malaysia, Republic of the Congo and the U.K. somewhat offset the higher costs noted above. Geological and geophysical (G&G) expenses were $14.6 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in G&G expenses in 2011 was attributable to higher spending on seismic in Brunei, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Block H Malaysia and Cameroon, but the current year included lower seismic spending in Republic of the Congo. Other exploration costs were $11.9 million more in 2011 than 2010 mostly due to higher office costs allocable to exploration activities in Brunei, Indonesia and Iraq, and an exploration well drilling penalty in Southern Alberta. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense was $10.2 million higher in 2011 than 2010 mostly due to lease costs associated with concessions in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, but partially offset by slightly lower amortization costs in 2011 for Eagle Ford Shale leases in South Texas and the Montney area of Western Canada. Dry hole expense was $35.2 million lower in 2010 than in 2009 despite a 50% increase in spending for exploratory drilling. Dry hole expense in the U.S. was lower in 2010 mostly due to deferral of planned Gulf of Mexico drilling due to the moratorium imposed by the Federal government following the April 2010 blowout and oil spill at the Macondo well owned by other companies. Malaysian operations had lower dry hole expense in 2010 due to more successful exploratory drilling results and favorable adjustments to final costs on prior year wells. Dry holes in the U.K. in 2010 primarily related to a decision to expense a well drilled in 2008 for which studies in 2010 indicated a lack of economical development options based on current pricing levels. Dry hole expense in Republic of the Congo was higher in 2010 than 2009 due to drilling more unsuccessful wells in the MPS block in the later year. Dry hole expense in 2010 in other foreign areas was less than in 2009 primarily due to an unsuccessful well offshore Australia in 2009. G&G expenses were $24.6 million higher in 2010 than 2009. Areas of higher spending on seismic in the 2010 year included the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas, the MPN and MPS blocks offshore Republic of the Congo, and offshore Malaysia. These higher G&G costs in 2010 were somewhat offset by lower spending in the Tupper area of Western Canada and offshore Suriname. Other exploration costs in 2010 were $12.9 million above 2009 levels primarily due to higher administrative costs for operations in Suriname, Indonesia and Australia in 2010. Undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose $24.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to higher amortization associated with lease acquisition costs in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas, partially offset by less amortization expense in 2010 following sanction of development at the Tupper West property in August 2009. The Company recorded a $368.6 million impairment charge in 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the Azurite oil field, offshore Republic of the Congo, to fair value. The impairment charge at Azurite was necessitated by a reduction in the fields proved oil reserves at year end 2011 due to poor well performance. An impairment charge of $5.2 million was recorded in 2009 to write off the remaining costs of a poorly performing natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for exploration and production operations totaled $969.7 million in 2011, $1,005.0 million in 2010 and $775.8 million in 2009. The $35.3 million decrease in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to lower overall levels of hydrocarbon volumes sold, somewhat offset by a slightly higher per barrel depreciation rate based on a change in the mix of production between 2011 and 2010. The $229.2 million increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily caused by higher overall volumes of oil and natural gas sold during 2010. Additionally, a higher proportion of 2010 production was derived from fields brought onstream in recent years under a higher cost development environment. The exploration and production business recorded expenses of $36.8 million in 2011, $31.1 million in 2010 and $25.5 million in 2009 for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities. Because the abandonment liability is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value, accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment. The $5.7 million increase in accretion costs in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to a higher number of wells drilled in the current year in the Eagle Ford Shale and Montney areas and higher overall future estimated abandonment cost liabilities for Gulf of 34 Table of Contents Mexico wells and synthetic oil operations at Syncrude. The $5.6 million increase in accretion expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to additional wells drilled during the later year in several geographical areas and higher estimated abandonment costs for offshore operations in Malaysia and for Syncrude synthetic oil operations. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production continuing operations was 53.8% in 2011, 41.7% in 2010 and 40.8% in 2009. The effective tax rate was significantly higher in 2011 than 2010 due to no tax benefit recorded on the impairment charge for the Azurite field and higher exploration and administrative expenses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be currently recognized due to lack of sufficient revenue to realize a current or future benefit. Income tax expense in 2011 was reduced by a $25.6 million benefit for expenses incurred in prior years in Block P, Malaysia. It was determined during 2011 that these expenses in Block P are deductible against taxable income generated in Block K Malaysia. Also, in 2011, the U.K. government enacted a 12% supplemental tax on oil and gas company profits in that country. This tax increase raised the Companys tax expense in 2011 by $14.5 million, primarily to increase the recorded balance for deferred income taxes that will be paid in future years at the new higher rate. The effective tax rate is now 62% in the U.K. The overall effective income tax rate was slightly higher in 2010 than 2009 mostly due to tax barrels owed the government of Republic of the Congo under the production sharing agreement covering the Azurite field. More tax barrels were owed the government due to higher Azurite production levels in 2010. The effective tax rates in all three years exceeded the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% due to higher overall foreign tax rates and exploration and other expenses in areas where current tax benefits cannot be recorded by the Company. Tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include certain non revenue generating areas in Malaysia, Suriname, Australia, Indonesia, Brunei, Cameroon and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Each main exploration area in Malaysia is currently considered a distinct taxable entity and expenses in certain areas may not be used to offset revenues generated in other areas. No tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for Block H, offshore Sabah, and Blocks PM 311/312, offshore Peninsula Malaysia. At December 31, 2011, 34.5 million barrels of the Companys U.S. proved oil reserves and 40.2 billion cubic feet of U.S. proved natural gas reserves were undeveloped. More than 77% of the total U.S. undeveloped reserves (on a barrel of oil equivalent basis) are associated with the Companys Eagle Ford Shale operations in South Texas. Further drilling and facility construction are generally required to move the undeveloped reserves in the Eagle Ford Shale area to developed. In the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, total proved undeveloped natural gas reserves totaled 211.8 billion cubic feet, with the migration of these reserves, primarily in the Tupper and Tupper West areas, dependent on both development drilling and completion of processing and transportation facilities. In Block K Malaysia, all oil reserves of 14.7 million barrels for the Kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling directed by another company. Additionally, the Kikeh field had undeveloped oil reserves of 28.0 million barrels, which are subject to further development drilling before being moved to developed. Also in Malaysia, there were 98.3 billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore Sarawak at year end 2011, which were held under this category pending completion of development drilling and facilities. The deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Schiehallion field in the U.K. North Sea accounted for additional proved undeveloped reserves of 9.2 million and 17.4 million equivalent barrels of oil, respectively, at December 31, 2011. On a worldwide basis, the Company spent approximately $1.88 billion in 2011, $1.27 billion in 2010 and $1.34 billion in 2009 to develop proved reserves. Refining and Marketing The Companys refining and marketing (R&M) operations generated earnings from continuing operations of $190.3 million in 2011, $130.6 million in 2010 and $45.0 million in 2009. The R&M earnings improvement of $59.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 was mostly attributable to a $0.042 per gallon improvement in retail fuel marketing sales margin in the U.S. and higher profits on merchandise sales at U.S. retail stations in 2011. The R&M earnings increase of $85.6 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven primarily by a $0.03 per gallon improvement in sales margin for retail fuel, partially offset by lower refining margins in the U.K. in 2010 compared to the prior year. 35 Table of Contents The Company has announced its intention to divest its U.K. refining and marketing operations in 2012. The Meraux, Louisiana and Superior, Wisconsin refineries were sold in 2011 and are reported as discontinued operations. The Companys United States R&M operations generated earnings from continuing operations of $223.6 million in 2011, $165.3 million in 2010 and $65.5 million in 2009. U.S. R&M operations include two ethanol production facilities, along with retail and wholesale fuel marketing operations. The $58.3 million increase in U.S. income in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to more than a $0.04 per gallon improvement in retail fuel margin partially offset by a reduction in gallons sold. Additionally, the Company had higher profits in 2011 on the sale of merchandise in this business. Total fuel sales volumes per station at Company operated sites in the U.S. averaged about 277,700 gallons per month during 2011, down 9% from the prior year. U.S. profits in 2011 included higher income from the Companys ethanol production facilities compared to 2010. The Hankinson plant operated for both years while the Hereford plant was open for most of 2011 only. Corn costs were higher in 2011 compared to 2010, but this increase was essentially offset by higher sales prices for ethanol and by products, dried distillers grains and wet distillers grains, in the current year. United States R&M profits from continuing operations increased $99.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The 2010 increase was due to a $0.03 per gallon higher fuel margin compared to 2009 in the retail marketing business. The retail marketing business had slightly lower volumes sold in 2010 compared to 2009. Fuel margins in the retail chain were hurt in 2009 by both lower demand for gasoline and diesel due to the weak economy and generally rising wholesale fuel costs caused by crude oil prices that rose gradually during the year. United States refined product sales volumes (including discontinued operations) averaged 420,737 barrels per day in 2011, compared to 450,100 barrels per day in 2010 and 432,700 barrels per day in 2009. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to the sale of the two U.S. refineries near the end of September 2011, plus lower gasoline volumes sold through the U.S. retail marketing business. The sales volume increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was mostly attributable to more finished products produced at the U.S. refineries compared to the prior year. Additionally 2010 included a full year of ethanol production from the Hankinson facility acquired in October 2009, compared to only three months of ethanol production in 2009. The retail marketing business added 29 stations in 2011, 51 stations in 2010 and 23 stations in 2009. The U.S. retail marketing network included 1,128 stations at year end 2011. United Kingdom R&M operations incurred a loss of $33.3 million in 2011 compared to losses of $34.7 million in 2010 and $20.5 million in 2009. The loss in 2011 decreased from 2010 by $1.4 million, primarily caused by slightly better refining margins in 2011 and higher throughput volumes in 2011 due to a two month plant wide turnaround at the Milford Haven, Wales refinery in 2010. The loss in 2010 was higher than 2009 for U.K. R&M operations primarily due to weaker margins at the Milford Haven refinery and lower crude oil throughput caused by the refinery undergoing approximately a two month plant wide turnaround during 2010. U.K. refining margin was hurt by weak demand during the two year period of 2009 and 2010. Soft demand for refined products in the U.K. and Western Europe led to an industry wide oversupply of gasoline and diesel products in the area. Unit margins in the United Kingdom averaged $(0.67) per barrel in 2011, $(1.47) per barrel in 2010 and $(0.28) per barrel in 2009. Overall refined product sales volumes in the U.K. averaged 135,697 barrels per day in 2011, up 57% compared to 2010. The increase in sales volumes in 2011 was primarily due to downtime associated with a turnaround at the Milford Haven refinery in 2010. Sales volumes of refined products in the U.K. declined 16% to 86,657 barrels per day in 2010 compared to 2009, essentially due to the same refinery turnaround in 2010. Corporate The after tax costs of corporate activities, which include interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and unallocated corporate overhead, were $75.1 million in 2011, $157.9 million in 2010 and $23.0 million in 2009. The net cost of corporate activities in 2011 was $82.8 million lower than in 2010, primarily due to more favorable effects of foreign currency exchange, which was associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective operations predominant functional currency. The effect of foreign currency 36 Table of Contents exchange after taxes was a gain of $20.7 million in 2011 compared to a loss after taxes of $58.1 million in 2010. The U.S. dollar generally strengthened against the Malaysian ringgit in 2011 after having weakened against this currency during 2010. The stronger U.S. currency in 2011 reduced the dollar cost of tax liabilities in Malaysia which are payable in the local currency. The Malaysian operations functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction effects in the U.K. were also favorable in 2011 compared to the prior year. The corporate area also benefited in 2011 from higher interest income of $3.2 million compared to 2010, principally due to higher levels of invested cash earning interest during the current year. Net interest expense, after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects, was $6.0 million higher in 2011 than 2010. This unfavorable variance was principally due to interest charged on certain tax assessments in Canada and lower amounts of interest capitalized to development projects in the latest year, primarily at the Tupper West area development in Western Canada where gas production started up in the first quarter of 2011. Administrative expenses associated with corporate activities were also higher in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily associated with additional costs for compensation and professional services. The net cost of corporate activities rose $134.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The most significant variance related to the effects of foreign currency exchange. The Company had after tax losses from foreign currency exchange of $58.1 million in 2010, while 2009 had after tax gains of $33.3 million. The foreign currency exchange loss in 2010 was primarily associated with a stronger Malaysian ringgit compared to the U.S. dollar. This led to costs associated with higher recorded future income tax liabilities, which are required to be paid in local currency. Foreign currency exchange losses were also experienced in the U.K. during 2010 caused by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the British pound sterling. This led to higher costs for U.S. dollar denominated liabilities owed by the Companys U.K. refining and marketing business, which has a sterling functional currency. Additionally, 2009 benefited from interest income of $42.0 million associated with a recovery of Federal royalties previously paid on certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas production. Net interest expense, after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects, was $10.3 million higher in 2010 than 2009 mostly due to lower interest capitalized on oil and natural gas development projects during 2010. Corporate activities had higher administrative and depreciation expenses in 2010 than in 2009 of $14.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, compared to 2009. The increase in administrative expense in 2010 was primarily associated with higher employee compensation costs. Income taxes associated with corporate activities in 2010 were significantly favorable to 2009 due to higher net pretax costs in the later year. Discontinued Operations On September 30, 2011, the Company sold its Superior, Wisconsin refinery and related assets for $214 million, plus certain capital expenditures between July 25, 2011 and the date of closing and the fair value of all associated hydrocarbon inventories at these locations. On October 1, 2011, the Company sold its Meraux, Louisiana refinery and related assets for $325 million, plus the fair value of associated hydrocarbon inventories. The Company began to account for the Superior, Wisconsin and Meraux, Louisiana refineries and associated marketing assets as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter 2011. All prior years presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation of the Superior and Meraux operating results as discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations was $131.8 million in 2011, including operating profits of $113.1 million and an after tax gain on sale of the two U.S. refineries of $18.7 million. The after tax gain from disposal of the two refineries included a gain on the Superior refinery (including associated inventories) of $77.6 million and a loss on the Meraux refinery (including associated inventories) of $58.9 million. The net gain on disposal was based on the selling prices of the refineries, plus the sales of all associated inventories at fair value, which was significantly above the last in, first out carrying value of the inventories sold. Operating profits in 2011 of $113.1 million were significantly better than the 2010 operating profits of $18.5 million due to much stronger refining margins in 2011. Income from discontinued operations associated with the two U.S. refineries was a profit of $18.5 million in 2010 compared to income of $26.7 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 decline in results was primarily due to lower refining margins, and a nonrecurring income item in 2009 related to insurance settlements for Hurricane 37 Table of Contents Katrina. The 2010 results benefited from higher crude oil throughput volumes compared to 2009. The 2009 results from discontinued operations also included income from Ecuador properties of $97.1 million, which primarily arose from a gain on disposal of $103.6 million. Capital Expenditures As shown in the selected financial data on page 23 of this Form 10 K report, capital expenditures from continuing operations, including exploration expenditures, were $2.90 billion in 2011 compared to $2.33 billion in 2010 and $2.09 billion in 2009. These amounts excluded capital expenditures of $48.1 million in 2011, $117.3 million in 2010 and $113.3 million in 2009 related to discontinued operations, which was primarily associated with two U.S. petroleum refineries sold during 2011. Capital expenditures included $371.7 million, $184.3 million and $182.0 million, respectively, in 2011, 2010 and 2009 for exploration costs that were expensed. Capital expenditures for exploration and production continuing operations totaled $2.77 billion in 2011, $2.03 billion in 2010 and $1.81 billion in 2009, representing 96%, 87% and 86%, respectively, of the Companys total capital expenditures from continuing operations for these years. Capital expenditures in 2011 for the E&P business included $279.3 million for undeveloped lease acquisitions, $23.5 million associated with a contract revision at the Azurite field, $560.2 million of exploration activities and $1.91 billion for development programs. Lease acquisitions were primarily associated with activities in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and exploration concessions in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Exploration costs principally related to exploratory drilling at resource plays in North America, including the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and new areas in Southern Alberta, plus wildcat drilling activities in Brunei, Indonesia and Suriname. Development projects in 2011, primarily included spend of $572.2 million at the Tupper West and Tupper natural gas areas in Western Canada; $153.7 million for Seal heavy oil area activities; $339.6 million for the Kikeh field in Malaysia; $236.4 million for Sarawak SK Blocks 309/311 oil and gas projects offshore Malaysia; $115.7 million for the Kakap field in Block K, offshore Sabah Malaysia; $219.7 million for work in the Eagle Ford Shale; and $73.9 million for synthetic oil operations at Syncrude. E&P capital expenditures in 2010 included $242.8 million for acquisition of undeveloped leases, which primarily included leases acquired in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas and in the Tupper West area in Western Canada, $470.0 million for exploration activities, $1.30 billion for development projects, and $22.0 million for acquisition of proved properties in Canada. Development expenditures included $524.7 million at the Tupper and Tupper West areas; $46.8 million for deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico; $166.8 million for Kikeh; $160.4 million for natural gas and oil development activities in SK Blocks 309/311; $58.1 million for Kakap; $63.2 million for Syncrude; $84.9 million for Western Canada heavy oil projects; $126.5 million for development of the Azurite field in Republic of the Congo; and $21.2 million for the Terra Nova and Hibernia oil fields, offshore Newfoundland. Exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page F 50 of this Form 10 K report. Refining and marketing capital expenditures for continuing operations totaled $122.3 million in 2011, $290.1 million in 2010 and $263.4 million in 2009. These amounts represented 4%, 12% and 13% of capital expenditures of the Company in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total refining and marketing capital expenditures above excluded $48.1 million, $117.3 million and $112.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for U.S. refineries sold in 2011, which are now classified as discontinued activities. Refining capital spending for discontinued operations during the three years primarily included costs at Meraux to reduce benzene production, construct a new laboratory, revamp the distillate hydrotreater and expand crude oil storage capacity, and at Superior to meet compliance with ultra low sulfur diesel and Mobile Source Air Toxic requirements. Refining spend within continuing operations totaled $14.7 million in 2011, $59.8 million in 2010 and $94.9 million in 2009. These expenditures related to the Milford Haven, Wales refinery, and in 2011 principally included minor capital improvements, while the majority of 2010 and 2009 spend related to costs to expand crude oil throughput capacity at Milford Haven to 135,000 barrels per day. Marketing expenditures amounted to $84.9 million in 2011, $185.4 million in 2010 and $77.1 million in 2009. Marketing capital spending in 2011 was principally related to new station construction in the U.S. market. Marketing capital expenditures in 2010 were primarily associated with building new retail stations and acquiring land for new station sites in the U.S., while 38 Table of Contents marketing capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily associated with new station builds and other improvements within the U.S. retail gasoline station network. The Company added 29 stations within its U.S. retail gasoline network in 2011, after adding 51 in 2010 and 23 in 2009. Capital expenditures related to ethanol operations in the U.S. totaled $22.7 million in 2011, $44.9 million in 2010 and $91.4 million in 2009. The Company spent $40.0 million in 2010 to acquire an unfinished ethanol production facility in Hereford, Texas. Construction of the Hereford facility was completed at an added cost of about $25.1 million and the facility commenced operation near the end of the first quarter 2011. In 2009, the Company spent $92.0 million to acquire an ethanol production facility and inventory in Hankinson, North Dakota. The Hankinson ethanol plant was financed with an $82.0 million nonrecourse loan from the seller and a cash payment of $10.0 million. The nonrecourse loan was repaid in 2010. See Note D of the consolidated financial statements for further details about these acquisitions. Cash Flows Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $2.15 billion in 2011, $3.13 billion in 2010 and $1.86 billion in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities included cash from discontinued operations of $145.5 million in 2011, $100.5 million in 2010 and $94.4 million in 2009. Cash provided by continuing operations in 2011 was $1.03 billion less than 2010 primarily due to timing of cash collected and disbursed associated with changes in other working capital balances. Cash was primarily used to pay down accounts payable for crude oil feedstocks at formerly owned U.S. petroleum refineries and to pay income taxes in the U.S and Malaysia. Cash provided by continuing operations in 2010 was $1.26 billion more than 2009 primarily due to a drawdown of working capital other than cash in the current year and higher income from continuing operations. The working capital reduction in 2010 included cash receipts of $286.4 million related to recovery of federal royalties and associated interest income. Income associated with the royalty recovery was recorded in 2009, but the cash proceeds were collected in early 2010. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by expenditures for abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling $24.7 million in 2011, $36.5 million in 2010 and $48.7 million in 2009. Investing activities Cash proceeds from property sales classified as continuing operations were $27.8 million in 2011, $2.2 million in 2010 and $1.6 million in 2009. The 2011 proceeds primarily related to sale of gas storage assets in Spain. In 2011, the Company generated cash of $950.0 million from sale of two U.S. refineries and associated marketing assets, including liquid inventories. The U.S. refineries operating results and cash flow have been classified as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Other investing activities for discontinued operations included capital expenditures of $48.1 million in 2011, $117.3 million in 2010 and $113.3 million in 2009. Additionally, the two U.S. refineries which were sold used cash of $1.5 million in 2011, $37.5 million in 2010 and $10.2 million in 2009 for maintenance turnarounds. During 2009, the Company generated cash of $78.9 million from the sale of its 20% working interest in Block 16 in Ecuador. Operating results and cash flows associated with Ecuador operations have also been classified as discontinued operations. Property additions and dry hole costs for continuing operations used cash of $2.62 billion in 2011, $2.24 billion in 2010 and $1.88 billion in 2009. Cash used to pay for capital expenditures increased each year compared to the prior year, with these variances essentially in line with changes in capital expenditures in each year. Cash of $1.69 billion, $2.39 billion and $2.53 billion was spent in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to acquire Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase. Proceeds from maturities of Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at date of acquisition were $1.77 billion in 2011, $2.55 billion in 2010 and $2.17 billion in 2009. Cash of $5.4 million in 2011, $61.4 million in 2010 and $19.3 million in 2009 was used for turnarounds at the Milford Haven, Wales, refinery and Syncrude. The higher spend in 2010 was attributable to a plant wide turnaround at Milford Haven. Financing activities During 2011 and 2010, the Company used available cash flow to repay $340.0 million and $414.0 million, respectively, of debt. During 2009, the Company borrowed $243.5 million under debt agreements primarily to fund a portion of the Companys development capital expenditures. The debt reduction in 2011 was accomplished with proceeds from sale of the two U.S. refineries. In 2009, the Company paid $10.0 million to partially finance the acquisition of the Hankinson, North Dakota, ethanol plant; the remaining $82.0 million acquisition price was financed with a seller provided nonrecourse loan. This nonrecourse loan was fully 39 Table of Contents repaid in 2010. Cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans, including income tax benefits on stock options, amounted to $20.4 million in 2011, $54.7 million in 2010 and $16.9 million in 2009. In 2011, the Company used cash of $7.9 million for fees and other expenses associated with renewing its primary $1.5 billion committed credit facility that expires in June 2016. Also, in 2011 and 2010, cash of $8.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively, was used to pay statutory withholding taxes on stock based incentive awards that vested with a net of tax payout. Cash used for dividends to stockholders was $212.8 million in 2011, $201.4 million in 2010 and $190.8 million in 2009. The Company maintained its $1.10 per share annualized dividend rate in 2011. It had previously raised its annualized dividend rate from $1.00 per share to $1.10 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2010. Financial Condition Year end working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) totaled $622.7 million in 2011 and $619.8 million in 2010. The current level of working capital does not fully reflect the Companys liquidity position as the carrying value for inventories under last in, first out accounting was $580.2 million below fair value at December 31, 2011. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 totaled $513.9 million compared to $535.8 million at year end 2010. Long term debt decreased by $689.8 million during 2011 and totaled $249.6 million at year end 2011, representing 2.8% of total capital employed. The reduction in long term debt in 2011 included a $350.0 million reclassification of notes payable to a current liability. These notes mature in May 2012 and the Company is evaluating whether to sell replacement debt instruments. Long term debt decreased by $413.8 million in 2010. Stockholders equity was $8.78 billion at the end of 2011 compared to $8.20 billion a year ago and $7.35 billion at the end of 2009. A summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page F 8 of this Form 10 K report. Other changes in Murphys year end 2011 balance sheet compared to 2010 included an $84.5 million reduction in the balance of short term investments in Canadian government securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase. The total investment in these Canadian government securities was $532.1 million at year end 2011 and $616.6 million at year end 2010. These slightly longer term investments were purchased in each year because of a tight supply of shorter term securities available for purchase in Canada. An $86.9 million increase in accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily caused by higher sales prices for crude oil and finished products sold, and higher natural gas sales volumes sold on credit terms by the Company, but partially offset by the sale of U.S. refineries in 2011, which effectively reduced refined products volumes sold under credit arrangements in the U.S. in 2011. Inventory values were $95.6 million less at year end 2011 than in 2010 mostly due to lower levels of crude oil and refined products held in storage within downstream operations in the later year due to sale of two refineries in the U.S., but partially offset by higher costs for unsold crude oil production held in inventory in the current year. Prepaid expenses increased $5.2 million in 2011 primarily due to prepaid income taxes in the U.S. at year end 2011. Short term deferred income tax assets were $6.9 million higher at year end 2011 compared to 2010 due mostly to more current temporary differences for expense deductions within U.K. downstream operations. Net property, plant and equipment increased by $107.3 million in 2011 as a significant level of property additions during the year exceeded the amounts of depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses recorded during 2011. Goodwill decreased $1.0 million in 2011 due to a weaker Canadian dollar exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. Deferred charges and other assets decreased $98.4 million mostly due to no deferred turnaround costs and other noncurrent assets remaining for the Meraux and Superior refineries following their sale in 2011. Current maturities of long term debt at year end 2011 was $350.0 million higher than at the prior year end due to a reclassification of $350.0 million of outstanding notes payable to current based on their upcoming maturity in May 2012. Accounts payable decreased by $296.9 million at year end 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower amounts owed for purchased crude oil feedstocks following the sale of the U.S. refineries in 2011. Income taxes payable was $157.0 million lower at year end 2011 than at the end of 2010, primarily due to less U.S. income tax liabilities owed in 2011. Other taxes payable at year end 2011 was $37.4 million lower than in 2010 mostly due to less value added taxes owed by the U.K. downstream operations 40 Table of Contents and lower excise taxes owed by U.S. downstream operations. Other accrued liabilities increased by $30.1 million at year end 2011 mostly due to higher amounts owed for compensation and other operating costs. The current portion of deferred income tax liabilities increased $5.3 million in 2011 due to higher short term temporary differences for tax deductions in Canada in the current year. Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities were $17.9 million higher at year end 2011 mostly due to accelerated tax depreciation associated with the Companys 2011 capital expenditures, primarily in Malaysia and Canada. The liability associated with future asset retirement obligations increased by $60.3 million at year end 2011 mostly due to higher estimated future costs to retire assets in the U.S. and Canada. Deferred credits and other liabilities were $43.6 million more in 2011 compared to 2010 mostly due to higher noncurrent liabilities associated with postemployment benefit plans in the current year. Murphy had commitments for future capital projects of approximately $1.85 billion at December 31, 2011, including $839.5 million for field development and future work commitments in Malaysia, $149.7 million for costs to develop deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, $124.5 million for work in the Eagle Ford Shale and $127.5 million for future work commitments offshore Brunei. The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures, but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2011, the Company had access to a long term committed credit facility in the amount of $1.5 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings under the committed credit facility at year end 2011. The most restrictive covenants under this committed credit facility limit the Companys long term debt to capital ratio (as defined in the agreements) to 60%. The committed credit facility expires in 2016. At December 31, 2011, the Company had uncommitted bank credit lines of approximately $400.0 million, but no borrowings were outstanding under these lines. The long term debt to total capital ratio was 2.8% at year end 2011. In September 2009, the Company filed a Form S 3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the offer and sale of debt and or equity securities. The Company may use this shelf registration, if needed, in future years to raise debt or equity capital to fund operational requirements. This shelf registration expires in September 2012. Current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in Note F to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the anticipated level of capital expenditures the Company has budgeted during 2012, the Company anticipates that it will need to borrow under its long term debt facility during 2012. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 15.6 to 1 in 2011, 14.6 to 1 in 2010 and 14.5 to 1 in 2009. Cash and invested cash are maintained in several operating locations outside the United States. At December 31, 2011, cash, cash equivalents and cash temporarily invested in Canadian government securities held outside the U.S. included approximately $608 million in Canada, $94 million in the U.K. and $83 million in Malaysia. In certain cases, the Company could incur taxes or other costs should these cash balances be repatriated to the U.S. in future periods. This could occur due to withholding taxes and or potential additional U.S. tax burden when less than the U.S. tax rate of 35% has been paid for cash taxes in foreign locations. A lower cash tax rate is often paid in foreign countries in the early years of operations when accelerated tax deductions exist to incent oil and gas investments; cash tax rates are generally higher in later years after accelerated tax deductions in early years are exhausted. Canada collects a 5% withholding tax on any cash repatriated to the U.S. See Note I of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding potential tax expense that could be incurred upon distribution of foreign earnings back to the United States. Environmental Matters Murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment. Virtually all operations of the Company are affected by laws and regulations covering environmental, health and safety matters. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects Murphys overall cost of business, including capital costs to construct, 41 Table of Contents maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities, and operating costs for ongoing environmental compliance. Murphys competitive position may be impacted to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that competitors might not bear. Environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities and these are expected to continue to evolve in the foreseeable future. The Company is unable to predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on its operations. Violation of federal or state environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and construction bans or delays. A discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject Murphy to substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result. Murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and such capital expenditures were $103.7 million in 2011 and are projected to be $74.7 million in 2012. The sale of U.S. refineries in 2011 will reduce future capital expenditures required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting Murphys operations are: The U.S. Clean Air Act, which regulates air emissions The U.S. Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges into U.S. waters The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates solid waste and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal. The U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States The U.S Safe Drinking Water Act, which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground injection wells The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA) also addressing discharge of pollutants into navigable waters The Department of the Interior governing offshore oil and gas operations. The European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) The European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme These laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air, water and solid waste discharges. They also generally require permits for new or modified operations. Many states and foreign countries where the Company operates also have or are in the process of developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products, which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements. Murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations, including legal and administrative proceedings, governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations, which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines, underground storage tanks and general environmental operations. Murphy is actively engaged in the legislative and regulatory process, both nationally and internationally, in response to climate change issues and environmental and health related matters. 42 Table of Contents Murphys Environmental, Health, and Safety Committee, a standing committee of the Board of Directors, was created to oversee and monitor the Companys environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policies and practices. In February 2009, the Board approved a worldwide environmental, health, and safety policy (the EHS Policy), which is available on the Companys Web site. In addition to requiring that the Company comply with all applicable EHS laws and regulations, the EHS Policy includes a directive that the Company will continue to minimize the impact of its operations, products and services on the environment by implementing economically feasible projects that promote energy efficiency and use natural resources effectively. CERCLA CERCLA commonly referred to as the Superfund Act, and comparable state statutes, primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon Potentially Responsible Parties (PRP), without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released, disposed, or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. CERCLA requires reporting to the National Response Center for releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous if the released quantities exceed an EPA established reportable level. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons. In the course of ordinary operations, the Company generates waste that falls within CERCLAs definition of a hazardous substance. Murphy may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to remediate sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment. The EPA currently considers Murphy to be a PRP at one Superfund site. The potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at this site may be substantial. However, based on current negotiations and available information, the Company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at the Superfund site and as such, it has not recorded a liability for remedial costs. The Company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating PRPs or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at this site or other Superfund sites. The Company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to remediate this Superfund site will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Waste The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past owned or leased, properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled. Although the Company has used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the Company or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under Murphys control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws Murphy could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. While some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation, investigation, and or cleanup, Murphy is investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses, including state funding for remediation, and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on its net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Although certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered from other sources, no assurance can be given that future recoveries from these sources will occur. Therefore, the Company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of December 31, 2011. RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes, with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes. Murphy generates 43 Table of Contents non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. The Companys operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances. The costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes. Such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses. Water Under OPA90, owners and operators of tankers, owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the United States. The Company is not aware of OPA90 claims made against Murphy. Each Murphy offshore facility in the Gulf of Mexico has in place an Emergency Evacuation Plan (EEP) and all such facilities are covered by an Oil Spill Response Plan (OSRP). In the event of an explosion, personnel would be evacuated immediately in accordance with the EEP. The appropriate OSRP would be activated if needed. In the event of an oil spill or containment event, the appropriate OSRP and Containment Plan would be executed as needed. The EEP is approved by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the OSRP and Containment Plan are approved by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The Company also has comprehensive emergency and spill response plans for offshore facilities in international waters. Murphys OSRP utilizes a consortium of seasoned and well equipped contract service companies to provide response equipment and personnel. One company has been contracted to provide spill containment and recovery equipment, including skimmers, boom, and vessels such as fast response boats and high volume open sea skimmer barges. This company has hired other companies to store and maintain response equipment and provide certified tanks and barges. Murphy is a founding member of Marine Preservation Association, which provides access to Marine Spill Response Corporation assets to support marine spills in the Gulf of Mexico and other offshore areas. Additionally, Murphy has an agreement with another company to provide aerial dispersant spraying services, and has further contracted with another company to utilize their equipment for oil containment should a well blowout occur. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA) imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The FWPCA imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Murphy maintains wastewater discharge permits for its facilities where required pursuant to the FWPCA and comparable state laws. Murphy has also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws. The Company believes that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity in a future period. Murphy utilizes hydraulic fracturing technology for its exploration and production activities in Canada and the U.S. Murphy is actively engaged in exploration and production in the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas. On January 31, 2012, the Texas Railroad Commission finalized a rule that requires oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals and amount of water used in hydraulic fracturing of wells. Air Murphys U.S. operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which it operates. Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act enacted in 1990 required most refining operations in the U.S. to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the EPA and state environmental agencies. 44 Table of Contents Under the EPAs Clean Air Act authority, the National Petroleum Refinery (NPR) Initiative (Global Consent Decree) was used by the EPA to undertake at virtually all U.S. refineries an investigation of four marquee compliance areas, including: (i) New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration for fluidized catalytic cracking units, heaters and boilers; (ii) New Source Performance Standards for flares, sulfur recovery units, fuel gas combustion devices (including heaters and boilers); (iii) Leak Detection and Repair requirements; and (iv) Benzene National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Murphy began negotiations with the EPA in 2005, but was interrupted by the events of Hurricane Katrina. The states of Louisiana and Wisconsin are both parties to the NPR. Negotiations with EPA resumed in 2007 and were essentially completed in 2010. Under the Global Consent Decree, the Company paid a fine of $1.25 million and committed to certain future capital improvements. The Company sold its two U.S. refineries in 2011. The European Union has adopted an Emissions Trading Scheme in response to the Kyoto Protocol in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Murphys refinery at Milford Haven, Wales, currently has the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements. These environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred. In 2011, Murphy was notified by the Environment Agency (EA) that it failed to surrender proper emission allowances, which Murphy self reported to the EA in 2010. The Company is evaluating all available options regarding this matter. Climate Change Currently, various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include a promulgated EPA regulation, Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases for numerous industrial business segments, including refineries and offshore production, which became effective December 29, 2009. These were followed by a more recent regulation requiring Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, including onshore exploration and production facilities, which became effective December 31, 2010 and was revised December 23, 2011. During 2011, U.S. federal legislation (EPAs Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, EPAs Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, Low Carbon Fuel Standards, etc.) and various state actions were proposed/finalized to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which have or could impose mandatory reductions and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Murphy believes it has met all of the EPA required reporting deadlines and strives to ensure accurate and consistent emissions data reporting. The impact of existing and pending climate change legislation, regulations, international treaties and accords could result in increased costs to the Company to (i) operate and maintain facilities; (ii) install new emission controls on facilities; and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions trading program. These actions could also impact the consumption of refined products, thereby affecting gasoline and ethanol marketing operations. The physical impacts of climate change present potential risks for severe weather (floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.) at certain of the Companys refined product terminals in the U.S. and its offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Commensurate with this risk is the possibility of indirect financial and operational impacts to the Company from disruptions to the operations of major customers or suppliers caused by severe weather. The Company has repositioned itself to take advantage of potential climate change opportunities by acquiring renewable energy sources through the acquisition of two ethanol production facilities, thereby achieving a lower carbon footprint and an enhanced capability to meet governmental fuel standards. The Company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, or the cost impact of natural catastrophic events resulting from climate change, if it occurs, will be in future periods. The Company recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship as a core component of its mission as a responsible international energy company and has implemented sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to capture and process environmental, safety and climate change related information. As a companion to Murphys EHS Policy, the Companys Web site also contains a statement on climate change. Not only does this statement 45 Table of Contents on climate change include Murphys goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis while growing its upstream and certain downstream operations, the information on the Companys Web site describes actions already taken to move towards that goal. These efforts include incorporating climate change into the Companys planning processes, reducing emissions, pursuing new opportunities and engaging legislative and regulatory entities externally. In support of these efforts, worldwide greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted since 2001. Additionally, Murphy participates in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. The initiatives cited above demonstrate the Companys commitment regarding environmental issues, which are at the forefront of todays global public policy dialogue. Other Matters The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was signed into law in December 2007. The EISA, through EPA regulation, requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production. EISA greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) which began in September 2007. Murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to meet most of its obligation. On July 1, 2010, the RFS 2 standard came into effect requiring the blending/phase in of ethanol, biodiesel, cellulosic and advanced renewable fuels. Murphy is meeting its obligations for RFS 2 primarily through the RINs system. The Company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims, allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in its operations. Under Murphys accounting policies, an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. If there is a range of reasonably estimated costs, the most likely amount will be recorded, or if no amount is most likely, the minimum of the range is used. Recorded liabilities are reviewed routinely. Actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized. Safety Matters The Company is subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in Murphys operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. Other Matters Impact of inflation General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Companys revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future. Natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand, which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas. Prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen (with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant at times) during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services when oil and gas prices were strong. As noted earlier, oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile over the last several years. Oil prices were very strong in early to mid 2008, then fell precipitously in late 2008 and into early 2009, then have generally strengthened since that time. The prices for oil field goods and services 46 Table of Contents generally rise in periods of higher oil prices and do not usually decline as significantly as oil and gas prices in a lower price environment. Should oil prices continue to rise in future periods, the Company anticipates that prices for certain oil field equipment and services could rise sharply. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services. Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements The Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets effective January 1, 2010. This guidance makes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined previously no longer relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying special purpose entities were reevaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance. This adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted, effective January 1, 2010, guidance issued by the FASB that requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the entity or the right to receive potentially significant benefits from the entity. A company is required to make ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This guidance also amended previous guidance for determining whether an entity is considered a variable interest entity. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB issued accounting guidance that expanded the disclosure requirements about financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses. This guidance became effective for the Company at December 31, 2010. Because the Company has no significant financing receivables that extend beyond one year, the impact of this guidance did not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statement disclosures. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted revisions to oil and natural gas reserves reporting requirements which were effective for the Company at year end 2009. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that aligned its oil and gas reserves reporting requirements and effective date with the SECs guidance. The primary changes to reserves reporting included: A revised definition of proved reserves, including the use of unweighted average oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year to compute such reserves, Expanding the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include non traditional and unconventional resources, which includes the Companys Canadian synthetic oil operations at Syncrude, Allowing companies to voluntarily disclose probable and possible reserves in SEC filings, Amending required proved reserve disclosures to include separate amounts for synthetic oil and gas, Expanded disclosures of proved undeveloped reserves, including discussion of such proved undeveloped reserves five years old or more, and Disclosure of the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the Companys overall reserve process. The Company utilized the new SEC and FASB guidance at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 to determine its proved reserves and to develop associated disclosures. The Company chose not to provide voluntary disclosures of probable and possible reserves in this Form 10 K. In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the annual goodwill impairment assessment process by permitting a company to assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test. 47 Table of Contents If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company would be required to conduct the current two step goodwill impairment test. This change is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning in 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard in 2012 to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that only permits two options for presentation of Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive Income can be presented in (a) a single continuous Statement of Comprehensive Income, including total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income, or (b) in two separate but continuous statements for the Statement of Income and the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2012. As in prior years, the Company expects to continue to present the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in two separate statements, and the adoption of this guidance in 2012 is not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB deferred the requirement for reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to be measured and presented by line item in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The United States Congress passed the Dodd Frank Act in 2010. Among other requirements, the law requires companies in the oil and gas industry to disclose payments made to the U.S. Federal and all foreign governments. The SEC was directed to develop the reporting requirements in accordance with the law. The SEC has issued preliminary guidance and has received feedback thereon from interested parties. The preliminary rules indicated that payment disclosures would be required at a project level within the annual Form 10 K report beginning with the year ending December 31, 2012. The SEC has not issued final guidance regarding required disclosure. Therefore, it is expected that reporting will be delayed beyond year end 2012. The Company cannot predict the final disclosure requirements that will be required by the SEC. Significant accounting policies In preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below. Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require that we use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining proved reserve quantities. These historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can 48 Table of Contents lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Companys depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. Downward reserve revisions can also lead to significant impairment expense. The Company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. The Companys proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages F 48 and F 49 of this Form 10 K. Murphy has utilized reliable geologic and engineering technology in 2011 to include proved undeveloped reserves more than one location from producing wells in the more developed portions of the Eagle Ford Shale. The study incorporated public and proprietary data from multiple sources and encompassed the entire basin. This included analysis of seismic data, well log data, test production and fluids properties to establish geologic consistency as well as significant statistical performance data yielding predictable and repeatable reserve estimates within certain analogous areas. These locations were limited to only those areas with both established geologic consistency and sufficient statistical performance data where such data could be demonstrated to provide reasonable certain results. Oil proved reserves revisions Positive proved oil reserve revisions in the U.S. in 2011 were primarily associated with better production at the Medusa field in the Gulf of Mexico. Positive 2011 oil revisions for Canada conventional operations were mostly attributable to better well performance at the Hibernia field, offshore Eastern Canada. Synthetic oil operations had positive reserve revisions in 2011 due to change in royalty rate. Positive oil revisions in 2011 in Malaysia were primarily at the Kikeh field caused by production performance. Positive oil revisions in the U.K. in 2011 were associated with the Schiehallion field which is being redeveloped by its owners. The negative revision in oil reserves in Republic of the Congo in 2011 was attributable to poor production results for wells in the field. The positive revision in U.S. proved oil reserves in 2010 was primarily associated with better than anticipated performance of wells at the Thunder Hawk and Medusa fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Better well performance at the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields led to favorable proved oil reserve revisions in Canada in 2010. Proved oil reserves for Canadian synthetic oil operations had a positive revision in 2010 primarily due to a lower royalty. The positive proved oil reserve revision in Malaysia in 2010 primarily related to better well performance at the Kikeh field. A positive proved oil reserve revision in Republic of the Congo in 2010 was attributable to improved terms under the production sharing agreement that allocated a larger share of production at the Azurite field to the account of the Company beginning in October 2010. A favorable oil reserve revision in 2009 in the United States was attributable to favorable performance of the Thunder Hawk and Front Runner fields and federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields. A favorable conventional oil revision in Canada in 2009 was caused by performance of the Terra Nova field and improved heavy oil pricing which added reserves in the Seal area. Due to changes in the SECs definition of proved oil reserves, which were first effective as of December 31, 2009, synthetic oil reserves are now included as proved oil reserves. Consequently, total synthetic oil reserves as of January 1, 2009 of 131.6 million barrels were added to total oil reserves in 2009. The positive revision to synthetic oil reserves during 2009 was attributable to lower royalties compared to a year earlier. An unfavorable revision to oil reserves in Malaysia in 2009 was due to current year drilling results for a well in the Kikeh field, along with reduced entitlements at Kikeh and West Patricia due to increased prices in 2009 compared to year end 2008. Oil reserves in the U.K. reflected an unfavorable revision in 2009 because of an anticipated reduction in life expectancy for major equipment at the Schiehallion project. Natural gas proved reserves revisions Proved natural gas reserves in the U.S. had negative revisions in 2011 due to well performance being less than expected in early wells drilled in the gas prone regions of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Positive gas reserve revisions in Canada in 2011 were primarily at the Tupper and Tupper West areas and these were based on better than anticipated well performance. Negative gas reserve revisions in Malaysia in 2011 were primarily due to higher sales prices which effectively reduced the entitlement percentage for 49 Table of Contents future production at the Sarawak gas fields. Negative gas reserve revisions in the U.K. in 2011 were essentially caused by revised estimate of gas cap volumes at the Mungo/Monan field. Proved natural gas reserves in the U.S. had positive revisions in 2010 due to better well performance at the Thunder Hawk and Mondo fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The positive gas reserve revision in Canada in 2010 was attributable to performance at various wells in the Tupper area of British Columbia. Proved reserves of natural gas in Malaysia were revised downward in 2010 due to higher prices leading to a lower future entitlement percentage for the Company. Positive gas reserve revisions in the U.K. in 2010 were attributable to better well performance at all gas producing fields. In 2009, a positive U.S. gas reserve revision was caused by favorable performance of the Thunder Hawk, Front Runner and Mondo NW fields as well as federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields. In Malaysia, a combination of increased entitlements due to pricing and drilling performance at the Sarawak gas project led to positive gas revisions in 2009. Gas reserves in the U.K. were favorably revised in 2009 because of the Amethyst field gas compression project and better Mungo field performance. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income. Successful exploration drilling costs, all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. In some cases, a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves cannot be made immediately. This is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon(s) found. The determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is, in turn, usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves. Under current accounting rules, the Company holds well costs in Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked, dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred. In 2011, a dry hole was recorded for a well drilled in Republic of the Congo in 2009. A significant reduction in proved oil reserves at the Azurite field in the same MPS block during 2011 reduced the likelihood of this well being produced in future years. In 2010, a dry hole was recorded for a well in the North Sea that was drilled in 2008. Extensive evaluations of this oil discovery determined in 2010 that recovery of hydrocarbons was not economical in the current price environment. There were no dry holes in 2009 that were drilled in prior years. Impairment of long lived assets The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital and abandonment costs, future margins on refined products produced and sold, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable reserve revisions, expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a propertys carrying value for possible impairment. In making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment, the Company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices, future 50 Table of Contents production volumes, and future capital and operating costs. Due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the Companys projections. Estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available. The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. In assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets, the Company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events, which include projections of future margins, future capital expenditures and future operating expenses. Future marketing or operating decisions, such as closing or selling certain assets, and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the Companys conclusion about potential asset impairment. Impairment expense of $368.6 million was recognized in 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the Azurite oil field, offshore Republic of the Congo, to fair value. The expense was necessitated by a significant year end 2011 reduction of proved reserves at this field which was caused by poor well performance. Additionally, an impairment expense of $5.2 million was recorded in 2009 to write off the remaining carrying value of one underperforming natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end 2011, the Company does not believe it had any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date. The expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods. These quoted prices often reflect higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the time of assessment. If quoted prices for future years had been lower, the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in 2011. In addition, one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices, lower future production, higher future costs, lower future margins on refining and marketing sales, or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods. Based on these unknown future factors as described herein, the Company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property, equipment and inventories, and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for Blocks H and PM 311/312 in Malaysia and Blocks MPS and MPN in Republic of the Congo, for exploration licenses in certain areas, the largest of which are Australia, Suriname, Indonesia and Brunei, and for certain basis differences in the U.K. due to managements belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans Murphy Oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense 51 Table of Contents associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs. Based on bond yields at year end 2011, the Company has used a discount rate of 4.87% at year end 2011 and beyond for the primary U.S. plans. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 6.50% for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current years pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations. The Companys normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 based on the effects of a growing employee base. In 2011, the Company paid $38.4 million into various retirement plans and $4.1 million into postretirement plans. In 2012, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $35.5 million into various retirement plans and $5.8 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected. As described above, the Companys retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5% decline in the discount rate would increase 2012 annual retirement and postretirement expenses by $6.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2012 retirement expense by $2.4 million. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and other contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the Company. Contractual obligations and guarantees The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments, and other long term liabilities. In addition, the Company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period. Total payments due after 2012 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below. Amount of Obligations (Millions of dollars) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Total debt including current maturities $ 599.6 350.0 0.1 0.1 249.4 Operating leases 826.3 161.6 265.2 150.2 249.3 Purchase obligations 2,513.4 1,967.4 478.7 47.4 19.9 Other long term liabilities 1,277.3 98.6 120.7 229.5 828.5 Total $ 5,216.6 2,577.6 864.7 427.2 1,347.1 52 Table of Contents The Company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields. In addition, the Company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section. The Companys share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above. In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. The amounts of commitments as of December 31, 2011 that expire in future periods are shown below. Amount of Commitments (Millions of dollars) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Financial guarantees $ 7.8 3.2 1.2 3.4 Letters of credit 162.9 155.7 7.2 Total $ 170.7 155.7 10.4 1.2 3.4 Material off balance sheet arrangements The Company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes. The most significant of these arrangements at year end 2011 included operating leases of floating, production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSO) for the Kikeh and Azurite oil fields, operating leases for production facilities at the Thunder Hawk and West Patricia fields and for certain land and or fueling stations in the U.K. and U.S., and natural gas transportation contracts in Western Canada. The leases call for future monthly net lease payments through 2016 at Kikeh and Azurite, through 2014 at Thunder Hawk and through 2012 at West Patricia. The U.K. and U.S. fueling stations require monthly payments mostly over the next 20 years. The Western Canada transportation contracts require minimum monthly payments through 2018. Future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown on the preceding page. Outlook Prices for the Companys primary products are often quite volatile. The price for crude oil is primarily affected by the level of demand for energy. In January 2012, West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded in a band between $98 and $103 per barrel. NYMEX natural gas traded in a band of $2.30 to $3.10 per MMBTU during this same time. U.S. retail marketing margins in January 2011 were squeezed by higher wholesale fuel costs during this period. The Company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending based on these prices. The Companys capital expenditure budget for 2012 was prepared during the fall of 2011 and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2011 levels. Since the budget was approved by the Companys Board of Directors, crude oil prices have generally been above the levels assumed in the 2012 budget, but North American natural gas prices have generally trailed the budgeted prices. Based on a recent review of capital expenditure projects, capital expenditures in 2012 are projected to total approximately $3.53 billion. Of this amount, $3.32 billion or about 94%, is allocated for the exploration and production program. Geographically, E&P capital is spread approximately as follows: 33% for the United States, 37% for Malaysia, 23% for Canada and 7% for all other areas. Spending in the U.S. is primarily associated with development and exploration programs in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas. In Malaysia, the majority of the spending is for continued development of the Kikeh and Kakap fields in Block K and oil development projects offshore Sarawak in Blocks SK 309 and SK 311. Approximately 40% of Canadian spending in 2012 will relate to natural gas development activities at the Tupper and Tupper West areas in Western Canada, with most of the remainder to be spent on continued development of the Seal heavy oil area and at Syncrude. Refining and marketing expenditures in 2012 are budgeted at about $200 million, or 6% of the Company total, including funds for construction of additional U.S. retail gasoline stations. Capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed 53 Table of Contents during 2012 and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases, which often are not anticipated at the time the Budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2012 using operating cash flow, but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities. The Companys 2012 budget calls for borrowings of long term debt during the year to fund a portion of the capital program. If oil and or natural gas prices weaken, actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such that higher than anticipated borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Companys ongoing development projects. The Company currently expects production in 2012 to average about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A key assumption in projecting the level of 2012 Company production is the anticipated ramp up of natural gas production in Western Canada. Should Canadian natural gas prices continue to remain weak throughout 2012, the Company may elect to delay its development drilling in the prolific Montney gas area. Other key assumptions necessary to achieve the anticipated 2012 production levels include continued reliability of production at significant operations such as Kikeh, Syncrude, Hibernia and Terra Nova, the continued demand for natural gas from our offshore Malaysia fields, and the continued favorable results of ongoing development activities at the Eagle Ford Shale area in South Texas. The Company announced in 2010 that it planned to exit the U.K. refining and marketing business. The sale process for this U.K. business continues to progress in early 2012. Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which express managements current views concerning future events or results, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the volatility and level of crude oil and natural gas prices, the level and success rate of our exploration programs, our ability to maintain production rates and replace reserves, customer demand for our products, political and regulatory instability, and uncontrollable natural hazards. For further discussion of risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, which begins on page 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Murphy undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, Murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions. There were short term commodity derivative contracts in place at December 31, 2011 to hedge the purchase price of about 8.0 million bushels of corn and the sales prices of about 1.1 million equivalent bushels of wet and dried distillers grain at the Companys ethanol production facilities in Hankinson, North Dakota, and Hereford, Texas. Additionally, the Company had outstanding derivative contracts to price protect the historical cost of about 2.9 million bushels of corn inventories expected to be processed at the Companys ethanol plants. A 10% increase in the respective benchmark price of these commodities would have increased the recorded net liability associated with these derivative contracts by approximately $2.0 million, while a 10% decrease would have decreased the recorded net liability by a similar amount. Changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the changes in the value for an equivalent volume of these feedstocks. There were short term derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at December 31, 2011 to hedge the value of U.S. dollars against two foreign currencies. A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign 54 Table of Contents currencies would have increased the recorded net liability associated with these contracts by approximately $17.6 million, while a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have reduced the recorded net liability by approximately $6.3 million. Changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the financial statement impact of an equivalent volume of foreign currency exposures associated with other assets and or liabilities. There were short term derivative interest rate contracts in place at December 31, 2011 to hedge fluctuations in cash flows of anticipated future semi annual interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. A 10% increase in the respective interest rate would have reduced the recorded liability associated with these derivative contracts by approximately $5.8 million, while a 10% decrease would have increased the recorded liability by a similar amount.
