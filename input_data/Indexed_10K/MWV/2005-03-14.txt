Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations OVERVIEW This Amendment No. 2 to the companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 restates consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The restatement reflects corrections related to deferred tax liabilities, certain inter company transactions and an adjustment relating to an investment in one of the companys consolidated subsidiaries. In this restatement, the company has adjusted 2003 results from a net loss of $6 million to net income of $18 million, or 9 cents per share, and has adjusted 2002 results from a net loss of $389 million to a net loss of $398 million, or $2.07 per share. The company has also made certain adjustments to its December 31, 2003 and 2002 balance sheets which are in the aggregate less than 2% of total assets or equity. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2003, the company changed the classification of its auction rate bond and note investments from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments. For a more detailed discussion of the restatement, see Note A in Item 8. Financial statements and supplementary data. Amounts for 2003 and 2002 included in this managements discussion and analysis are revised for the restatement. For the year 2003, MeadWestvaco Corporation (MeadWestvaco or the company) reported net income of $18 million, or $0.09 per share. Earnings included income from continuing operations of $22 million, or $0.11 per share, and a charge of $4 million, or $0.02 per share, for the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Included in the income from continuing operations were: pretax restructuring charges of $68 million, or $0.21 per share; II 3 Table of Contents pretax costs related to the early retirement of debt of $26 million, or $0.08 per share; and, pretax gains of $12 million, or $0.04 per share, for certain insurance settlements in the fourth quarter. In addition, the company sold 742,000 acres of forestlands for gross proceeds of $281 million, resulting in pretax gains of $106 million, or $0.33 per share. Comparable amounts for prior periods are noted later in this discussion. The amounts related to the items noted above are included in the income from continuing operations and are reflected in the corporate and other business segment. The company completed its merger synergy program, exceeding both its original goal of $325 million and its revised goal of $360 million. Synergies savings totaled over $380 million through 2003 with a run rate of over $400 million annually. Synergy effects of $167 million favorably impacted MeadWestvacos pre tax operating results when compared with 2002. Offsetting much of the merger synergies were higher costs for energy and wood that negatively impacted overall company earnings by approximately $110 million during the year and lower pension income of $70 million, compared to $124 million last year. Pension income is reported in corporate and other, and the higher energy and wood costs effects on each segment are noted in the discussions about those operations. Poor operating performance at one of the companys unbleached paperboard mills and at both of its bleached paperboard mills also offset some of the synergy savings. In addition, the companys mill based businesses experienced weakening market demand in 2003. As a result of the weaker market demand, the company took extended downtime in the second half of the year to better match production with demand in an effort to control inventory levels. In the Packaging segment, sales revenue increased, compared to 2002, although segment earnings declined due to weaker market conditions and weaker operating performance in some of the segments mill based businesses. Demand was weak for the segments bleached board packaging products, prompting the company to take significant market related downtime in the second half of the year. The segments converting operations performed well during the year, offsetting some of the performance of the mill based bleached and unbleached operations. Demand for consumer packaging remained strong in 2003, particularly for media and entertainment packaging and packaging for healthcare related items. The segments coated unbleached kraft paperboard mill and related beverage packaging business also performed well on strong demand mostly in North America. This segment, which includes most of the companys internationally focused businesses, benefited from a strengthening of other currencies against the dollar, in particular the euro. Although the Paper segment incurred a loss for the year, results improved over 2002 despite lower pricing and shipments (including January 2002 Mead shipments). This segment benefited from much of the synergy related savings that resulted from the merger. Demand continued to be weak in 2003, especially in commercial printing. As a result of lower demand, the segment took extended market related downtime during the year. Pricing for coated paper remained at historical lows, down 4% during the fourth quarter compared to last years fourth quarter, and down 2% for the year. Carbonless paper volumes were down compared to 2002, mainly in the first half of the year (including January 2002 Mead shipments). This segment continues to be negatively affected by competition from imports, particularly from Asia and Europe. Consumer and Office Products segment results were comparable to 2002. Sales were relatively flat, with operating profit slightly lower than 2002. The segment completed two niche acquisitions during 2003 to complement its already strong time management business. Offsetting the favorable effects from these additions to the business were reduced sales of commodity based school products due to increasing off shore competition. In the Specialty Chemicals segment, sales revenue increased, although operating profit declined modestly from 2002. Sales were higher, primarily in automotive markets, offsetting competitive pressures in the segments industrial markets. Results were lower in this segment due to higher costs for energy. II 4 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The merger of The Mead Corporation (Mead) and Westvaco Corporation (Westvaco) to form MeadWestvaco was completed on January 29, 2002. For accounting purposes, the merger was treated as an acquisition of Mead by Westvaco. Therefore, the historical financial statements of MeadWestvaco are the consolidated historical financial statements of Westvaco. Since the merger was effective January 29, 2002, results for 2002 include approximately 11 months of Meads operating results. Effective January 29, 2002, Westvaco changed its fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31 and MeadWestvaco has a December 31 year end. Reflecting the change in year end for Westvaco, the results presented below also include the results of operations of Westvaco only for the transition period for the two months ended December 31, 2001. Results for this transition period are not indicative of results for a full year. All references to per share amounts are on an after tax basis.

For a discussion of the restatement, see Note A in Item 8. Financial statements and supplementary data. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $7.55 billion compared to $7.24 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, and $3.94 billion in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001. The 2003 increase in sales was due primarily to the timing of the merger with only 11 months of sales for Mead included in the 2002 results. The increase in sales over the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, is due almost entirely to the merger. Income from continuing operations was $22 million, or $0.11 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $5 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2002 and income of $88 million, or $0.87 per share, in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001. In 2003, the income from continuing operations included pretax restructuring charges of $68 million, or $0.21 per share, and pretax charges related to the early retirement of debt of $26 million, or $0.08 per share. The results for 2003 also included pretax gains on the sale of forestlands of $106 million, or $0.33 per share, and pretax gains related to insurance recovery settlements of $12 million, or $0.04 per share. Results for 2003 were also impacted by the sale of the companys investment in a convertible debenture that resulted in a pretax gain of $5 million, or $0.02 per share, as well as the performance of its oriented strand board (OSB) investee, which contributed $22 million in pretax earnings. Pretax pension income, before settlements and curtailments, was $70 million in 2003. OSB investee earnings are reflected in the Paper segment, and all other effects noted above are reflected in corporate and other. II 5 Table of Contents The loss from continuing operations for 2002 was $5 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $88 million, or $0.87 per share, for Westvaco for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001. The loss from continuing operations for 2002 includes pretax restructuring and merger related costs of $153 million, or $0.49 per share, a pretax charge of $6 million, or $0.02 per share, due to the retirement of higher interest rate debt and pretax gains on the sale of forestlands of $105 million, or $0.34 per share. Included in the loss from continuing operations is pension income of $124 million before settlements and curtailments. In fiscal 2001, Westvaco incurred pretax restructuring charges of $57 million and realized pretax gains on the sale of forestlands of $35 million. Charges and credits for these items included in the loss from continuing operations are included in corporate and other. Net income in 2003 included an after tax charge of $4 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143. Net loss in 2002 included a loss of $34 million, or $0.18 per share, related to discontinued operations and a charge of $359 million, or $1.87 per share, related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2002, for the impairment of premerger goodwill due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

The Packaging segment produces coated and uncoated, bleached and unbleached paperboard, linerboard and saturating kraft, as well as consumer packaging for the beverage, cosmetics, food, healthcare, pharmaceutical, tobacco and media markets. The segment also produces corrugating medium, linerboard and consumer packaging products at its Brazilian subsidiary, Rigesa, Ltda. Sales in the Packaging segment increased to $4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to 2002 sales of $3.7 billion. Sales for the year were impacted by the timing of the merger with 2002 including only 11 months of Mead operations. Overall, sales increased over 2002 due to strong performance in the converting operations and due to a positive impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, especially at the segments European based operations. The segments consumer packaging business reported strong results on higher year over year growth in media and entertainment markets as well as strong demand for healthcare packaging. This strong demand was offset in part by softness in general folding carton markets. This softness, as well as poor overall operating performance, prompted the closure of this business units general folding carton converting plants in 2003, which contributed to a loss in sales. In the beverage packaging business, sales were up due to strong demand in North America and Latin America, offset somewhat by lackluster demand in European markets. This II 6 Table of Contents business was also positively impacted by foreign exchange rates from its European based operations. Sales of Coated Natural Kraft&reg; paperboard were up in 2003 on increased shipments and somewhat higher pricing. Sales of this segments bleached and unbleached mills improved slightly in 2003 compared to 2002 on somewhat higher pricing offset, in part, by lower volumes. This decrease in volume, primarily in the last half of the year, reflected softening demand for this segments bleached products, resulting in significant market related downtime during the latter half of the year. Shipments of bleached board were down 3% from last years levels and unbleached board shipments were down approximately 2% from last year. Segment profit declined in 2003 to $275 million compared to 2002 profit of $324 million. In 2003, results were negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and wood. Energy and wood costs were approximately $72 million higher in 2003 compared to 2002. In addition, as demand for the companys bleached board began to soften in the latter half of the year, the company took approximately 78,000 tons of market related downtime at its mills, mostly in the fourth quarter, compared to 61,000 tons of total downtime in 2002. The difference in downtime had a negligible impact on results for 2003. During 2003, higher operating costs and lower production levels impacted operating results at the Covington, Virginia, mill. In addition, results at the companys Charleston, South Carolina, mill were impacted by changes being made to improve the long term competitiveness of the mill. Offsetting some of the negative impacts from the mill related businesses were positive year over year results for the consumer packaging business on strong demand in most media markets, including DVD packaging, as well as increased demand and improved manufacturing performance in healthcare related packaging. Results from the beverage packaging business were also positive as the introduction of FridgeMaster&reg; beverage dispensing cartons has taken hold in 2003. Results in beverage packaging improved over last year on higher volumes, lower costs and positive foreign currency effects, offset partially by lower pricing. Rigesa continues to contribute strong results on higher prices and volumes, offset somewhat by higher manufacturing costs. Foreign exchange gains positively affected the results of this segment by approximately $24 million over last year, mainly in Europe. Year over year, other operating cost increases adversely affected earnings by approximately $92 million, while earnings benefited by $74 million from sales price and volume increases. Favorable merger synergies also added about $17 million to segment results. Paper segment In millions Years endedDecember 31 Two monthtransitionperiod endedDecember 31 Fiscal yearendedOctober 31 2003 20022 2001 2001 Sales $ 2,127 $ 2,101 $ 101 $ 716 Segment profit (loss)1 (46 ) (71 ) (4 ) 41 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, net pension income, interest expense, income taxes, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. 2 Includes only 11 months of Mead due to the timing of the merger. The Paper segment manufactures, markets and distributes coated printing papers, carbonless copy papers and industrial specialty papers. Sales for the Paper segment were relatively flat compared to sales last year. Coated paper market conditions continue to be challenging as oversupply in this market combined with a stronger U.S. economy compared to relatively weak global economies led to continued pressure from imported paper, primarily from Asia and Europe. Overall demand for coated paper increased modestly over last year, but imports continued to grow at a much faster II 7 Table of Contents rate, contributing to significant price declines in 2003 in an effort to compete with the lower priced imported paper. Including the effects of the timing of the merger in 2002, sales for 2003 were down slightly from last year. For the year, shipments of coated paper were up compared to 2002 by approximately 4%. Including Meads shipments in January 2002, however, shipments were actually down a marginal 1% in 2003. Pricing continued to be depressed for coated paper, with average prices down approximately 2% from last years average prices. Coated paper prices ended the year much lower compared to last year as prices for the fourth quarter were 4% below last years fourth quarter and 3% below the third quarter of 2003. These lower prices are expected to continue into the first half of 2004. Shipments of carbonless paper were up on an actual basis by approximately 5% in 2003 compared to 2002. Including Meads shipments in January 2002, shipments were down approximately 5%, reflecting the continued general market decline for carbonless paper. Prices for carbonless were down 2% from 2002 prices. As coated paper demand continued to weaken as 2003 progressed, 57,000 tons of market related downtime were taken in the last half of the year to better match demand with production and to further control inventory levels. A total of 60,000 tons of market related downtime were taken in 2003, compared to 92,000 tons taken mainly in the first half of 2002. The results of merger synergies and continued consolidation of the Paper segment onto one platform have begun to become evident in the segments results. The segment loss decreased to $46 million in 2003 from a loss of $71 million last year. However, savings of about $86 million from merger synergies and consolidation of the paper platform were more than offset by lower prices and volumes ($39 million), higher costs for energy and wood ($37 million), and other higher manufacturing costs ($7 million). Although the segment took market related downtime in 2003, it was about a third less than in 2002, positively impacting segment profit in 2003 by approximately $12 million. Segment results were also impacted by the companys 50% investment in an OSB mill in Minnesota. The companys share of that investees pretax income was $22 million in 2003, compared to $4 million in 2002 on significantly higher prices for panelboard used in the construction industry. In February 2004, the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its investment in this operation to Nexfor, Inc. for $30 million in cash. Results at other investees decreased by $8 million. The markets in the specialty paper business continued to be challenging in 2003 as pricing and shipments were down due to competitive pressures in the global markets for wear resistant overlay and due to a weak global economy. Consumer and Office Products segment In millions Years endedDecember 31 Two monthtransition periodended December 31 Fiscal yearendedOctober 31 2003 20022 2001 2001 Sales $ 1,055 $ 1,053 $ 57 $ 358 Segment profit 1 126 131 1 10 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, net pension income, interest expense, income taxes, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. 2 Includes only 11 months of Mead due to the timing of the merger. The Consumer and Office Products segment manufactures, markets and distributes school and office products, time management products and envelopes in North America through both retail and commercial channels. Sales for this segment were relatively unchanged from last year with segment profit decreasing by $5 million from 2002. Sales were up only slightly over 2002 in this segment due to the exit from certain lower margin product lines as well as increased competition in certain commodity products, mainly in the segments traditional school supply business. Sales were also negatively impacted by extremely competitive pricing and a weaker economy in Mexico. II 8 Table of Contents Strong demand for time management products offset weakness in the traditional school products markets, contributing to solid performance in this segment. Products with brands such as MeadWestvacos proprietary trademark, Five Star&reg;, and licensed products from Nike, Disney and the newly acquired Thomas Kincade&reg; line of decorative calendars contributed positively to results. In addition, during 2003, this segment acquired two niche companies to supplement its already strong lineup: AMCAL, a company that designs and supplies licensed calendars, gifts and stationery products and Day Runner, Inc., a designer, developer and distributor of loose leaf, personal organizers and related products. Both of these acquisitions contributed positively to results for the year as the segment continues to integrate each of these acquisitions into its existing businesses. Merger synergies, year over year, benefited this segment by about $12 million, however, that was more than offset by the combined negative effects of higher operating costs and lower sales volumes of about $17 million. Specialty Chemicals segment Years ended December 31 Two month transitionperiod endedDecember 31 Fiscal year ended October 31 In millions 2003 2002 2001 2001 Sales $ 352 $ 343 $ 50 $ 348 Segment profit 1 45 57 4 63 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, net pension income, interest expense, income taxes, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures, markets and distributes specialty chemicals derived from sawdust and from byproducts of the pulp and papermaking process. Products include activated carbon used in emission control systems for automobiles and trucks, printing ink resins, emulsifiers used in asphalt paving, and dyestuffs. Sales increased slightly in 2003 over 2002 on strong demand for the segments carbon based products, particularly in the automotive sector, as well as solid shipments of the segments asphalt emulsifier products. Offsetting some of the strength of carbon and asphalt products was weakness in the segments more industrial markets, mainly in the ink and dyestuff markets. Segment results, although strong, were lower than last year due to lower prices and sales volumes ($2 million), especially for the segments ink business, and higher costs for energy ($13 million), offset by $3 million in favorable merger synergies year over year. Corporate and other The segment loss for corporate and other declined from $457 million to $426 million for a number of reasons, most of which have been mentioned earlier in this discussion, including lower restructuring costs ($85 million), increased merger synergies ($49 million), lower interest expense ($18 million), favorable insurance recoveries ($12 million), gain on the sale of a convertible debenture ($5 million) and higher forestland sale gains ($1 million) offset by higher employee costs, outside fees and services ($61 million), lower pension income ($54 million), higher debt retirement costs ($20 million), the effect of lower sales prices and volumes ($8 million), and other costs ($4 million). Other items Due to the timing of the merger, 2002 selling, general and administrative expenses excluded Meads selling, general and administrative expenses in January 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $865 million in 2003 compared to $856 million in 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses included $21 million of restructuring charges compared to $78 million of restructuring and merger related expenses in 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher in 2003 due to increased employee related costs, higher outside fees and services and lower pension income compared to last year. II 9 Table of Contents Interest expense decreased to $292 million in 2003 compared to $310 million in 2002 as the company took actions to reduce higher cost debt and continued to utilize interest rate swaps to move some of its fixed rate debt to variable rates. Pension income, before settlements and curtailments, was $70 million before taxes compared to $124 million in 2002, reflecting the companys continued overfunded position in its qualified plans. Other expense (income), net increased in 2003 to $(134) million from $(104) million in 2002. Included in other expense (income), net are gains on the sales of forestlands of $106 million. The gains recorded in 2003 were comparable to levels recorded in 2002. Total investee income in 2003 was $21 million compared to $11 million in 2002 due to improved performance of the companys OSB investee. In 2003, the company incurred $26 million of expenses in connection with the early extinguishment of higher coupon debt compared to $6 million of similar charges in 2002. In the fourth quarter, the company also sold its investment in certain convertible debentures, which resulted in a gain of $5 million in 2003, and recorded an insurance recovery settlement gain of $12 million related to the reimbursement of certain defense costs incurred by the company. The companys annual effective tax benefit rate for 2003 was 185% compared to an annual effective tax benefit rate of 69% for 2002. The increase in the annual effective tax rate in 2003 reflects a deferred tax benefit adjustment associated with property, plant and equipment, made in 2003, and is higher than the statutory rate due to the composition and mix of earnings and losses in certain jurisdictions, primarily domestic operations. Outlook Despite an extremely challenging business environment in 2003, the company continues to make progress toward strengthening its competitive position and financial condition. Management continues to focus on elements that it can control. In the past two years, the companys objective was to realize the cost savings afforded by the merger synergies. At December 31, 2003, the company completed the merger synergy program and surpassed its original goals. Beginning in 2004, the company has implemented a new productivity initiative with a goal of achieving $500 million in productivity improvements over the next two years, which includes $250 million in pretax earnings improvement and $250 million in better working capital performance. The measurement of the earnings improvement will exclude pricing changes that the companys mill based businesses might experience in 2004 and 2005 and will be measured over and above any effects of inflationary cost increases. The measurement of the improvement in working capital will factor in any change in sales during 2004 and 2005. As a result of actions taken to accomplish this initiative, management expects to incur approximately $75 million to $100 million in costs. Most of those costs are expected to be incurred during 2004. Earnings improvement is expected to come from three sources: cost reductions, product mix enhancements and volume growth. The company anticipates reducing working capital by reducing inventory levels and accounts receivable and increasing accounts payable. The companys Packaging segment had mixed results in 2003 compared to 2002. Although the segment saw strong performance from its consumer packaging and beverage packaging businesses, results from the segments mill based businesses offset much of that performance. Demand for media and entertainment packaging remains strong throughout these markets. Healthcare related packaging markets also remain strong, including regulatory compliance packaging. The beverage packaging business continues its successful rollout of FridgeMaster&reg; packaging with market acceptance continuing to grow for this packaging concept. Rigesa, the companys Brazilian subsidiary, continues to grow both on volume and pricing, despite that countrys continuing uncertain geopolitical environment. In the segments mill based businesses, demand for bleached board was weak in 2003, mostly in the last half of the year. Although there were early signs of general economic improvement in the U.S. economy in the II 10 Table of Contents fourth quarter, management expects continuing challenges for these businesses and expects to take 26,000 tons of market related downtime in the first quarter of 2004. In response, the company has realigned the management teams to better focus on individual markets and on improving the operating performance of its bleached and unbleached packaging mills. In its Paper segment, the company took actions over the last two years to improve the competitive position of its coated paper business. This year, those actions are beginning to show in the segments results. Despite lower pricing and volumes, this segment experienced improved results in 2003 compared to 2002. Although the segment is still incurring operating losses, the paper mills are operating better than they did in 2002. Despite lower volumes in 2003, volume declines in this business were less than the industry average domestically. The segment continued to be plagued by global oversupply of coated paper throughout 2003, which drove a continued influx of paper to the U.S. from Europe and Asia. Early economic indicators appear to point to improving demand in 2004, especially in commercial print markets. Management expects that any significant firming in global market demand, combined with tighter domestic supply resulting from minimal capacity expansion, could lead to improved mill operating rates for the coated paper business. In addition, the recent weakening of the dollar relative to other currencies could contribute to a decline in imports of coated paper. In the near term, despite these early signs of improving market fundamentals, the company expects pricing levels to remain weak into the first half of 2004, and the segment anticipates taking 32,000 tons of coated paper market related downtime in the first quarter. Demand for the companys consumer and office products is expected to remain solid in 2004. Strengthened by two niche acquisitions, AMCAL and Day Runner, this segments time management products exhibit strong presence in major retail and commercial channels. Continued integration of these two acquisitions should contribute to improved operating performance in 2004. This segments traditional back to school products have felt pressure from imported products, specifically in its commodity lines. Strong proprietary brands, along with licensed products, continue to provide strong results in the business segments value added product lines, offsetting losses in lower margin commodity products. This segments time management products continue to be some of the most well recognized brands in the marketplace. The Specialty Chemicals segment saw strong growth in 2003 in its automotive based carbon markets. Growth in the automotive markets is expected to continue to be strong in 2004, driven by incentives offered by domestic car manufacturers and the continued low interest rate environment. Strong customer acceptance of the segments carbon honeycomb products should also contribute to positive results for this segment. Although the broader market for the segments asphalt products is expected to decline over the next year or two, management expects the segments share to grow through alliances that the business has with other companies in these markets. The segment is focused on continued product innovation, creating alternative uses for many of the byproducts of the papermaking process. The first quarter of the year is a seasonally weaker period for several of the companys businesses, including the Consumer and Office Products segment and several Packaging segment businesses. In Consumer and Office Products, the company typically expects a loss in the first quarter as the business builds inventory for its back to school selling season in the second and third quarters and for the peak selling season for time management products in the second half of the year. The first quarter is also a seasonally slower period for beverage packaging systems, many of the companys consumer packaging businesses and coated printing paper and bleached paperboard. Capital spending was $393 million in 2003 and is expected to be approximately $400 million in 2004. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $724 million in 2003 and is expected to be approximately $750 million in 2004. Interest expense totaled $292 million in 2003. Management expects interest expense to be approximately $275 million to $280 million in 2004. The company plans to continue to apply cash generated from operations and from ongoing divestitures of nonstrategic assets to reduce debt. II 11 Table of Contents The company currently estimates overall pension income in 2004 to be similar to the $70 million before taxes recorded in 2003. This estimate also assumes a discount rate of 6% compared to 6.5% in 2003 and an assumed rate of salary increases of 4% compared to 4.5% in 2003. Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the Forward looking statements section later in this document. Year ended December 31, 2002 Packaging segment: Segment profit in 2002 was $324 million compared to fiscal year 2001 profit of $196 million. Most of the increased results in 2002 was a result of the merger. Additionally, results for the companys unbleached packaging operations in Charleston, South Carolina, and in Brazil were stronger than the prior year. At the Charleston mill, higher shipments, primarily of linerboard, and lower costs, partially offset by lower average pricing, led to higher operating profit. At Rigesa, results were up over 2001 as volume, price and product mix improved, offsetting unfavorable currency exchange rates. Results also improved in the consumer packaging business as sales of DVD related packaging, in which the company has a leading market position, were very strong worldwide, offsetting continued softness in markets for CD music packaging. Lower costs and improvement in markets for packaging of cosmetics, personal care, confectionery and tobacco products also contributed to stronger results in consumer packaging. Results in the packaging systems business were also strong as sales of beverage packaging increased in North America and Latin America compared to the prior year, offsetting softness in its other markets. In the companys bleached paperboard operations, the benefits of higher year over year shipments were offset by lower average prices and higher conversion costs. These higher conversion costs were due in part to higher scheduled maintenance expense and machine improvement downtime experienced early in the year at the Evadale, Texas, mill. Results for 2002 also benefited from lower market related downtime in the segments bleached and unbleached businesses. In 2002, the company took downtime of approximately 61,000 tons with an estimated impact on pretax profit of $14 million. Shipments of bleached paperboard and linerboard were up over the prior year by 3% and 16%, respectively. In 2002, average prices for bleached paperboard were about 2% lower than in 2001, reflecting a weaker economy particularly in the first half of the year. Linerboard prices were approximately 7% lower than in 2001. Paper segment: Almost all of the increased results from fiscal year 2001 is the result of the merger with Mead. Results for the Paper segment in 2002 reflect the effects of a weak economy and a strong U.S. dollar, particularly in the first half, which resulted in lower demand and lower prices. In response to weaker demand, the company took higher market related downtime, primarily in the first half of the year. In 2002, the company took market related downtime of approximately 92,000 tons compared to approximately 78,000 tons in 2001. Sales for the Paper segment increased from the prior years sales as a result of the merger. Selling prices for all grades were lower in 2001 and, most importantly, prices for coated paper were 7% below the prior year. Price increases for certain grades of coated paper were announced to take effect in October 2002; other increases were announced to take effect in January 2003. The price increases were not fully realized in 2002 as weaker mix and higher returns and allowances offset the effect of the increases. In addition, volumes were down from 2001 in coated paper reflecting weak economic conditions. Shipment volumes of carbonless paper also declined, reflecting the weak economic conditions and the general market decline for carbonless paper. The negative effect on profit of lower sales and higher market related downtime in 2002 compared to 2001 was somewhat offset by lower operating costs and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from merger synergies. During the year, the Paper segment took a number of significant actions to lower its costs and strengthen its market II 12 Table of Contents position. These actions included the consolidation of its sales force and product lines, the permanent shutdown of a coated paper machine and the announced plans to shut down eight sheeters at the Luke, Maryland, mill, and the closure of three older, high cost paper machines and related facilities in Chillicothe, Ohio. The Paper segment results benefited from these merger synergies in 2002. The markets in the specialty paper business were also challenging in 2002 as pricing and shipments were down by 4% and 10%, respectively, due to competing technologies for some of the companys products and a weak global economy. Downward pressure on pricing resulted from international competition. Although pricing and shipments declined in 2002 for specialty papers, operating profit improved slightly due to cost reduction actions. Consumer and Office Products segment: Segment sales in 2002 were significantly higher than fiscal year 2001 sales due to the merger with Mead. In 2002, Meads consumer and office products business was combined with Westvacos envelope business to form MeadWestvacos Consumer and Office Products segment. Sales were also lower for some commodity products due to increased competition and actions taken to improve the segments product mix. Sales for the segments licensed and proprietary branded products in the school, office and time management lines remained about even with results of the Mead business. During the third quarter of 2002, the company announced plans to close three envelope manufacturing plants in Worcester and Springfield, Massachusetts, and to consolidate the northeastern envelope operations in Enfield, Connecticut. Results for the envelope business improved marginally over the prior year as the effects of the envelope integration efforts began to be realized. Compared to fiscal year 2001 results, 2002 segment profits improved significantly due to the merger. Specialty Chemicals segment: Profit for the segment declined slightly in 2002 compared to the prior year as a result of lower volume and prices in some industrial chemical markets, modestly offset by lower operating costs and improved sales and market conditions for dye dispersants and some ink resins. During 2002, sales of activated carbon products to the automotive market improved over the prior year as the companys product capabilities continued to be enhanced to meet higher auto and truck emission standards. Sales of asphalt emulsifiers and fabric dye dispersants also increased due to the introduction of new products and stronger export sales. Other items: Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 reflect pretax restructuring and merger related charges of $78 million recorded during the year. Interest expense increased to $310 million in 2002 compared to $208 million in fiscal 2001 for Westvaco only, due to debt assumed in the merger with Mead, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. The effective tax rate of 69% represented the tax benefit on the pretax loss in 2002. Differences from the statutory rate resulted primarily from the effect of the mix of earnings due to lower tax rates in some states where income and losses were apportioned as well as lower tax rates in international jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of 2002, earnings benefited from adjustments to inventory primarily related to LIFO (last in, first out) and other adjustments, partially offset by increased benefit accruals principally related to healthcare costs and workers compensation. In addition, earnings benefited from favorable developments in 2002 related to environmental liabilities offset by provisions for litigation expense including asbestos related cases. Pension income, before settlements and curtailments, was $124 million before taxes in 2002, reflecting the companys continued overfunded position in its qualified plans. Other expense (income), net increased in 2002 to $(104) million from $(48) million in fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily due to increased gains on sales of forestland which were $105 million before tax in 2002 compared to $35 million in fiscal 2001. Other expense (income), net in 2002 also included earnings from investees of $11 million offset by costs of $6 million before tax due to the early extinguishment of debt. II 13 Table of Contents Two month transition period ended December 31, 2001 The two month transition periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the fiscal years ended October 31, 2001 and 2000 discussed, below represent the premerger results for Westvaco only. Sales for the two months ended December 31, 2001, were $603 million compared to $631 million for the same period in 2000, due to an 11% decrease in average selling price, offset by an increase in volume of 7%. The companys results during this period reflected the weak global economic climate for many of the companys products and competitive pressures due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly in the Paper segment. The net loss for the two months ended December 31, 2001, was $22 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to net income of $26 million, or $0.26 per share, for the same period in 2000. Results for the two months ended December 31, 2001, reflect the effect of market related downtime of about 70,000 tons, with an estimated negative impact on earnings of $15 million before taxes, or $0.09 per share, compared to only 31,000 tons, or about $8 million before taxes, or $0.05 per share, for 2000. Results for the 2001 period also included $0.10 per share in higher costs and expenses for the writedowns of plant and equipment taken out of service, writedowns of inventories due to lower cost or market valuations, increased costs associated with the acceleration of maintenance to coincide with market related downtime, and other items principally relating to employee benefits and receivables. Packaging segment: Sales for the Packaging segment decreased 2% for the two months ended December 31, 2001, compared to the same period in 2000 due to weaker business conditions and lower sales prices across the sector. Volume for the segment increased 10% during the two month period as a result of acquisitions made during the 2001 fiscal year, while average prices were 12% lower. The Packaging segment experienced a loss of $6 million for the two months ended December 31, 2001, compared to operating profit of $41 million in the same period of the prior year due to the weaker economy, which resulted in lower demand and prices for some bleached and unbleached paperboard, particularly heavy weight paperboards and food service products. Higher energy and chemical costs and the acceleration of maintenance projects during market related machine downtime also contributed to lower operating profits. Responding to market conditions, the company took downtime at the Charleston, South Carolina, Covington, Virginia, and Evadale, Texas, mills of about 57,000 tons with an estimated negative impact on earnings of approximately $11 million before taxes, or $0.07 per share. For the two months ended December 31, 2001, sales to the tobacco industry accounted for approximately 16% of Packaging segment sales compared to approximately 18% in the same period of 2000. Of these sales to tobacco markets, approximately 9% of the segment sales were attributable to foreign operations, exported or used to produce products for export, while the remaining 7% was sold to the domestic tobacco industry for sale in the United States. Paper segment: Paper segment sales for the two months ended December 31, 2001, decreased 12% from the same period in 2000 due to a decrease in average prices of 17%, offset by an increase in volume of 5%. The Paper segment experienced a loss of $4 million for the two months ended December 31, 2001 compared to an operating profit of $13 million for the same two month period in 2000, principally due to a slower economy, the effect of a strong U.S. dollar and the resulting competitiveness of imports, weak pricing and market related downtime of approximately 13,000 tons, which negatively impacted segment profit by about $4 million before taxes, or $0.02 per share. Consumer and Office Products segment: Consumer and Office Products segment sales (which comprises only the envelope division) were down slightly from the prior year transition period while operating profit was about the same. Shipment volumes were down 2% in the 2002 transition period compared to the same period in 2001. Specialty Chemicals segment: Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment declined by 11% due to a decrease in II 14 Table of Contents average price of 13%, partially offset by an increase in volume of 2%. Sales declined due to slower economic activity and increased competition from products produced in the Far East. As a result of weak economic conditions, the company took market related downtime to manage production and overall inventory levels. Operating profit for the two months ended December 31, 2001 declined 56% from the same period in 2000 to a level of $4 million due to weak market conditions and lower production. Other items: Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% from the same period in 2000 as a result of acquisitions in the second half of fiscal year 2001. Interest expense decreased by 7% for the two month period ended December 31, 2001, compared to the same period in 2000 due to lower interest rates. Other expense (income), net for the two month period ended December 31, 2001, was $3 million compared to $(10) million, for the same period in 2000. This decline is due primarily to the writeoff in December 2001 of a research facility that was closed. In 2000, other expense (income), net included a gain from the sale of a real estate lease in New York, New York. The effective tax rate of 43.6% represents a tax benefit resulting from a pretax loss recorded in the two months ended December 31, 2001. The same period in fiscal year 2001 reflected pretax income and a tax provision. Fiscal year 2001 Sales for fiscal year 2001 were $3.9 billion compared to $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2000, due to an increase in volume of 4% offset by a 2% decrease in average prices. As a result of the weak economy, the company, through market related downtime, reduced production by 194,000 tons with an estimated negative impact on earnings of $44 million before taxes, or $0.27 per share, to manage production and overall inventory levels. Due to weak markets, demand and pricing for the companys coated papers and certain grades of paperboard declined. The strong U.S. dollar also affected the companys coated papers markets as the resulting competitiveness of imports affected pricing and volumes in coated papers. Net income in fiscal year 2001 was $88 million, or $0.87 per share, compared to $246 million, or $2.44 per share, for fiscal year 2000. Earnings for fiscal year 2001 included a pretax restructuring charge of $57 million, or $0.35 per share, due to fixed asset writedowns, employee terminations and other exit costs, primarily due to the closings of the companys fine papers mill in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, and consumer packaging plants in Richmond, Virginia, and Memphis, Tennessee. Fiscal 2001 also included a $0.10 per share benefit resulting from increased utilization of domestic research and foreign tax credits and the resolution of prior years tax issues and a pretax gain of $5 million, or $0.03 per share, from the sale of a real estate lease in New York, New York. Earnings for fiscal year 2000 included a pretax restructuring charge of $27 million, or $0.18 per share, resulting primarily from a writedown of assets due to the anticipated decline in future sales of folding cartons to domestic tobacco markets, a pretax gain of $11 million, or $0.07 per share, from the sale of a liquid packaging plant previously written down as part of the restructuring charge in 1999, an after tax charge of $9 million, or $0.09 per share, from the early retirement of higher interest rate debt, and an after tax gain of $4 million, or $0.04 per share, from the sale of an interest in a joint venture in China. Packaging segment: Sales for the Packaging segment increased 11% from fiscal year 2000 due to the acquisitions of AGI (formerly known as IMPAC), which was acquired in July 2000, and of Alfred Wall AG, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. Volume for the segment increased 14% and price decreased by 3%. Operating profit for the Packaging segment for fiscal year 2001 decreased by 44% to $196 million from fiscal 2000 due to the weaker economy and increased energy costs, as well as lower demand and prices for some bleached and unbleached paperboard. Responding to market conditions, the company took downtime at the Charleston, South Carolina, Covington, Virginia, and Evadale, Texas, mills of about 174,000 tons with an estimated negative impact on annual earnings of $37 million before taxes. An additional 17,000 tons of downtime was taken in August 2001 due to a manufacturing interruption at the Evadale, Texas, mill, but the production rate was fully recovered by September. During fiscal year 2001, approximately 15% of Packaging segment sales were made to the tobacco industry for packaging tobacco products compared to approximately 19% for fiscal year 2000. Of these tobacco sales, II 15 Table of Contents approximately 8% of segment sales were exported or used to produce products for export with the remaining 7% sold to the domestic tobacco industry for sale in the United States. Rigesa, the companys Brazilian subsidiary, benefited from increased demand for most of its value added products, particularly fruit packaging, although its operating profit and revenues declined compared to the fiscal year 2000 period as a result of weaker local currency exchange rates. Paper segment: Paper segment sales for the fiscal year 2001 decreased 17% from the fiscal year 2000 due to decreases in volume of 16% and price of 1%. A strong U.S. dollar and the resulting competitiveness of imports affected pricing and volumes in coated papers as did the lower level of economic activity. Paper segment operating profit decreased substantially to $41 million for fiscal 2001 compared to $130 million for fiscal year 2000, principally due to a slowing economy, as well as higher energy costs and market related downtime of approximately 21,000 tons, which negatively impacted segment profit by about $7 million before taxes. Consumer and Office Products segment: Sales for the segment (which comprises only the envelope division) were down approximately 5% in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000. Prices and volumes were down 1% and 4%, respectively, in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. Operating profit in fiscal 2001 was relatively consistent with results from fiscal 2000 as costs were lower in fiscal 2001. Specialty Chemicals segment: Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment declined by 3% in fiscal year 2001 due to a decrease in volume of 6%, partially offset by an increase in price of 3%. Sales of resins used in printing inks and other products increased while sales of fabric dye dispersants declined due to slower economic activity and increased competition from products produced in the Far East. Sales of carbon products for emission protection in the automotive markets were weaker due to a lower level of economic activity. The fiscal year 2001 operating profit declined 3% to a level of $63 million due to higher fuel prices. Other items: Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 31% as a result of acquisitions in the current year compared to fiscal year 2000 in which acquisitions were included for only a portion of the year. The increase is also attributable to the continued development of the companys technology platform. Interest expense increased by 8% in fiscal year 2001 compared to fiscal year 2000 due to higher interest costs relating to acquisitions closed during the prior year. Other expense (income), net of $(48) million in fiscal 2001 changed from $(43) million in fiscal 2000 due primarily to lower interest income while gains on land sales were higher by 30% due to an increased level of sales activity following the companys strategic review of its forestland holdings. Earnings for fiscal year 2001 include pretax gains from land sales of $35 million compared to $27 million in fiscal year 2000. Other expense (income), net also includes a pretax gain of $5 million, from the sale of a real estate lease in New York, New York. In fiscal 2000, other expense (income), net also included pretax costs of $14 million associated with the extinguishment of debt. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2001 decreased to 25.4% from 36.9% in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings attributable to foreign operations and subject to lower rates, research credit utilization and the favorable resolution of prior years tax issues, partially offset by higher nondeductible goodwill amortization. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash generated from operations and the proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets, mainly forestlands, provided the major source of funds for the company. These sources are expected to continue to be a significant source of funds in the future. Short term borrowings are used to finance seasonal needs during spring and summer as the Packaging and Consumer and Office Products segments are building seasonal inventories and receivables. The company anticipates that its cash flows will be sufficient to fund its needs including debt service and payment of dividends. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $215 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $372 million at December 31, 2002. The company had no short term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002. II 16 Table of Contents Operating activities The company generated cash flows from operations of $463 million in 2003 compared to $494 million in 2002. Cash flows from operating activities for Westvaco only for the two month transition period ended December 31, 2001, and fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, were $34 million and $253 million, respectively. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.6 at December 31, 2003, compared to 1.5 at December 31, 2002. Investing activities Capital spending totaled $393 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $424 million during the same period last year. This level of capital spending is well below the companys 2003 charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization of $724 million. Because of the well invested nature of the companys facilities, management was able to lower its capital spending targets to preserve capital and optimize returns on new investments in this challenging economic environment. Management anticipates that this lower level of capital spending will continue into 2004 with estimated spending of approximately $400 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to be approximately $750 million for 2004. Capital expenditures for Westvaco only for the two month transition period ended December 31, 2001, and fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, were $56 million and $296 million, respectively. During 2003, the company acquired AMCAL, a company that designs and supplies licensed calendars, gifts and stationery products. In addition, the company acquired Day Runner, Inc., a designer, developer and distributor of loose leaf, personal organizers and related products for the retail stationery market. These transactions did not have a material impact on the cash flows of the company. The company completed the sale of 742,000 acres of forestlands, generating gross proceeds of $281 million. Overall, asset sales generated $376 million of proceeds in 2003 compared to $530 million last year. Total proceeds in 2003 include proceeds of approximately $50 million from the sale of the companys investment in certain convertible debentures as well as various other asset sales. Last year the company generated approximately $375 million in proceeds from the sale of the companys discontinued U.S. containerboard business. For 2002, the company generated $134 million of proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic forestlands. Management is committed to the forestland sale program with approximately 400,000 acres remaining to be sold under the current program. Management expects to generate proceeds of approximately $150 million to $200 million in 2004 from these forestland sales. The companys short term investments of $10 million at December 31, 2003, consist of auction rate securities that are secured by bonds and notes classified as available for sale securities. Investments in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates, which typically reset every seven to 35 days. Despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities, the company has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities. Total purchases and sales of these securities are shown separately in the statements of cash flows. All income generated from these current investments was recorded as interest income. Financing activities In December 2001, MeadWestvaco arranged a $500 million bank credit facility that expires in December 2006 and an additional $500 million bank credit agreement with a 364 day maturity that was renewed in December 2003. This renewed facility expires in December 2004. The combined $1 billion of credit facilities were unused at December 31, 2003. Borrowings under these agreements can be in unsecured domestic or Eurodollar notes and at rates approximating prime or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at the companys option. The $1 billion revolving credit agreements contain certain financial covenants with which the company is in compliance. II 17 Table of Contents There were no short term borrowings at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Average commercial paper borrowings were $304 million and $213 million in 2003 and 2002, at average rates of 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively. These borrowings during 2003 and 2002 funded seasonal increases in inventory and receivables at the companys Packaging and Consumer and Office Products segments. At December 31, 2003, approximately 30% of the companys debt was variable rate (primarily tax exempt bonds), after factoring in the companys interest rate swaps. The weighted average interest rate on the companys variable rate debt was 2.4% in 2003. This compares to approximately 20% variable rate debt at December 31, 2002, with an average rate of 1.3%. The percentage of debt to total capital for MeadWestvaco was 47.3% and 49.2% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the company had $269 million and $363 million of current maturities of long term debt. Cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $215 million and $372 million, respectively. On March 19, 2003, MeadWestvaco filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering up to $500 million in debt securities. On November 20, 2003, the company issued $175 million of 2.75% and $125 million of floating rate two year notes covered by this registration statement for the purpose of repayment of commercial paper. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay short term borrowings having a weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.3%. The short term borrowings being repaid were incurred by the company to repay other long term indebtedness earlier in the year and for working capital needs. In addition, the company paid down several other miscellaneous debt issuances, primarily tax exempt notes, during 2003. In 2003, two rating agencies affirmed the companys long term credit rating but updated their outlook to negative for MeadWestvaco. This negative outlook lowered the companys short term credit rating and makes it more difficult for the company to borrow in the commercial paper market. The company is exploring other options for short term funding sources to assure that it is utilizing the most cost effective means to borrow for short term needs. In 2003, the company primarily utilized the commercial paper market to fund its short term working capital needs during the year. In 2004, the company may utilize its multiyear bank credit agreement for short term funding needs. The company has available to it a total of $1 billion under its two bank credit agreements. On January 28, April 22, June 24 and October 31, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.23 per share with the company paying a total of $184 million of dividends to its shareholders in 2003. During 2002, the company paid $206 million of dividends to its shareholders, which included $23 million declared in December 2001 but paid in 2002. Effects of inflation The rate of general inflation remains at a low level and is not expected to have a significant effect on results in 2004 except for wood and energy related costs. Costs for energy, including natural gas, oil and electricity, and costs for certain raw materials, such as purchased pulp, increased significantly in 2003. The increase in these costs affected many of the companys businesses. Environmental and legal matters MeadWestvacos operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over foreign operations of the company. Mead and Westvaco made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws, rules and regulations. Due to changes in environmental laws and regulations, the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology, it is not possible for MeadWestvaco to predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes. Taking these uncertainties into account, MeadWestvaco estimates that it will incur approximately $40 million in environmental capital expenditures in 2004 and approximately $69 million in 2005. Approximately $35 million was spent on environmental capital projects in 2003. II 18 Table of Contents A portion of anticipated future environmental capital expenditures of MeadWestvaco will concern compliance with regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act (the Cluster Rules) designed to reduce air and water discharges of specific substances from U.S. pulp and paper mills by 2006. Mead and Westvaco have taken major steps to comply with the Cluster Rules. MeadWestvaco expects to incur capital expenditures beyond the expenditures stated above by approximately $13 million to comply with the Cluster Rules by 2006. The company has been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) or by various state or local governments that it may be liable under federal environmental laws or under applicable state or local laws with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances at sites previously operated or used by Mead or Westvaco. The company is currently named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) or has received third party requests for contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state or local laws with respect to numerous sites. There are other sites which may contain contamination or which may be potential Superfund sites, but for which MeadWestvaco has not received any notice or claim. The potential liability for all these sites will depend upon several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, insurance coverage and contribution by other PRPs. The company regularly evaluates its potential liability at these various sites. MeadWestvaco has recorded liabilities of approximately $33 million for estimated potential cleanup costs based upon its close monitoring of ongoing activities and its past experience with these matters. Expenses to be charged to this liability are not included in the anticipated capital expenditures previously stated. The company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with these sites may exceed amounts of recorded liabilities by an amount that could range from an insignificant amount to as much as $35 million. This estimate is less certain than the estimate upon which the environmental liabilities were based. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is managements judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. As with numerous other large industrial companies, the company has been named a defendant in asbestos related personal injury litigation. Typically, these suits also name many other corporate defendants. All of the claims against the company resolved to date have been concluded before trial, either through dismissal or through settlement with payments to the plaintiff that are not material to the company. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, have not been significant. As of February 26, 2004, there were approximately 700 lawsuits. Management believes that the company has substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. The company has valid defenses to these claims and intends to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on its historical experience in asbestos cases and an analysis of the current cases, the company believes that it has adequate amounts accrued for potential settlements and judgments in asbestos related litigation. At December 31, 2003, the company has litigation liabilities of approximately $27 million, a significant portion of which relates to asbestos. Should the volume of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that the company could incur significant costs resolving these cases. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is managements judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. MeadWestvaco was involved in a patent infringement dispute with Riverwood International regarding FridgeMaster,&reg; a beverage packaging carton. Riverwoods suit sought a preliminary injunction and damages. Application was later made to the court to adjourn the hearing for the purpose of engaging in settlement discussions. This dispute was settled shortly after year end with no material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. II 19 Table of Contents MeadWestvaco is involved in various other litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the currently expected outcome of any matter, lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. Interest rates It is managements objective to manage its interest expense through a blend of fixed and floating interest rate instruments. The company primarily funds itself with long term debt, having final maturities ranging from two to 40 years at date of issue, a portion of which has variable interest rates, and with variable interest rate commercial paper. The company uses interest rate swaps in managing its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Foreign currency The company has foreign based operations, primarily in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Western Europe and Asia, which accounted for approximately 18% of its 2003 net sales. In addition, certain of the companys domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of its foreign operations, the company also makes intercompany sales and receives royalties and dividends denominated in many different currencies. All of this exposes the company to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of the companys domestic operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in the companys financial statements. The companys foreign currency management policy permits it to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations. During 2003, the company entered into foreign currency hedges to partially offset the foreign currency impact of these flows on operating income. The company also issues intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, exposing it to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates at loan issue and loan repayment dates. Generally, management uses forward exchange contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge these exposures. When applied to the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments at December 31, 2003, a 10% adverse change in currency rates would not materially affect the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Contractual obligations The company enters into various contractual obligations throughout the year. Presented below are the contractual obligations of the company as of December 31, 2003, and the time period in which payments under the obligations are due. Disclosures related to long term debt, capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations are included in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements of the company. Also included below are disclosures regarding the amounts due under purchase obligations. Purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. MeadWestvaco has included in the disclosure below, all normal and recurring purchase orders, take or pay contracts, supply arrangements as well as other purchase commitments that management believes meet the definition of purchase obligations above.

Of these amounts, $12 million and $3 million were recorded within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Although these charges related to individual segments, such amounts are reflected in Corporate and other for segment reporting purposes. The following table and discussion presents additional detail of the 2003 charges by business segment: In millions Asset writedowns Employeecosts Inventory writedowns Other costs Total Packaging $ 13 $ 19 $ 2 $ 3 $ 37 Paper 12 12 Consumer and Office Products 1 1 Corporate and other 2 21 23 $ 15 $ 53 $ 2 $ 3 $ 73 Gain on sale of previously written down facilities $ (5 ) $ $ $ $ (5 ) Packaging: During the year, the company wrote down to net realizable value a sawmill and related assets that the company is marketing for sale. The company also recorded employee separation costs of $2 million related to approximately 150 employees associated with the sawmill. Primarily all of these employees have separated from the company as of December 31, 2003. Total charges for these actions were approximately $11 million through December 31, 2003. Also, during the year, the company took actions to streamline its packaging operations through the planned shutdown of packaging converting plants in Richmond, Virginia, Cleveland, Tennessee, and Newark, Delaware. II 21 Table of Contents Approximately 525 employees were affected by the closures and had separated from the company as of December 31, 2003. The total costs associated with the closures were approximately $17 million. Additionally, $2 million of asset writedowns and $7 million of employee separation costs covering about 370 employees were incurred during the year as a result of various other restructuring activities. Approximately one half of the employees affected by these activities have separated from the company as of December 31, 2003, and the remaining are expected to separate in 2004. Paper: As part of the companys planned integration strategy and various restructuring activities, the Paper segment had charges of $12 million for the separation benefits of approximately 160 employees. As of December 31, 2003, many of the affected employees had been separated. The remaining separations are expected to occur by the end of the first half of 2004. In addition, in 2003 the company sold a previously written down facility. As a result of the sale of that facility, the company recorded a gain of $2 million. Consumer and Office Products: During 2003, the company sold a previously written down facility resulting in a gain of $3 million recorded by the company. Corporate and other: As part of the continued review of the businesses and various restructuring activities, including the reorganization of overlapping corporate functions and other business units, the company recorded charges that included $21 million of employee separation benefits covering about 280 employees. Approximately 40% of the employees have separated from the company as of December 31, 2003, and the remaining are expected to separate in 2004. Additionally, a corporate asset that was sold was written down to its estimated fair value, resulting in a charge of $2 million. Year ended December 31, 2002 For the year ended December 31, 2002, MeadWestvaco recorded total pretax restructuring charges and other merger related costs of $153 million. Approximately $75 million and $78 million were recorded within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. The charges were mainly attributable to the shutdown of a paper machine at the Westvaco mill in Luke, Maryland, closure of three consumer and office products envelope plants, the realignment of the consumer packaging operations, and the reorganization of corporate and other business units, principally information technologies, finance, forestry, and purchasing and logistics. As of December 31, 2003, all of the actions related to these charges were complete and the balance of the accruals for employee and other costs were substantially utilized. Although the charges were not recorded as part of segment results, $23 million related to the Packaging segment, $31 million to the Paper segment, $14 million to the Consumer and Office Products segment and $85 million to Corporate and other. Fiscal year ended October 31, 2001 During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, Westvaco recorded total pretax restructuring charges of $57 million, including $55 million within cost of sales and $2 million within selling, general and administrative expenses. The charges were primarily recorded in the fourth quarter and were mainly attributable to the shutdown of a paper mill in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, and realignment of the consumer packaging operations. As of December 31, 2002, all of the actions related to these charges were complete and the balance of the accruals for employee and other costs were utilized. Although the charges were not recorded as part of segment results, $27 million related to the Packaging segment, $29 million to the Paper segment, and $1 million to the Specialty Chemical segment.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes the accounting policies discussed below represent those accounting policies requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to reported results. The companys management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the companys disclosure. Environmental and legal liabilities: The company records accruals for estimated environmental liabilities when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to the probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities as well as availability of insurance coverage and contribution by other potentially responsible parties. Due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments, and changes in governmental regulations and environmental technologies, accruals are subject to substantial uncertainties, and actual costs could be materially greater or less than the estimated amounts. The company records accruals for other legal contingencies when the contingency is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Restructuring and other charges: The company periodically records charges for the reduction of its workforce, the closure of manufacturing facilities and other actions related to business improvement and productivity initiatives. These events require estimates of liabilities for employee separation payments and related benefits, demolition, environmental cleanup and other costs, which could differ from actual costs incurred. II 23 Table of Contents Pension and postretirement benefits: Assumptions used in the determination of pension income and postretirement benefit expense, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and increases in future compensation and medical costs, are evaluated by the company, reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate. Actual asset returns and compensation and medical costs, which are more favorable than assumptions, can have the effect of lowering expense and cash contributions, and, conversely, actual results, which are less favorable than assumptions, could increase expense and cash contributions. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense in such future periods. In 2003, the company recorded pension income before settlements and curtailments of approximately $70 million before taxes compared to $124 million in 2002. The company currently estimates overall pension income in 2004 will be similar to that recorded in 2003 before taxes, which will not have any effect on cash flows. The estimate assumes a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.5% and a discount rate of 6.0% compared to 6.5% in 2003. If the percentage for the expected rate of return on plan assets were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income would change by approximately $17 million. Similarly, if the discount rate were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income would change by approximately $6 million. At December 31, 2003, the aggregate value of pension fund assets had increased to $3.2 billion from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2002, reflecting overall equity market performance. Under current accounting guidelines, if any plans accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the value of the plans assets, an additional minimum liability, with corresponding charges to intangible assets and other comprehensive income, are required to be recorded. While the company does not expect to record an additional minimum liability with regard to its qualified pension plan, if asset values decline to levels below the accumulated benefit obligation, the company would be required to do so. Effective January 1, 2004, the company modified certain postretirement healthcare benefits provided to its future retirees. The impact of these changes will reduce the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $68 million, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the eligible employees. Combined with other demographic changes in the plan, postretirement expense is not expected to change significantly from the $25 million recorded in 2003. Long lived asset: Useful lives: Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based on managements estimates of the periods over which the assets will be productively utilized in the revenue generation process or for other useful purposes. Factors that affect the determination of lives include prior experience with similar assets, product life expectations and industry practices. The determination of useful lives dictates the period over which tangible and intangible long lived assets are depreciated or amortized, typically using the straight line method. Tangible assets: The company reviews long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. The statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review for impairment involves management to predict the estimated cash flows that will be generated by the long lived asset over its remaining estimated useful life. Considerable judgment must be exercised in determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to use in any value computations. Intangible assets: Business acquisitions often result in recording intangible assets, the values of which are often based upon, in part, independent third party appraisals. Like long lived tangible assets, intangible assets are subject to periodic impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As with tangible assets, considerable judgment must be exercised. II 24 Table of Contents Goodwill: Goodwill arises in business combinations when the purchase price of assets acquired exceeds the appraised value. As with tangible and intangible assets, periodic impairment reviews are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. As with impairment reviews of tangible and intangible assets, management uses judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142, the company assessed the value of its goodwill as of January 1, 2002 and determined an impairment charge was warranted. The nature of the charge is discussed in Note D to the consolidated financial statements. The company will review the recorded value of its goodwill annually or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. The review for impairment involves management to predict the estimated cash flows that will be generated by the long lived asset over its remaining estimated useful life. Considerable judgment must be exercised in determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to use in any value computations. Revenue recognition: The company recognizes revenues at the point when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. Substantially all of the companys revenues are generated through product sales, and shipping terms generally indicate when title and the risk of ownership have passed. Revenue is recognized at shipment for sales where shipping terms are FOB (free on board) shipping point. For sales where shipping terms are FOB destination, revenue is recognized when the goods are received by the customer. The company provides for all allowances for estimated returns and other customer credits such as discounts and volume rebates, when the revenue is recognized, based on historical experience, current trends and any notification of pending returns. The customer allowances are in many instances subjective and are determined with significant management judgment and are reviewed regularly to determine the adequacy of the amounts. Changes in economic conditions, markets and customer relationships may require adjustments to these allowances from period to period. Income taxes: Income Taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws. The company evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that it will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment, including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made. The company has operations in tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. In the preparation of the companys financial statements, management exercises judgments in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters. While actual results could vary, in managements judgment the company has adequate accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters. The companys effective tax rate varied greatly throughout the year creating volatility in the quarterly net income (loss) reported by the company. Management is required to make estimates of the companys effective tax rate for the full year each quarter. This estimate includes assumptions about the level of income that will be achieved for the full year in both its domestic and international operations. The forecast of full year earnings includes assumptions about markets in each of our businesses as well as the timing of certain transactions, including forestland sales gains. Should business performance or the timing of certain transactions change during the year, the level of income achieved may not meet the level of income estimated earlier in the year at interim periods. This change in the income levels and mix of earnings can result in significant adjustments to the tax provision in the quarter in which the estimate is refined. II 25 Table of Contents Recently adopted accounting standards Effective January 1, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires that an obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recognized as a liability when incurred. Subsequent to initial measurement, an entity recognizes changes in the amount of the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of estimated cash flows. The adoption of this standard resulted in a cumulative adjustment charge of $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements in this interpretation are required in last years financial statements and the initial measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified beginning on January 1, 2003. This statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after September 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after September 30, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). This statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This statement revises the disclosures required for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The company adopted this revised statement effective December 31, 2003. See Note K to the financial statements for the revised disclosures. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation requires consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support). The interpretation applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. The company adopted FIN No. 46 in the fourth quarter of 2003, and it did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. II 26 Table of Contents In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, corrected copy. This bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the previous interpretative guidance included in Topic 13 in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance related to revenue recognition. The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
