Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) discusses the results of operations and general financial condition of MeadWestvaco. MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. OVERVIEW For the year ended December 31, 2006, MeadWestvaco Corporation (MeadWestvaco or the company) reported net income of $93 million, or $0.52 per share. Net income for the year included after tax restructuring charges of $85 million, or $0.47 per share, related primarily to employee separation costs, facility closures and the permanent shutdown of two previously idled paperboard machines, and after tax one time costs of $26 million, or $0.14 per share, related to the companys cost reduction initiative. Also included in net income for 2006 was an after tax gain of $13 million, or $0.07 per share, on the sale of a note (PIK note) received as part of the consideration for the sale of the printing and writing papers business in 2005, and an after tax gain of $11 million, or $0.06 per share, on the sale of corporate real estate. Comparable amounts for prior periods are noted later in this discussion. The amounts related to the items noted above are reflected in corporate and other for segment reporting purposes. During 2006, the company generated strong revenue growth from higher selling prices and an improved product mix in many of its businesses. In addition, the results for 2006 were favorably impacted from the acquisition of Calmar. These improvements were partially offset by significant inflation in energy and raw material prices. In 2006, the pre tax cost for the principal inputs of energy, raw materials and freight was approximately $159 million higher than in 2005, offsetting improvements in price and mix of $142 million. Cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations grew to $567 million in 2006, compared to $305 million in 2005, reflecting higher earnings and improvements in working capital. MeadWestvacos principal business segments are (i) Packaging Resources, (ii) Consumer Solutions, (iii) Consumer and Office Products, and (iv) Specialty Chemicals. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company completed the change in its management and operating structure such that its previously reported Packaging segment was replaced by the Packaging Resources and Consumer Solutions segments. This segment structure reflects the companys internal reporting to its chief decision makers and aligns the segment disclosure with managements analysis of results of operations and the process utilized to allocate resources. The company has presented its reportable segments for 2005 and 2004 to reflect the new reporting structure adopted in 2006. Also in 2005, the company exited its printing and writing papers business, which is recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. In the Packaging Resources segment, sales in 2006 increased 4% compared to 2005 and segment operating profit increased 18% during the same period. The Packaging Resources segment sales increased primarily as a result of higher selling prices and an improved product mix. Volume in 2006 increased slightly as compared to 2005. Segment operating profit increased in 2006 compared to 2005 as higher selling prices and improved product mix and productivity more than offset higher costs for raw materials, energy and freight. 17 Table of Contents In the Consumer Solutions segment, sales in 2006 increased 7% compared to 2005, but segment operating profit decreased 9% during the same period. The 2006 results include the impact of Calmar, which was acquired in July 2006. Excluding Calmar, segment sales in 2006 decreased 3% compared to 2005. Increased sales in beverage and the positive impact of Calmar offset weaker demand for media packaging. Segment operating profit decreased in 2006 versus 2005 as the positive results from Calmar and the operating profit increases in beverage, personal care and tobacco were more than offset by declines in the media business, and higher energy, freight and other input costs. In the Consumer and Office Products segment, sales in 2006 increased 2% compared to 2005, but segment profits decreased 2% during the same period. Sales in 2006 were positively impacted by improvements in price and mix, partially offset by lower volume due in part to supply chain activities at large office products customers. Segment operating profit decreased slightly in 2006 versus 2005 as improved mix and better performance in the Brazilian school and office products business were offset by higher manufacturing and paper input costs. In the Specialty Chemicals segment, sales in 2006 increased 16% compared to 2005 and operating profit increased by 31% during the same period. Increased sales in 2006 were due to higher selling prices and improved volume in the pine chemical businesses. Sales in the carbon based businesses were flat as U.S. auto manufacturing declined slightly. Segment operating profit increased in 2006 versus 2005 as the positive effects of higher selling prices and lower selling, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by higher input costs for raw materials, principally crude tall oil, which increased significantly from the prior year. In 2005, the company launched a cost reduction initiative to improve the efficiency of our business model. As part of the initiative, we are focusing on reducing the cost structure across the company by redesigning general and administrative services with a plan to move to a more simplified, standardized, global model. We are also reducing our real estate footprint and streamlining our warehousing and logistics network. The goal of this initiative is to reduce the overall cost structure of the company by $175 million to $200 million, before inflation, on an annual run rate basis by the end of 2007. Through 2006, specific actions were completed that resulted in annual run rate savings of about $125 million, before inflation. The company anticipates achieving run rate savings of $175 million to $185 million by the end of 2007 with the remaining balance of the $200 million run rate savings expected to be achieved in 2008; however, the company will look for every opportunity to pull forward more savings into 2007. In February 2006, the company announced plans designed to accelerate progress toward a new packaging platform, create a new center for packaging innovation, and consolidate corporate activities to a new corporate headquarters located in Richmond, Virginia. Through year end, the company made substantial progress in these initiatives by realigning its packaging business into two focused groups, establishing the new innovation center in Raleigh, North Carolina, and completing the corporate consolidation plan. 18 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes our results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). All references to per share amounts are presented on an after tax basis. In millions, except per share data Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 6,530 $ 6,170 $ 6,060 Cost of sales 5,399 5,087 4,925 Selling, general and administrative expenses 905 756 800 Interest expense 211 208 209 Other income, net (83 ) (16 ) (197 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 98 135 323 Income tax provision 5 16 99 Income from continuing operations 93 119 224 Discontinued operations (91 ) (573 ) Net income (loss) $ 93 $ 28 $ (349 ) Income (loss) per share basic: Income from continuing operations $ 0.52 $ 0.62 $ 1.11 Discontinued operations (0.48 ) (2.84 ) Net income (loss) $ 0.52 $ 0.14 $ (1.73 ) Income (loss) per share diluted: Income from continuing operations $ 0.52 $ 0.62 $ 1.10 Discontinued operations (0.48 ) (2.82 ) Net income (loss) $ 0.52 $ 0.14 $ (1.72 ) Sales for the year ended December 31, 2006, were $6.5 billion compared to $6.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $6.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. Increased sales in 2006, compared to 2005, were the result of higher selling prices and improved product mix in many of our businesses, partially offset by weaker demand for certain products compared to 2005. The current year sales include $206 million from the addition of Calmar, which was acquired in July 2006. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information for each segment. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $5.4 billion, compared to $5.1 billion and $4.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our gross margin in 2006 was approximately the same as 2005 and was down about one percentage point from 2004. The decline in gross margin from 2004 was primarily related to increased input costs in 2006 and 2005 for raw materials, energy, and freight and higher market related downtime in 2005. During 2006, the pre tax input cost of energy, raw materials and freight was approximately $159 million higher than in 2005. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $53 million, $18 million and $89 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 19 Table of Contents Maintenance costs and the effects of market related downtime are reflected in cost of sales. Total maintenance costs in 2006 were $234 million, compared to $244 million in 2005 and $242 million in 2004. In 2006, the company took no significant market related downtime, while in 2005 and 2004 the company took 109,000 tons and 17,000 tons of market related downtime which had a negative impact on results of $31 million and $3 million, respectively. In 2005 and 2004, the mix of market related downtime varied by business, but primarily occurred in the Packaging Resources segment. The effects of market related downtime consist of the unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production, but do not include lost profits due to lower shipment levels. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $905 million, $756 million and $800 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 13.9%, 12.3% and 13.2% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Higher expense in 2006 was due primarily to increased restructuring charges and one time costs, the addition of Calmar in July 2006 and higher share based compensation. Restructuring charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $60 million in 2006 and $11 million in both 2005 and 2004. Incremental costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 compared to the prior year included certain one time costs, the addition of Calmar and share based compensation in the amounts of $42 million, $26 million and $15 million, respectively. Additionally, beginning in 2005, about $30 million of certain costs classified as cost of sales, were, in prior years, included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the consumer packaging business, as the company integrated the business and shifted certain functions to production. Pension income for continuing operations, before settlements, curtailments and termination benefits was $50 million in 2006 compared to $67 million in 2005 and $86 million in 2004. Pension income is reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and is reported in corporate and other for segment reporting purposes. Interest expense from continuing operations of $211 million in 2006 was similar to 2005 and 2004 interest expense of $208 million and $209 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to the prior years was the result of the incremental short term borrowings obtained in connection with the Calmar acquisition. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, interest expense associated with the companys papers business, which was sold in the second quarter of 2005, was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations in the amount of $20 million and $69 million, respectively. Other income, net, was $83 million in 2006, compared to $16 million and $197 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gains on the sale of forestland were $29 million, $60 million and $176 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, the company recorded gains on the sale of corporate real estate of $18 million and gain on the sale of a PIK note of $21 million, as well as a loss of $20 million on asset impairments. The results for 2006 and 2005 include transition services income of $5 million and $25 million, respectively, related to the services provided to NewPage. The results for 2005 include a loss on extinguishment of debt of $90 million related to the company reducing debt by approximately $1 billion. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or (losses) of its equity method investments, before other than temporary impairments, was $(6) million, $(4) million and $2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other items, including interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses, netted to income of $36 million, $25 million and $19 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 20 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the companys annual effective tax rate was approximately 5%, 12% and 31%, respectively. The decline in the rate for 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to a shift in the level and mix of domestic versus foreign earnings. The decline in the rate for 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a lower proportion of domestic earnings in 2005, a change in the allocation of state taxes as a result of the sale of the printing and writing papers business, and tax credits. Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other. Packaging Resources In millions Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Sales $ 2,953 $ 2,836 Segment profit1 275 234 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Packaging Resources segment produces bleached paperboard, Coated Natural Kraft&reg; paperboard (CNK), kraft paperboard, linerboard and saturating kraft, and packaging for consumer products markets including packaging for media, beverage and dairy, cosmetics, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and health care products. This segments products are manufactured at four domestic mills and two mills located in Brazil. Bleached paperboard is used for packaging high value consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tobacco, food service, media products and aseptic cartons. CNK paperboard is used for a range of packaging applications, the largest of which for MeadWestvaco is multi pack beverage packaging. Kraft paperboard is used for folding carton applications. Linerboard is used in the manufacture of corrugated boxes and containers. Saturating kraft is used in the manufacture of decorative laminates for kitchen countertops, furniture, flooring, wall panels, as well as pad stock for electronic components. Sales in the Packaging Resources segment increased to $3.0 billion in 2006, compared to $2.8 billion in 2005. The sales increase of 4% for 2006 over 2005 was a result of higher selling prices realized and strengthening demand for many products. Product mix improvement also favorably impacted sales in 2006. Shipments of bleached paperboard in 2006 were 1,646,000 tons, down 2% from the prior year, reflecting the permanent shutdown of two machines in 2006. Shipments of CNK in 2006 were 1,082,000 tons, up 4% from 2005. Shipments of unbleached paperboard in 2006 were 838,000 tons, down 2% from the 21 Table of Contents prior year, reflecting the intentional shift away from less profitable products. Compared to 2005, bleached paperboard prices in 2006 were up 3%, CNK open market prices were up 3% and unbleached paperboard prices were up 9%. Sales of the companys Brazilian packaging operation, Rigesa Ltda., increased 8% in 2006 over 2005 driven by improved mix and improved volume, partially offset by lower prices. Segment profit for 2006 increased to $275 million compared to $234 million in 2005. The 18% improvement reflects improvements in pricing, volume and mix and productivity, partially offset by higher prices for raw materials and energy. Earnings in 2006 benefited by $54 million from price increases and mix improvements, $5 million from volume improvement and $70 million from favorable cost productivity. Earnings for 2006 were negatively affected by $77 million from higher input costs for energy, wood and freight and from $11 million in other operating cost increases compared to the prior year. The prior year results reflect the impact of higher market related downtime and the impact of two hurricanes. Consumer Solutions In millions Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Sales $ 2,170 $ 2,021 Segment profit1 93 102 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Consumer Solutions segment offers a full range of converting and consumer packaging solutions including printed plastic packaging and injection molded products used for packaging media products such as DVDs and CDs; cosmetics and pharmaceutical products; and plastic dispensing and spraying systems for personal care, healthcare, fragrance and lawn and garden markets. This segment designs and produces multi pack cartons and packaging systems primarily for the beverage take home market and packaging for the tobacco market. Paperboard and plastic are converted into packaging products at plants located in North America, Brazil, Asia and Europe. In addition, this segment manufactures equipment that is leased or sold to its beverage and dairy customers to package their products. Sales in the Consumer Solutions segment increased 7% to $2.2 billion in 2006, compared to $2.0 billion in 2005. Sales for 2006 include the results of Calmar, acquired in the third quarter of 2006. Excluding the impact of Calmar, sales in 2006 declined 3% as compared to 2005. Sales improved slightly for our beverage business, but declined for other specialty packaging lines. Sales were particularly weak for media as demand for music packaging declined, game volumes decreased due to delayed next generation console releases and the absence of DVD packaging business for the years blockbuster filmed entertainment titles. 22 Table of Contents Segment operating profit for 2006 decreased 9% to $93 million, compared to $102 million in 2005. Earnings benefits from the acquisition of Calmar, improved results in our beverage, personal care and tobacco businesses and certain cost improvements were offset by $6 million in higher input costs for energy and freight, $7 million in volume decreases, $5 million in unfavorable price and mix and $19 million in higher other material and operating costs compared to the prior year. Consumer and Office Products In millions Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Sales $ 1,143 $ 1,125 Segment profit1 127 130 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Consumer and Office Products segment manufactures, sources, markets and distributes school and office products, time management products and envelopes to retailers and commercial distributors. This segments operations are conducted predominantly in North America and Brazil. Sales for this segment increased slightly to $1.14 billion in 2006, compared to $1.13 billion for 2005. The 2% sales growth from 2005 reflects solid performance in the segments value added branded consumer product lines, improved overall mix and a solid performance in the Brazilian school products business partially offset by customers shortening their supply chain, which caused sales delays in certain products into the first quarter of 2007. Year over year operating profit was down $3 million in 2006 compared to the prior year. Results in 2006 were positively impacted by $45 million from price increases and mix improvements, offset by the negative impact of higher input and operating costs of $35 million and volume decreases of $13 million. This segments operating profit continues to be impacted by low priced Asian imports. Specialty Chemicals In millions Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Sales $ 493 $ 425 Segment profit1 51 39 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures, markets and distributes specialty chemicals derived from sawdust and byproducts of the papermaking process. Products include, but are not limited to, activated carbon used in emission control systems for automobiles and trucks, printing ink resins, and emulsifiers used in asphalt paving and dyestuffs. 23 Table of Contents Sales increased in 2006 to a record $493 million from $425 million in 2005 due to higher selling prices and strong demand for the segments industrial pine chemicals used in asphalt paving, dyes and proprietary publication ink resins and other industrial markets. Year over year volumes for carbon based products were essentially flat due to lower automobile production volumes in North America. Increased segment operating profit reflects the positive effects of pricing and volume of $50 million and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses of $4 million, partially offset by higher prices of $42 million for raw materials, principally crude tall oil, freight and energy. Corporate and other In millions Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Sales $ 219 $ 213 Corporate and other loss 1 (448 ) (370 ) 1 Corporate and other loss may include goodwill impairment charges, minority interest, debt retirement charges, restructuring charges and one time costs, net pension income, interest income and expense, and gains on asset sales. Corporate and other includes the companys specialty paper business, forestry operations and corporate support staff services, and related assets and liabilities. The results also include income and expense items not directly associated with segment operations, such as certain legal charges and settlements, restructuring and one time charges, pension income, interest income and expense, and other charges. The loss for corporate and other was $448 million in 2006, compared to a loss of $370 million in 2005. The higher loss in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of higher restructuring charges of $104 million, lower gains on forestland sales of $31 million, lower transition service income from NewPage of $20 million, lower pension income of $17 million, one time costs in 2006 of $42 million, offset by debt retirement charges of $90 million in 2005, the gain from the sale of the PIK note of $21 million in 2006, gains on the sale of corporate real estate of $18 million in 2006 and lower other costs of $7 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 The information in the discussion below has been restated on a continuing operations basis and to reflect the new segment reporting structure adopted in 2006. Discontinued Operations In connection with the sale of the companys printing and writing papers business that occurred in 2005, the company recorded an after tax loss from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $91 million and $573 million, respectively. Results in 2005 and 2004 were negatively impacted by sale related costs, including lease termination charges, asset 24 Table of Contents impairments, debt extinguishment costs, pension settlement and curtailment losses, and other related costs included in discontinued operations. Packaging Resources In millions Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Sales $ 2,836 $ 2,754 Segment profit1 234 270 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Sales in 2005 for the Packaging Resources segment increased 3% compared to 2004, while segment earnings decreased 13%. Revenue in the mill based business, compared to the prior year, was impacted by a decline in shipments of bleached paperboard as a result of the impact of two hurricanes. Bleached paperboard shipments of 1.7 million tons were down 7% from 2004, while the business realized a year over year net price improvement of about 5% across the bleached paperboard grades. Shipments of CNK paperboard of over one million tons were similar to shipments in 2004, with open market pricing increases of 3% over the prior year. Linerboard shipments increased 17% from 2004, with pricing similar to the prior year. The companys Brazilian packaging operation, Rigesa Ltda., had an increase in sales in 2005 over 2004 driven by higher prices and a stronger Brazilian currency. The decline in segment earnings in 2005 reflects significantly higher input costs for raw materials and energy, higher market related downtime and the impact of two hurricanes. Consumer Solutions In millions Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Sales $ 2,021 $ 2,030 Segment profit1 102 161 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Sales in 2005 for the Consumer Solutions segment were slightly less than in 2004, and segment earnings decreased 37%. This segment reported lower sales growth of print and plastic packaging for the media and entertainment industries, but increased demand for cosmetics and tobacco packaging in Europe. In the beverage packaging business, sales in 2005 were down compared to 2004 due to weaker soft drink demand in Northern America and weaker demand in beer markets worldwide. A weaker euro had a negative impact on sales for the European operations. The positive impact of improved volume and mix in tobacco and cosmetics packaging in Europe was offset by weaker volume in media and entertainment packaging as a result of a lack of blockbuster titles in 2005, weakness and some share loss in games, DVD and music markets, and increased resin costs that could not be passed on to customers. Operating profit in 2005 was positively impacted by growth in nonbeverage dairy packaging from our European acquisition in 2004. 25 Table of Contents Consumer and Office Products In millions Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Sales $ 1,125 $ 1,090 Segment profit1 130 137 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Sales in 2005 for the Consumer and Office Products segment were up 3%, driven by 2004 acquisitions and improved demand for time management products, offset in part by global competitive pressures from lower priced Asian based imports, especially related to commodity based paper products. Sales and operating profit in 2005 benefited from the addition of the Brazilian school and office products business acquired in 2004, additional contribution from the segments Canadian business and cost savings from facility consolidations made in 2004. Segment profit was negatively impacted by Asian import price pressures and higher raw material input costs, primarily uncoated paper, which could not be fully passed on to customers in 2005. Year over year profit results were positively impacted by $25 million from price increases and mix improvements, and $2 million from other cost reductions; offset by the negative impact of higher input costs of $26 million and volume decreases of $8 million. Specialty Chemicals In millions Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Sales $ 425 $ 410 Segment profit1 39 57 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Sales in 2005 for the Specialty Chemicals segment increased 4% from 2004, while operating profit declined 32%. Sales in 2005 were higher primarily as a result of higher selling prices and strong demand for the segments chemicals used in asphalt paving, dyes, printing inks and industrial pine chemical markets. These positive effects were offset by lower volumes for some activated carbon products as a result of changes in design of emission systems by an automaker customer. Higher raw material and energy input costs were the primary drivers of the decline in the segments operating profit compared to 2004. Year over year profit results were positively impacted by price increases and mix improvements of $15 million, offset by the negative impact of higher costs for raw materials and energy of $23 million, volume decreases of $6 million, and other cost increases of $4 million. 26 Table of Contents Corporate and other In millions Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Sales $ 213 $ 216 Corporate and other loss 1 (370 ) (302 ) 1 Corporate and other loss may include goodwill impairment charges, minority interest, debt retirement charges, restructuring charges and one time costs, net pension income, interest income and expense, and gains on asset sales. The loss for corporate and other was $370 million in 2005, compared to a loss of $302 million in 2004. The increase in the loss reflects lower forestland sales gains in 2005 of $116 million, lower pension income of $17 million, and higher debt retirement cost of $89 million. These negative effects were partially offset by $71 million of lower restructuring charges in 2005, higher transition services income of $25 million, higher interest income of $21 million, reduced corporate spending of $33 million, and lower other costs of $4 million. Other items Selling, general and administrative expenses were $756 million in 2005 compared to $800 million in 2004. A portion of the decrease in 2005 was a result of various activities which focused on reduced spending and staff reductions throughout the company. Selling, general and administrative expenses included $11 million of restructuring charges in both 2005 and 2004. Interest expense of $208 million in 2005 was similar to interest expense of $209 million in 2004. Pension income for continuing operations, before settlements and curtailments, was $67 million before taxes in 2005 compared to $86 million in 2004, reflecting the companys continued overfunded position in its qualified plans. Other income, net, decreased in 2005 to $16 million from $197 million in 2004. Included in other income, net, in 2005 are gains on the sales of forestlands of $60 million compared to $176 million in 2004. Debt retirement costs were $89 million higher in 2005, offset by higher transition service income of $25 million. The companys annual effective tax benefit rate for 2005 was 12% compared to 31% in 2004. The decrease in the 2005 annual effective tax rate reflects a lower proportion of domestic earnings in 2005, a change in the allocation of state taxes as a result of the sale of the printing and writing papers business, and tax credits. 27 Table of Contents Outlook Packaging Resources MeadWestvacos Packaging Resources groups high quality paperboard products are marketed globally. Overall demand remains solid relative to the seasonally weaker first calendar quarter. The company continues to experience steady order levels from its key lines of business, which include global tobacco, beverage and aseptic applications. As such, the companys focus is on realizing price increases to offset continued historically high costs for raw materials, energy and freight. The company also is focusing on continuing to improve its productivity by consolidating its customer service and by pursuing other global supply chain initiatives, including enhancing transportation efficiency and optimizing its warehouse footprint. Any achieved benefits are expected to help further offset historically high input cost inflation. Throughout the year, outages for routine maintenance are planned, with two such outages scheduled for the bleached paperboard system in the first quarter of 2007. Future outages will be communicated in a timely fashion by the company through its periodic broad disclosures with the investment community. Consumer Solutions In 2006, overall profitability in MeadWestvacos Consumer Solutions segment was below the companys expectations. In 2007, the company has broadly communicated a profit improvement plan for this business, which includes optimizing its manufacturing capacity, refocusing its media business on higher value specialty packaging for music, DVDs and games, eliminating operating redundancies and enhancing materials procurement through the companys shared services function. MeadWestvaco expects to demonstrate meaningful year over year operating profit improvement beginning in the second half of 2007 as it executes the aforementioned plan and continues to generate strong growth and profitability in the companys global dispensing and spraying systems business that targets the personal care, healthcare, fragrance and lawn and garden markets. The company also plans to expand its current operations in China and enter other emerging markets, including India, which is expected to require modest investments in capital and in selling, general and administrative functions. Consumer & Office Products The Consumer and Office Products segment historically incurs a small loss in the first calendar quarter as the business builds inventory for its back to school selling season in the second and third quarters and for the peak selling season for time management products in the second half of the year. Price and mix improvements from the companys branded consumer product lines are expected to be partially offset by continued high costs for uncoated paper, the segments principal raw material. In addition, supply chain activities by major customers and unpredictable order patterns for the companys back to school and time management products may distort segment operating profit quarter to quarter. 28 Table of Contents Specialty Chemicals In 2007, global demand for MeadWestvacos pine chemicals, including proprietary ink resins, asphalt emulsifiers, rosin and other industrial pine based chemicals, is expected to remain solid. However, costs for crude tall oil, the principal input for pine chemical products, are expected to largely offset increases in selling prices. The company also will continue to seek growth opportunities for its carbon technology through new products and geographic expansion to offset continued U.S. auto declines. Cost initiative and restructuring activities As part of its $200 million cost initiative, MeadWestvaco achieved through 2006 annual run rate savings of about $125 million, before inflation. The company anticipates achieving cumulative run rate savings of $175 million to $185 million by the end of 2007 with the balance of the $200 million expected to be achieved in 2008. The company will, however, look for every opportunity to pull forward more savings into 2007. The key components of the 2007 reduction will be the continued execution of our North American shared services platform, IT reduction and supply chain improvement. In February 2006, the company announced plans designed to accelerate progress toward a new packaging platform, create a new innovation center, and consolidate corporate activities to a new corporate headquarters located in Richmond, Virginia. Through year end, the company made substantial progress in these initiatives by realigning its packaging business into two focused groups, establishing the new innovation center in Raleigh, North Carolina, and completing the corporate consolidation plan. The resulting operational efficiencies, customer focus and market driven product innovation will strengthen our position in the packaging industry. The changes began in the second quarter of 2006 and are expected to be completed by early 2007. As part of these initiatives and the planned restructure and realignment of the companys consumer solutions business, the company expects to incur between $50 million and $75 million in restructuring charges and other related costs in 2007. Other items Capital spending was $302 million in 2006 and is expected to increase to $360 million in 2007 due to the addition of Calmar, expansion initiatives into emerging markets, and capital requirements for safety and energy related projects. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $517 million in 2006 and is expected to be about $525 million in 2007. Interest expense totaled $211 million in 2006. Management expects interest expense to be in the range of $210 million to $215 million in 2007. Management currently estimates overall pension income in 2007 to be approximately $53 million which is derived primarily from the domestic plans. This estimate assumes a discount rate of 5.75%, a salary increase rate of 4.0% and an expected rate of return on assets of 8.5%. 29 Table of Contents Land sales The company generated gross proceeds of $30 million and $68 million from the sales of forestland in 2006 and 2005, respectively. On January 31, 2007, the company announced plans to sell approximately 300,000 acres of its forestlands throughout West Virginia, Alabama and Georgia. The company expects to complete the sales during 2007. The land sales include 82,000 acres in Alabama, 145,000 acres in Georgia, and 63,000 acres in West Virginia, and will continue to function as forestland under new ownership. The company will work with potential buyers to ensure that the land continues to be managed sustainably through the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). MeadWestvaco will retain strategic fiber supply agreements to support its mills in Alabama and Virginia. Additional plans are being finalized to further maximize value from our forestlands.

Refer to the Forward looking Statements section later in this document. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash generated from operations provided the major source of funds for the company in 2006. The primary use of funds in 2006 was the acquisition of Calmar, a leading global manufacturer of high quality and innovative plastic dispensing and spraying systems. As disclosed in Note P of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, the purchase price for Calmar was $714 million, of which $374 million was paid in cash and the remaining $340 million was financed through commercial paper borrowings. Of the $340 million in initial borrowings, approximately $190 million was paid down as of December 31, 2006. During 2005, proceeds of $2.2 billion from the sale of nonstrategic assets provided a major source of funds for the company. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $156 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $297 million at December 31, 2005. Operating activities Cash provided by continuing operations was $567 million in 2006, compared to $305 million in 2005 and $633 million in 2004. The increase in operating cash flow in 2006 was primarily attributable to cash provided by changes in working capital of $129 million in 2006, compared to cash used by changes in working capital in 2005 of $271 million. Included in 2005 cash flow from working capital changes was approximately $160 million in tax payments related to the sale of the printing and writing papers business. See Note Q of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion relating to changes in current assets and liabilities. Net income from continuing operations was $93 million, $119 million and $224 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There was no cash flow from discontinued operations in 2006, compared to cash used by discontinued operations of $78 million in 2005 and cash provided by discontinued operations of $289 million in 2004. 30 Table of Contents Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $761 million in 2006, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $2 billion in 2005 and cash used in investing activities of $207 million in 2004. The primary use of funds in 2006 was the acquisition of Calmar for $714 million, while the primary source of the funds in 2005 was proceeds of $2.2 billion from the sale of the printing and writing papers business. Capital spending totaled $302 million in 2006, compared to $305 million in 2005 and $317 million in 2004. Management anticipates that capital spending will be about $360 million in 2007. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is expected to be about $525 million in 2007. During 2006, we acquired Calmar, a leading global manufacturer of high quality and innovative plastic dispensing and spraying systems, with manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. During 2005, we acquired DZN, The Design Group, a full service design and marketing company which will enhance MeadWestvacos package design capabilities, enabling the company to provide a more competitive and comprehensive set of creative design services. During 2004, we acquired Aries Packaging, a machinery systems company which supports the companys dairy packaging systems business in Europe, and Tilibra, a manufacturer of school, office and time management stationery products in Brazil. Asset sales, including the sales of forestlands, generated $165 million of proceeds in 2006 compared to $109 million in 2005 and $281 million in 2004. Proceeds of the sale of a debt security generated $109 million of cash in 2006. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $35 million during 2006, compared to cash used in financing activities of $2.2 billion during 2005 and $672 million during 2004. In 2005, proceeds received from the sale of the companys printing and writing papers business were used to retire approximately $1 billion in debt and to repurchase approximately 24 million shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of $700 million. All of the repurchased shares of common stock were retired. In October 2005, the companys Board of Directors authorized the future repurchase of an additional five million shares primarily to avoid dilution of earnings per share relating to employee equity awards. In 2006, the company repurchased and retired 1.3 million shares, related to an obligation under a share put option to the former owner of a subsidiary. The cash impact of this transaction was approximately $47 million. The 1.3 million shares repurchased under the put option were not a reduction of the share repurchases authorized by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2006, the company had a $750 million bank credit facility that expires in December 2010. Borrowings under this agreement can be in unsecured domestic or eurodollar notes and at rates approximating prime or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at the companys option. The $750 million credit agreement contains a financial covenant limiting the percentage of total debt to total capitalization (including deferred taxes) to 55% as well as certain other covenants with which the company is in compliance. The companys commercial paper program is supported by its $750 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn at December 31, 2006. The company had $148 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006. 31 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the company had $211 million and $13 million of notes payable and current maturities of long term debt. There were $148 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006, and no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The maximum amounts of combined commercial paper outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, were $355 million, $115 million and $53 million, respectively. The average amount of commercial paper outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $136 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively, with an average interest rate of 5.5%, 3.1% and 1.4%, respectively. In the past, these borrowings funded seasonal increases in inventory and receivables at the companys Packaging Resources, Consumer Solutions and Consumer and Office Products segments. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 22% and 15% of the companys debt was variable rate, after factoring in the company interest rate swaps, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the companys variable rate debt was approximately 5.3% in 2006, compared to 4.9% in 2005. The percentage of debt to total capital was 42.2% and 41.1% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the period from January 1, 2007 to February 1, 2007, the holders of the companys 6.84% debentures, due 2037, were entitled to elect early repayment, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount outstanding. Holders elected early repayment of $45 million, which will be paid by the company on March 1, 2007, and the repayment amount is included in current maturities of long term debt as of December 31, 2006. In 2006, the Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.92 per share, paying a total of $167 million of dividends to shareholders in 2006. During 2005 and 2004, the company paid $178 million and $186 million, respectively, of dividends to shareholders. On January 23, 2007, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share payable on March 1, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 2, 2007. Effects of inflation Prices for energy, including natural gas, oil and electricity, and input costs for certain raw materials and freight, increased significantly in 2006 and 2005. The increase in these costs affected many of the companys businesses. During 2006, the pre tax input cost of energy, raw materials and freight was approximately $159 million higher than in 2005. During 2005, the pre tax input cost of energy, raw materials and freight was approximately $150 million higher than in 2004. Environmental and legal matters Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over foreign operations of the company. Due to changes in environmental laws and regulations, the application of such regulations, and changes in environmental control technology, it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes. Taking these uncertainties into account, we estimate that we will incur 32 Table of Contents approximately $19 million in environmental capital expenditures in 2007 and approximately $27 million in 2008. Approximately $34 million was spent on environmental capital projects in 2006. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) or by various state or local governments that we may be liable under federal environmental laws or under applicable state or local laws with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances at sites previously operated or used by the company. The company is currently named as a potentially responsible party (PRP), or has received third party requests for contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state or local laws with respect to numerous sites. There are other sites which may contain contamination or which may be potential Superfund sites, but for which MeadWestvaco has not received any notice or claim. The potential liability for all these sites will depend upon several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, insurance coverage and contribution by other PRPs. The company regularly evaluates its potential liability at these various sites. At December 31, 2006, MeadWestvaco had recorded liabilities of approximately $22 million for estimated potential cleanup costs based upon its close monitoring of ongoing activities and its past experience with these matters. The company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with these sites may exceed amounts of recorded liabilities by an amount that could range from an insignificant amount to as much as $20 million. This estimate is less certain than the estimate upon which the environmental liabilities were based. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. As with numerous other large industrial companies, the company has been named a defendant in asbestos related personal injury litigation. Typically, these suits also name many other corporate defendants. All of the claims against the company resolved to date have been concluded before trial, either through dismissal or through settlement with payments to the plaintiff that are not material to the company. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, have not been significant. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately 350 lawsuits. Management believes that the company has substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. The company has valid defenses to these claims and intends to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on its historical experience in asbestos cases and an analysis of the current cases, the company believes that it has adequate amounts accrued for potential settlements and judgments in asbestos related litigation. At December 31, 2006, the company had recorded litigation liabilities of approximately $22 million, a significant portion of which relates to asbestos. Should the volume of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that the company could incur significant costs resolving these cases. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. 33 Table of Contents The company is involved in various other litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the currently expected outcome of any matter, lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. Contractual obligations The company enters into various contractual obligations throughout the year. Presented below are the contractual obligations of the company as of December 31, 2006, and the time period in which payments under the obligations are due. Disclosures related to long term debt, capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations are included in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements of the company. Also included below are disclosures regarding the amounts due under purchase obligations. Purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The company has included in the disclosure below all normal and recurring purchase orders, take or pay contracts, supply arrangements as well as other purchase commitments that management believes meet the definition of purchase obligations above.

It is expected that the lease commencement date will be in the third quarter of 2009, after about a two year construction period. The annual minimum rental payments associated with this agreement, which will depend largely in part on the final cost of the facility and the amount of square footage leased, are estimated to be between $9 million and $10 million, beginning in the second half of 2009. The estimated minimum 34 Table of Contents lease payments associated with this agreement are not included in the above table, as such table reflects contractual obligations entered into by the company on or before December 31, 2006. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS Restructuring charges Year ended December 31, 2006 For the year ended December 31, 2006, MeadWestvaco recorded total pre tax charges of $133 million for asset writedowns, facility closures and employee separation costs, of which $53 million, $60 million and $20 million were recorded within cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other income, net, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2006 the company recorded total pretax charges of $53 million of which $16 million, $26 million and $11 million were recorded within cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other income, net, respectively. Although these charges related to individual segments, such amounts are reflected in corporate and other for segment reporting purposes. The following table and discussion present additional detail of the 2006 charges by business segment: In millions Assetwritedowns and other costs Employeecosts Total Packaging Resources $ 25 $ 2 $ 27 Consumer Solutions 5 25 30 Consumer and Office Products 4 4 8 All other 49 19 68 $ 83 $ 50 $ 133 Packaging Resources: During the year, the company incurred charges of $27 million for asset writedowns, employee separation costs and various other restructuring activities in its packaging operations in the U.S. The charges included employee separation costs of $2 million related to approximately 40 employees.

Consumer Solutions: During the year, the company incurred charges of $30 million for asset writedowns, employee separation costs and other restructuring costs related to the closing of a packaging converting plant in the U.S. and various other restructuring activities in its packaging converting operations in the U.S. and Europe. The charges include separation costs of $25 million related to approximately 860 employees. The majority of the affected employees had separated from the company by December 31, 2006, and the remaining 35 Table of Contents employees will be separated by the end of 2007. The remaining $5 million included asset writedowns and other facility closure related costs. Consumer and Office Products: During the year, the company incurred charges of $8 million for asset writedowns, employee separation costs and other restructuring costs incurred in connection with various restructuring activities in its consumer and office products manufacturing operations in North America. The charges included employee separation costs of $4 million, related to approximately 150 employees, and $4 million for asset writedowns including asset impairments and other costs. The majority of the affected employees had separated from the company by December 31, 2006, and the remaining employees will be separated by the end of 2007. All other: During the year, the company also recorded charges of approximately $19 million related to employee separation costs covering approximately 290 employees. The majority of the affected employees had separated from the company by December 31, 2006, and the remaining employees will be separated by the end of 2007. Additionally, the company incurred charges of $49 million in connection with asset impairments, charges associated with ceased use facilities and a write down of an equity investment. Year ended December 31, 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2005, MeadWestvaco recorded total pre tax charges of $29 million for asset writedowns, facility closures and employee separation costs, of which $18 million and $11 million were recorded within cost of sales and selling, general and administration expenses, respectively. Of these charges, $9 million related to the companys productivity initiative and $20 million related to its cost initiative. These charges included the closing of a Consumer Solutions converting plant in the United States and various other restructuring activities in the Packaging Resources, Consumer Solutions and Consumer and Office Products operations in the United States and Europe, including asset impairments and employee separation costs covering approximately 300 employees. The company also recorded employee separation charges of $6 million in corporate and other covering approximately 190 employees.

The charges related primarily to the closing of a domestic packaging systems plant and 36 Table of Contents various consolidation activities in the companys packaging facilities, primarily in Europe; actions taken to consolidate the consumer and office products operations in North America and close several facilities; and the reorganization of corporate functions and other business units. As of December 31, 2005, all of the actions related to these charges were complete, and the accruals for employee and other costs were substantially utilized. Although the charges were not recorded as part of segment results, $1 million related to the Packaging Resources segment, $38 million to the Consumer Solutions segment, $45 million to the Consumer and Office Products segment, and $16 million to corporate and other. Additionally, in 2004, the company sold a previously written down corporate asset, resulting in a gain of $2 million. Acquisition On July 5, 2006, the company completed its acquisition of Calmar from Compagnie de Saint Gobain. Calmar is a leading global manufacturer of high quality and innovative plastic dispensing and spraying systems, with manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. The business generates sales in 43 countries and employs approximately 2,700 people worldwide. The base purchase price at the date of acquisition was $710 million in cash in exchange for the stock of various Calmar entities, and was subject to adjustment for cash received, debt assumed and certain minor items. Excluding cash acquired, the adjusted purchase price including direct transaction costs was $714 million. The results of Calmar are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date and are included in the companys Consumer Solutions segment. Discontinued operations In connection with the sale of the companys printing and writing papers business that occurred in 2005, the company recorded an after tax loss from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $91 million and $573 million, respectively. Results in 2005 and 2004 were negatively impacted by sale related costs, including lease termination charges, asset impairments, debt extinguishment costs, pension settlement and curtailment losses, and other related costs included in discontinued operations. 37 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our principal accounting policies are described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Financial Statements filed with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes the accounting policies discussed below represent those accounting policies requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to reported results. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the companys disclosure. Environmental and legal liabilities: We record accruals for estimated environmental liabilities when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to the probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as availability of insurance coverage and contribution by other potentially responsible parties. Due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments, and changes in governmental regulations and environmental technologies, accruals are subject to substantial uncertainties, and actual costs could be materially greater or less than the estimated amounts. We record accruals for other legal contingencies, which are also subject to numerous uncertainties and variables associated with assumptions and judgments, when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Liabilities recorded for claims are limited to pending cases based on the companys historical experience, consultation with outside counsel and consultation with an actuarial specialist concerning the feasibility of reasonably estimating liabilities associated with claims that may arise in the future. We recognize insurance recoveries when collection is reasonably assured. Restructuring and other charges: We periodically record charges for the reduction of our workforce, the closure of manufacturing facilities and other actions related to business improvement and productivity initiatives. These events require estimates of liabilities for employee separation payments and related benefits, demolition, environmental cleanup and other costs, which could differ from actual costs incurred. Pension and postretirement benefits: In August 2006, the President signed into law the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). The PPA establishes new minimum funding rules for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. The company does not anticipate any required funding to the U.S. qualified retirement plans in the foreseeable future as a result of this legislation and due to the overfunded status of the plans. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in its balance sheet and to recognize the changes in the 38 Table of Contents plans funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the change occurs. These provisions of the Statement are effective as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its fiscal year end, which is consistent with the companys measurement date. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 was an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the amount of $57 million, net of tax, which principally represents the impact of recognizing previously unrecognized prior service cost and net actuarial losses. Assumptions used in the determination of net pension cost and postretirement benefit expense, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and increases in future compensation and medical costs, are evaluated by the company, reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate. Actual asset returns and compensation and medical costs, which are more favorable than assumptions, can have the effect of lowering expense and cash contributions, and, conversely, actual results, which are less favorable than assumptions, could increase expense and cash contributions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense in such future periods. In 2006, the company recorded pre tax pension income for continuing operations, before settlements, curtailments and termination benefits, of $50 million compared to $67 million in 2005. The company currently estimates overall pre tax pension income in 2007 will increase by approximately $3 million, primarily attributable to an increase in the discount rate. The estimate assumes a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.50%, and a discount rate of 5.75%. If the expected rate of return on plan assets were to change by .5%, annual pension income in 2007 would change by approximately $38 million. Similarly, if the discount rate were to change by .5%, annual pension income would change by approximately $36 million. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate value of pension fund assets had increased to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting overall equity market performance. Prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses in the retirement and postretirement benefit plans subject to amortization are amortized over the average remaining service periods, which are about 11 years and 6 years, respectively, and are a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. In 2004, the company modified certain postretirement healthcare benefits to be provided to future retirees. This change reduced the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $68 million, and is being amortized over the remaining life of the eligible employees, which is approximately 24 years. Long lived assets Useful lives: Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based on managements estimates of the periods over which the assets will be productively utilized in the revenue generation process or for other useful purposes. Factors that affect the determination of lives include prior experience with similar assets, product life expectations and industry practices. The determination of useful lives dictates the period over which tangible and intangible long lived assets are depreciated or amortized, typically using the straight line method. 39 Table of Contents Tangible assets: We review long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. The statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review for impairment involves management to predict the estimated cash flows that will be generated by the long lived asset over its remaining estimated useful life. Considerable judgment must be exercised as to determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to use in any value computations. Intangible assets: Business acquisitions often result in recording intangible assets. Intangible assets are recognized at the time of an acquisition, based upon their fair value. Similar to long lived tangible assets, intangible assets are subject to periodic impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As with tangible assets, considerable judgment must be exercised. Goodwill: Goodwill arises in business combinations when the purchase price of assets acquired exceeds the appraised value. As with tangible and other intangible assets, periodic impairment reviews are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. As with its review of impairment of tangible and intangible assets, management uses judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment. We will review the recorded value of our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. The review for impairment involves management to predict the estimated cash flows that will be generated by the long lived asset over its remaining estimated useful life. Considerable judgment must be exercised in determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to be used in any value computations. Revenue recognition: We recognize revenue at the point when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through product sales, and shipping terms generally indicate when title and the risk of ownership have passed. Revenue is recognized at shipment for sales when shipping terms are FOB (free on board) shipping point. For sales where shipping terms are FOB destination, revenue is recognized when the goods are received by the customer. We provide for all allowances for estimated returns and other customer credits such as discounts and volume rebates, when the revenue is recognized, based on historical experience, current trends and any notification of pending returns. The customer allowances are, in many instances, subjective and are determined with significant management judgment and are reviewed regularly to determine the adequacy of the amounts. Changes in economic conditions, markets and customer relationships may require adjustments to these allowances from period to period. Also included in net sales is service revenue which is recognized as the service is performed. Revenue is recognized for leased equipment to customers on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the lease and is included in net sales of the company. Income taxes: Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which recognizes 40 Table of Contents deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws. We evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment, including the forecast of future taxable income and the valuation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made. The company has tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. In the preparation of the companys financial statements, management exercises judgments in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters. While actual results could vary, in managements judgment, the company has adequate accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters. Each quarter, management must estimate our effective tax rate for the full year. This estimate includes assumptions about the level of income that will be achieved for the full year in both our domestic and international operations. The forecast of full year earnings includes assumptions about markets in each of our businesses as well as the timing of certain transactions, including forestland sales gains and restructuring charges. Should business performance or the timing of certain transactions change during the year, the level of income achieved may not meet the level of income estimated earlier in the year at interim periods. This change in the income levels and mix of earnings can result in significant adjustments to the tax provision in the quarter in which the estimate is refined. New accounting standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004 (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R are required to be applied no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. The company adopted SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method. This Statement requires the recognition of compensation expense when an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions. Under this new Statement, pre tax share based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $21 million, including the incremental pre tax cost of $10 million, relating to stock options and stock appreciation rights. The incremental impact was a reduction to net income of $6 million, or earnings per share of $0.03, net of tax. Substantially all of this compensation expense is recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment (SAB No. 107). SAB No. 107 addresses the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides 41 Table of Contents the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies. The company followed the interpretive guidance set forth in SAB No. 107 during its adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB Opinions No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, unless impracticable, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, and was adopted by the company in the first quarter of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effects, if any, of applying FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition and is not yet in a position to determine such effects. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies to existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement as the relevant measurement attribute. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The company has not yet determined the impact of adopting this standard. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in its balance sheet and to recognize the changes in the plans funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the change occurs. These provisions of the Statement are effective as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its fiscal year end, which is the Companys measurement date. Pursuant to the Statements adoption, the net after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $57 million. This adjustment 42 Table of Contents principally represents the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial losses and the impact of recording additional minimum liabilities for certain under funded plans. This Statement will not affect the companys ERISA funding obligations and we do not currently anticipate any required company contributions to the qualified retirement plans in the foreseeable future. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB No. 108). SAB No. 108 requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements. This dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment. The guidance in SAB No. 108 must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. There were no other new accounting standards issued in 2006 that had or are expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Forward looking Statements Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such information includes, without limitation, the business outlook, assessment of market conditions, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, future plans, contingencies and contemplated transactions of the company. Such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause or contribute to actual results of company operations, or the performance or achievements of each company, or industry results, to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any such risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere herein, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied for the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances which affect the ability of MeadWestvaco to realize improvements in operating earnings expected from the companys cost reduction initiative; competitive pricing for the companys products; changes in raw materials pricing; energy and other costs; fluctuations in demand and changes in production capacities; changes to economic growth in the United States and international economies; government policies and regulations, including, but not limited to those affecting the environment and the tobacco industry; the companys continued ability to reach agreement with its unionized employees on collective bargaining agreements; adverse results in current or future litigation; currency movements; and other risk factors discussed in the companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and in other filings made from time to time with the SEC. MeadWestvaco undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures made on related subjects in the companys reports filed with the SEC. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Interest rates It is managements objective to manage its interest expense through a blend of fixed and floating interest rate instruments. The company primarily funds itself with long term debt, having final maturities ranging from two to 40 years at date of issue, a portion of which has variable interest rates, and with variable interest rate commercial paper. The company uses interest rate swaps in managing its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Foreign currency The company has foreign based operations, primarily in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia, which accounted for approximately 28% of its 2006 net sales. In addition, certain of the companys domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of its foreign operations, the company also makes intercompany sales and receives royalties and dividends denominated in many different currencies. All of this exposes the company to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of the companys domestic operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in the companys financial statements. The companys foreign currency management policy permits it to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold, which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations. During 2006, the company entered into foreign currency hedges to partially offset the foreign currency impact of these flows on operating income. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. The company also issues intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, exposing it to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates. Generally, management uses foreign exchange hedge contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge these exposures. When applied to the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments at December 31, 2006, a 10% adverse change in currency rates would have about a $14 million effect on the companys results. Natural gas In order to better predict and control the future cost of natural gas consumed at the companys mills and plants, the company engages in financial hedging of future gas purchase prices. Gas usage is relatively predictable month by month. The company locks in the cost of a portion of its future natural gas usage by entering into swap agreements. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. 45 Table of Contents
