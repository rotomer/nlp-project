Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations OVERVIEW For the year ended December 31, 2007, MeadWestvaco reported net income of $285 million, or $1.56 per share. Net income for the year included after tax restructuring charges of $54 million, or $0.29 per share, related to employee separation costs, asset write downs and other restructuring actions, and after tax one time costs of $15 million, or $0.08 per share, related to the companys cost initiative. Also included in net income for 2007 were after tax gains of $155 million, or $0.84 per share, from two significant large tract forestlands sales of approximately 290,000 owned acres and approximately 95,000 acres under long term timber contracts, and $14 million, or $0.08 per share, related to sales of small tract forestlands. Comparable amounts for prior periods are noted later in this discussion. The amounts related to the items noted above are reflected in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. During 2007, the company generated strong revenue growth from higher selling prices and an improved product mix in many of its businesses, as well as from the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business acquired in the third quarter of 2006 and the impact of favorable foreign exchange. These positive effects were partially offset by significant inflation in energy and raw material prices. In 2007, pre tax input costs for energy, raw materials and freight were $141 million higher than in 2006, largely offsetting improvements in price and mix of $144 million. Cash flow provided by operating activities grew to $641 million in 2007 compared to $567 million in 2006, reflecting higher earnings and improvements in working capital. MeadWestvacos business segments are (i) Packaging Resources, (ii) Consumer Solutions, (iii) Consumer & Office Products, and (iv) Specialty Chemicals. For the year ended December 31, 2007, profit from the companys business segments increased 7% to $584 million compared to $546 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. During 2007, higher selling prices, improved product mix and productivity, and the impact of favorable foreign exchange, more than offset higher input costs for energy, raw materials and freight. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detail information for each segment. In 2005, the company exited its printing and writing papers business, which is recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes our results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. All references to per share amounts are presented on an after tax basis. Years ended December 31, In millions, except per share data 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 6,906 $ 6,530 $ 6,170 Cost of sales 5,710 5,399 5,087 Selling, general and administrative expenses 882 905 756 Interest expense 219 211 208 Other income, net (305 ) (83 ) (16 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 400 98 135 Income tax provision 115 5 16 Income from continuing operations 285 93 119 Discontinued operations (91 ) Net income $ 285 $ 93 $ 28 Net income per share basic and diluted: Income from continuing operations $ 1.56 $ 0.52 $ 0.62 Discontinued operations (0.48 ) Net income $ 1.56 $ 0.52 $ 0.14 14 Table of Contents Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Sales were $6.91 billion and $6.53 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Increased sales in 2007 were the result of the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business acquired in the third quarter of 2006, higher selling prices, improved product mix and the impact of favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower volumes compared to 2006. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information for each segment. Costs of sales were $5.71 billion and $5.40 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our gross margin in 2007 was approximately the same as 2006. In 2007, pre tax input costs for energy, raw materials and freight were $141 million higher than in 2006. Restructuring charges and one time costs included in cost of sales were $58 million and $53 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Maintenance costs are included in cost of sales and were $279 million in 2007 compared to $262 million in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $882 million and $905 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 12.8% and 13.9% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Lower expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was due primarily to lower restructuring charges and one time costs partially offset by the impact of the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business acquired in the third quarter of 2006 and the impact of foreign exchange. Restructuring charges and one time costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $48 million in 2007 compared to $102 million in 2006. Pension income before settlements, curtailments and termination benefits was $54 million and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Pension income is reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and is reported in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Interest expense was $219 million and $211 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2007 was primarily the result of higher interest from increased borrowings in connection with cash surrender value insurance policies compared to 2006. Other income, net, was $305 million and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Gains on sales of large tract forestlands in West Virginia, Alabama and Georgia $ (250 ) Gains on sales of small tract forestlands (24 ) (29 ) Gain on sale of corporate real estate (18 ) Gain on sale of PIK note (21 ) Interest income (20 ) (20 ) Asset impairments 2 20 Transition services income (5 ) Foreign currency exchange gains (14 ) (2 ) Other, net 1 (8 ) $ (305 ) $ (83 ) Gains on sales of large and small tract forestlands were $274 million and $29 million related to sales of 393,000 acres and 8,000 acres in 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2006, the company recorded a $21 million gain on the sale of a PIK note received as part of the consideration for the sale of the printing and writing papers business in 2005. As part of the companys initiative to reduce its real estate footprint, the company sold corporate real estate for a gain of $18 million in 2006. In 2006, income of $5 million was recorded from services provided to NewPage Corporation pursuant to the printing and writing papers sale agreement. The companys annual effective tax rate was approximately 29% and 5% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in the rate in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to a shift in the level and mix of domestic versus foreign earnings, including pre tax domestic gains of $274 million in 2007 compared to $29 million in 2006 from sales of forestlands. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and Corporate and Other. 15 Table of Contents Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Sales $ 3,021 $ 2,953 Segment profit1 322 275 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Packaging Resources segment produces bleached paperboard, Coated Natural Kraft&reg; paperboard (CNK), kraft paperboard, linerboard and saturating kraft, and packaging for consumer products including packaging for media, beverage and dairy, produce, cosmetics, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products. This segments paperboard products are manufactured at four U.S. mills and two mills located in Brazil. Bleached paperboard is used for packaging high value consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tobacco, food service, media products and aseptic cartons. CNK paperboard is used for a range of packaging applications, the largest of which for MeadWestvaco is multi pack beverage packaging. Kraft paperboard is used for folding carton applications. Linerboard is used in the manufacture of corrugated boxes and containers. Saturating kraft is used in the manufacture of decorative laminates for kitchen countertops, furniture, flooring and wall panels, as well as pad stock for electronic components. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment were $3.02 billion in 2007 compared to $2.95 billion in 2006. Increased sales were the result of higher selling prices, the impact of favorable foreign exchange and strengthened demand in key products. In 2007, product mix improvement also favorably impacted sales compared to 2006. Shipments of bleached paperboard in 2007 were 1,579,000 tons, down 4% from 2006 reflecting, in part, a shift by the company away from lower value grades. Shipments of CNK in 2007 were 1,096,000 tons, down 3% from 2006, with declines in beverage sales partially offset by higher sales of general packaging grades. Shipments of unbleached paperboard in 2007 were 839,000 tons, up 1% from 2006, as a result of higher shipments of general packaging grades. In 2007, bleached paperboard prices were up 4%, CNK prices were up 6% and unbleached paperboard prices were up 6% compared to 2006. Sales for the companys Brazilian packaging operation, Rigesa Ltda., increased 20% in 2007 over 2006 driven by improved volume and the impact of favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower selling prices. Profit for the Packaging Resources segment increased 17% to $322 million in 2007 compared to $275 million in 2006, reflecting improvements in pricing, mix and productivity, partially offset by higher input costs for raw materials and energy and lower volume. Earnings in 2007 benefited by $88 million from price increases and mix improvements, $35 million from improved productivity and $9 million from the impact of favorable foreign exchange compared to 2006. Earnings in 2007 were negatively impacted by $77 million from higher input costs, $6 million from volume declines and $2 million from higher other costs compared to 2006. Consumer Solutions Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Sales $ 2,431 $ 2,170 Segment profit1 86 93 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes.

Paperboard and plastic are converted into packaging products at plants located in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. In addition, this segment manufactures equipment that is leased or sold to its beverage, dairy and other customers to package their products. Sales for the Consumer Solutions segment increased 12% to $2.43 billion in 2007 compared to $2.17 billion in 2006. In 2007, sales improved in our beverage and healthcare business and benefited from the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business acquired in the third quarter of 2006 and the impact of favorable foreign exchange. These positive effects were partially offset by decreased sales in the media business due to market related declines. 16 Table of Contents Profit for the Consumer Solutions segment decreased 8% to $86 million in 2007 compared to $93 million in 2006. In 2007, earnings were negatively impacted by $26 million from higher input costs, $23 million from volume declines and $8 million from unfavorable pricing compared to 2006. In 2007, earnings benefited by $27 million from the impact of favorable foreign exchange and the earnings benefits from the dispensing and spraying systems business acquired in the third quarter of 2006, $20 million from improved productivity and $3 million from lower other costs compared to 2006. Consumer & Office Products Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Sales $ 1,147 $ 1,143 Segment profit1 139 127 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Consumer & Office Products segment manufactures, sources, markets and distributes school and office products, time management products and envelopes in North America and Brazil through both retail and commercial channels. MeadWestvaco produces many of the leading brand names in school supplies, time management and commercial office products, including AMCAL &reg;, AT A GLANCE &reg;, Cambridge &reg;, COLUMBIAN &reg;, Day Runner &reg;, Five Star &reg;, Mead &reg; and Trapper Keeper &reg;. Sales for the Consumer & Office Products segment increased slightly to $1.15 billion in 2007 compared to $1.14 billion in 2006. In 2007, solid performance in the segments value added branded consumer product lines, improved overall mix, the impact of favorable foreign exchange and solid performance in the Brazilian school products business were partially offset by lower volumes compared to 2006. Profit for the Consumer & Office Products segment increased 9% to $139 million in 2007 compared to $127 million in 2006. In 2007, earnings were positively impacted by $43 million from price increases and mix improvements, $5 million from improved productivity and $4 million from other items, partially offset by higher input costs of $22 million and volume declines of $18 million compared to 2006. The effect of improved mix associated with the segments continued emphasis on proprietary, branded products was partially offset by lower basic product volume during 2007. This segments operating profit continues to be impacted by low priced Asian imports. Specialty Chemicals Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Sales $ 493 $ 493 Segment profit1 37 51 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. The Specialty Chemicals segment manufacturers, markets and distributes specialty chemicals derived from sawdust and byproducts of the papermaking process in North America and Asia. Products include activated carbon used in emission control systems for automobiles and trucks, and chemicals used in printing inks, asphalt paving, adhesives and lubricants. Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment were $493 million in 2007, unchanged from 2006. In 2007, higher selling prices in most markets were offset by year over year volume declines for carbon based products due to lower automobile production volumes in North America compared to 2006, and year over year volume declines for printing ink resins due to weakness in the publication inks industry. Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment was $37 million in 2007 compared to $51 million in 2006. In 2007, decreased earnings reflect $25 million of higher input costs, volume declines of $11 million and other items of $11 million, partially offset by the positive effects of pricing and mix improvements of $33 million compared to 2006. 17 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Sales $ 217 $ 219 Corporate and Other loss1 (184 ) (448 ) 1 Corporate and Other loss may include goodwill impairment charges, minority interest, debt retirement charges, restructuring charges and one time costs, net pension income, interest income and expense, and gains on asset sales.

The results also include income and expense items not directly associated with segment operations, such as certain legal charges and settlements, restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, and other charges. Corporate and Other loss was $184 million in 2007 compared to a loss of $448 million in 2006. The decrease in the loss reflects gains of $250 million in 2007 from sales of large tract forestlands related to approximately 290,000 owned acres and approximately 95,000 acres under long term timber contracts. In 2007 compared to 2006, lower restructuring charges and one time costs of $65 million were partially offset by certain items in the 2006 results including a $21 million gain from the sale of a PIK note, an $18 million gain from the sale of corporate real estate and $5 million in transition services income from New Page Corporation. In 2007, gains from sales of small tract forestlands were lower by $5 million and other costs were higher by $2 million compared to 2006. 18 Table of Contents Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Sales were $6.53 billion and $6.17 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Increased sales in 2006 were the result of higher selling prices and improved product mix in many of our businesses, partially offset by weaker demand for certain products compared to 2005. The 2006 results include $206 million from the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business, which was acquired in July 2006. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information for each segment. Cost of sales was $5.40 billion and $5.09 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our gross margin in 2006 was approximately the same as 2005. In 2006, pre tax input costs for energy, raw materials and freight were $159 million higher than in 2005. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $53 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Maintenance costs and the effects of market related downtime are reflected in cost of sales. Total maintenance costs in 2006 were $262 million compared to $244 million in 2005. In 2006, the company took no significant market related downtime, while in 2005 the company took 109,000 tons of market related downtime which had a negative impact on results of $31 million. In 2005, the mix of market related downtime varied by business, but primarily occurred in the Packaging Resources segment. The effects of market related downtime consist of the unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production, but do not include lost profits due to lower shipment levels. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $905 million and $756 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 13.9% and 12.3% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Higher expense in 2006 was due primarily to increased restructuring charges and one time costs, the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business in July 2006 and higher share based compensation compared to 2005. Restructuring charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $60 million in 2006 and $11 million in 2005. Incremental costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 included certain one time costs, the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business and share based compensation in the amounts of $42 million and $26 million, respectively.

Interest expense from continuing operations was $211 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of incremental short term borrowings obtained in connection with the dispensing and spraying systems business acquisition. For 2005, interest expense associated with the companys papers business, which was sold in the second quarter of 2005, was included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations in the amount of $20 million. Other income, net was $83 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Gains on sales of small tract forestlands $ (29 ) $ (60 ) Gain on sale of corporate real estate (18 ) Gain on sale of PIK note (21 ) Interest income (20 ) (33 ) Asset impairments 20 Transition services income (5 ) (25 ) Loss on the extinguishment of debt 90 Foreign currency exchange losses (gains) (2 ) 8 Other, net (8 ) 4 $ (83 ) $ (16 ) Gains on sales of small tract forestlands were $29 million and $60 million related to sales of 8,000 acres and 20,000 acres in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The decline in the rate in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to a shift in the level and mix of domestic versus foreign earnings. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other. Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Sales $ 2,953 $ 2,836 Segment profit1 275 234 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment increased to $3.0 billion in 2006 compared to $2.8 billion in 2005. The sales increase of 4% for 2006 over 2005 was the result of higher selling prices and strengthened demand in key products. Product mix improvement also favorably impacted sales in 2006.

Sales for the companys Brazilian packaging operation, Rigesa Ltda., increased 8% in 2006 over 2005 driven by improved mix and improved volume, partially offset by lower selling prices. Profit for the Packaging Resources segment increased to $275 million in 2006 compared to $234 million in 2005. The 18% improvement reflects improvements in pricing, volume and mix and productivity, partially offset by higher input costs for raw materials and energy. Earnings in 2006 benefited by $54 million from price increases and mix improvements, $5 million from volume improvement and $70 million from improved productivity. Earnings in 2006 were negatively affected by $77 million from higher input costs and $11 million in other operating cost increases compared to the prior year. The 2005 results reflect the impact of higher market related downtime and the impact of two hurricanes. Consumer Solutions Years ended December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Sales $ 2,170 $ 2,021 Segment profit1 93 102 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes.

Excluding the impact of this acquisition, sales in 2006 declined 3% as compared to 2005. Sales improved slightly for our beverage business, but declined for other specialty packaging lines. Sales were particularly weak for media as demand for music packaging declined, game volumes decreased due to delayed next generation console releases and the absence of DVD packaging business for the years blockbuster filmed entertainment titles. Profit for the Consumer Solutions segment decreased 9% to $93 million in 2006 compared to $102 million in 2005. In 2006, earnings benefits from the acquisition of the dispensing and spraying systems business in July 2006, improved results in our beverage, personal care and tobacco businesses and certain cost improvements of $28 million were offset by $6 million in higher input costs, $7 million in volume decreases, $5 million in unfavorable price and mix and $19 million in higher other material and operating costs compared to 2005. 20 Table of Contents Consumer & Office Products Years ended December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Sales $ 1,143 $ 1,125 Segment profit1 127 130 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Sales for the Consumer & Office Products segment increased slightly to $1.14 billion in 2006 compared to $1.13 billion in 2005. The 2% sales growth reflects solid performance in the segments value added branded consumer product lines, improved overall mix and a solid performance in the Brazilian school products business, partially offset by customers shortening their supply chain which caused sales delays in certain products into the first quarter of 2007. Profit for the Consumer & Office Products segment was $127 million in 2006 compared to $130 million in 2005. Results in 2006 were positively impacted by $45 million from price increases and mix improvements, offset by the negative impact of higher input and operating costs of $35 million and volume declines of $13 million compared to 2005.

Specialty Chemicals Years ended December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Sales $ 493 $ 425 Segment profit1 51 39 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest income and expense, income taxes, minority interest, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment increased to a record $493 million in 2006 from $425 million in 2005 due to higher selling prices and strong demand for the segments industrial pine chemicals used in asphalt paving, dyes and proprietary publication ink resins and other industrial markets. Year over year volumes for carbon based products were essentially flat due to lower automobile production volumes in North America. Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment was $51 million in 2006 compared to $39 million in 2005. In 2006, increased earnings reflect the positive effects of pricing and volume of $50 million and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses of $4 million, partially offset by higher input costs of $42 million compared to 2005.

Corporate and Other loss was $448 million in 2006 compared to a loss of $370 million in 2005. The higher loss in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of higher restructuring charges of $104 million, lower gains on small tract forestlands sales of $31 million, lower transition services income from NewPage Corporation of $20 million, lower pension income of $17 million, one time costs in 2006 of $42 million, offset by debt retirement charges of $90 million in 2005, a gain from the sale of the PIK note of $21 million in 2006, a gain on the sale of corporate real estate of $18 million in 2006, and lower other costs of $7 million in 2006 compared to 2005. 21 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Overview Given the uncertainty in the economy in 2008, MeadWestvaco will focus on those actions within its control to drive year over year revenue and earnings growth.

The segment also expects contributions to its growth from new products, including Natralock&reg;, the segments paperboard based plastic clamshell replacement solution, Shellpak, the segments adherence solution for prescription medications and the segments patented foamer and airless dispensing systems. These top line drivers combined with ongoing productivity actions, including manufacturing and supply chain enhancements, improved sourcing and organizational streamlining, are expected to more than offset input cost inflation and market related declines in the segments media business. Consumer & Office Products The Consumer & Office Products segment is expecting performance in 2008 to be consistent with that of 2007. The segment generates most of its sales and profits in the second half of the year due to the strong seasonal nature of its market leading school and time management products. Although the impact of a slowing North American economy on the segments business is hard to predict at this time, the segment is focused on generating modest year over year profit growth by increasing sell through of its higher value proprietary branded products. The benefits of improved price and mix from this ongoing initiative in conjunction with continued productivity will be partially offset by continued high costs for uncoated paper, the segments principal raw material. Specialty Chemicals In 2008, global demand for MeadWestvacos pine chemicals, including proprietary chemicals used in the production of printing inks, asphalt, adhesives and lubricants is expected to remain solid. Price increases, geographic expansion and improved productivity are expected to more than offset higher costs for raw materials, mainly crude tall oil, the principal input used in the manufacture of pine chemicals, and modest volume declines in the segments carbon technology business as a result of lower North American auto sales. Community Development and Land Management Group In 2007, MeadWestvaco established a new division to maximize the value of its remaining 817,000 acres of owned forestlands in the U.S. through a new and sustainable business. The Community Development and Land Management Group is segmenting the companys forestlands holdings according to highest best use (HBU) and entitle, enhance and or sub divide them to achieve maximum value. In 2008, management expects increased sales of small tracts at prices generally above traditional forestland. The exact amount and timing, however, are unpredictable due to market dynamics in areas where the business operates and to the prolonged sales cycle that is associated with the real estate asset class. 22 Table of Contents Cost initiative As part of the cost initiative launched in 2005 to improve the efficiency of our business model, we are continuing to focus on reducing the cost structure across the company by moving to a more simplified, standardized global model. We are also reducing our real estate footprint and streamlining our warehousing and logistics network. The goal of this initiative was to reduce the overall cost structure of the company by $175 million to $200 million, before inflation, on an annual run rate basis by the end of 2007. Specific actions were completed in 2007 which resulted in annual run rate savings of $65 million, bringing cumulative run rate savings through December 31, 2007 to $190 million, before inflation. We expect to drive productivity programs to achieve 3% year over year improvement. Other items Capital spending was $347 million in 2007 and is expected to be $330 million to $340 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $520 million in 2007 and is expected to be about $500 million in 2008. Interest expense was $219 million in 2007 and is expected to be $215 million to $225 million in 2008. Management currently estimates overall pension income in 2008 to be about $80 million which will be derived primarily from the companys domestic plans. This estimate assumes a discount rate of 6.25%, a salary increase rate of 4.0% and an expected rate of return on assets of 8.5%. Recent developments in global credit markets, primarily related to the problems in the subprime mortgage market, have not had a material impact on the companys investments, credit facilities or pension surplus. In addition, these developments have not had a material impact on the companys relationships with its current vendors and customers. Management will continue to monitor potential changes in the subprime market and related markets which may have an impact on its businesses.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $245 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $156 million at December 31, 2006. In 2008, the company expects cash flow from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures, dividends to shareholders and scheduled debt payments. In addition, the company has available a $750 million committed revolving credit facility under an agreement that expires in December 2010. The credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2007. Operating activities Cash provided by continuing operations was $641 million in 2007, compared to $567 million in 2006 and $305 million in 2005. The increase in operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to increased earnings and improvements in working capital. Net income from continuing operations was $285 million, $93 million and $119 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note Q of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for discussion related to changes in working capital. Included in 2005 cash flow from working capital changes were tax payments of $160 million related to the sale of the printing and writing papers business. There was no cash flow from discontinued operations in 2007 and 2006, compared to cash used by discontinued operations of $78 million in 2005. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $236 million in 2007, compared to cash used in investing activities of $761 million in 2006 and cash provided by investing activities of $1,985 million in 2005. Asset sales, including sales of forestlands, generated $191 million of proceeds in 2007, compared to $165 million in 2006 and $109 million in 2005. Capital spending totaled $347 million in 2007, compared to $302 million in 2006 and $305 million in 2005. Proceeds of the sale of a debt security generated $109 million of proceeds in 2006. The primary source of funds in 2005 was proceeds of $2.2 billion from the sale of the printing and writing papers business. During 2007, we acquired two manufacturers of high quality, innovative dispensing and sprayer systems to strengthen our primary packaging offerings for a total purchase price of $52 million. During 2006, we acquired Calmar, a leading global manufacturer of high quality and innovative dispensing and spraying systems, with manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia for a total purchase price of $714 million. During 2005, we acquired DZN, The Design Group, a full service design and marketing company to enhance MeadWestvacos package design capabilities for a total purchase price of $5 million. See related discussion in Note P of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities was $339 million in 2007, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $35 million in 2006 and cash used in financing activities of $2,181 million in 2005. In 2007, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with a financial institution counterparty to purchase $400 million of the companys common stock. This program was funded by proceeds from sales of forestlands that closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. Under this program, as of December 31, 2007 the company received and retired 11.1 million shares and may receive additional shares up to 3 million under the provisions of agreement, which will be no later than June 2008. Under a separate share repurchase program, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares for $86 million in 2007. In 2007, the company received $338 million in proceeds under a secured financing agreement with a bank collateralized by a $398 million installment note received as consideration from the sale of forestlands (the Timber Note). Under the terms of the agreement, the liability from this transaction is non recourse to MeadWestvaco and shall be paid from the Timber Note proceeds upon its maturity. The non recourse liability does not require any principal payments until its maturity in October 2027 and bears interest at a rate approximating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). For further discussion related to this transaction, see Note D of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. The companys Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.92 per share, paying a total of $169 million, $167 million and $178 million of dividends to shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercises of stock options were $162 million, $53 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, the company repurchased and retired 1.3 million shares related to an obligation under a share put option to the former owner of a subsidiary. The cash impact of this transaction was approximately $47 million. The 1.3 million shares repurchased under the put option were not a reduction of the share repurchases authorized by the Board of Directors in 2005. 24 Table of Contents In 2005, proceeds received from the sale of the companys printing and writing papers business were used to retire approximately $1 billion in debt and to repurchase approximately 24 million shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of $700 million. All of the repurchased shares of common stock were retired. In October 2005, the companys Board of Directors authorized the future repurchase of an additional five million shares primarily to avoid dilution of earnings per share related to employee equity awards. At December 31, 2007, the company had a $750 million bank credit facility that expires in December 2010. Borrowings under this agreement can be in unsecured domestic or eurodollar notes and at rates approximating prime or LIBOR at the companys option. The $750 million credit agreement contains a financial covenant limiting the percentage of total debt (including a $338 million liability non recourse to MeadWestvaco) to total capitalization (including deferred taxes) to 55% as well as certain other covenants of which the company is in compliance. The revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had $68 million and $211 million of notes payable and current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations, respectively. The maximum amounts of combined commercial paper outstanding during 2007 and 2006 were $279 million and $355 million, respectively. The average amounts of commercial paper outstanding during 2007 and 2006 were $118 million and $136 million, with an average interest rate of 5.4% and 5.5%, respectively. During 2007, the company obtained access to certain uncommitted credit lines. Short term borrowings under these agreements were $45 million at December 31, 2007, with interest rates ranging from 5.3% to 7.3%. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 23% and 22% of the companys long term debt was variable rate, after factoring in the companys interest rate swaps. The weighted average interest rate on the companys fixed rate long term debt was approximately 8.7% and approximately 8.8% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the companys variable rate long term debt was approximately 5.3% for both 2007 and 2006. The percentage of debt to total capital was 39.7% and 42.2% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. EFFECTS OF INFLATION Prices for energy, including natural gas, oil and electricity, and input costs for certain raw materials and freight, increased significantly in 2007 and 2006. The increase in these costs affected many of the companys businesses. During 2007, the pre tax input cost of energy, raw materials and freight was $141 million higher than in 2006. During 2006, the pre tax input cost of energy, raw materials and freight was $159 million higher than in 2005. ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over foreign operations of the company. Due to changes in environmental laws and regulations, the application of such regulations, including those relating to global climate change, and changes in environmental control technology, it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes. Taking these uncertainties into account, we estimate that we will incur approximately $26 million in environmental capital expenditures in 2008 and approximately $28 million in 2009. Approximately $19 million was spent on environmental capital projects in 2007. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) or by various state or local governments that we may be liable under federal environmental laws or under applicable state or local laws with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances at sites previously operated or used by the company. The company is currently named as a potentially responsible party (PRP), or has received third party requests for contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state or local laws with respect to numerous sites. There are other sites which may contain contamination or which may be potential Superfund sites, but for which MeadWestvaco has not received any notice or claim. The potential liability for all these sites will depend upon several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, insurance coverage and contribution by other PRPs. The company regularly evaluates its potential liability at these various sites. At December 31, 2007, MeadWestvaco had recorded liabilities of approximately $21 million for estimated potential cleanup costs based upon its close monitoring of ongoing activities and its past experience with these matters. The company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with these sites may exceed amounts of recorded liabilities by an amount that could range from an insignificant amount to as much as $20 million. This estimate is less certain than the estimate upon which the environmental liabilities were based. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. As with numerous other large industrial companies, the company has been named a defendant in asbestos related personal injury litigation. Typically, these suits also name many other corporate defendants. All of the claims against the company resolved to date have been concluded before trial, either through dismissal or through settlement with payments to the plaintiff that are not material to the company. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, have not been significant. As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately 350 lawsuits. Management believes that the company has substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. The company has valid defenses to these claims and intends to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on its historical experience 25 Table of Contents in asbestos cases and an analysis of the current cases, the company believes that it has adequate amounts accrued for potential settlements and judgments in asbestos related litigation. At December 31, 2007, the company had recorded litigation liabilities of approximately $19 million, a significant portion of which relates to asbestos. Should the volume of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that the company could incur significant costs resolving these cases. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. The company is involved in various other litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the currently expected outcome of any matter, lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The company enters into various contractual obligations throughout the year. Presented below are the contractual obligations of the company as of December 31, 2007, and the time period in which payments under the obligations are due. Disclosures related to long term debt, capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations are included in the Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.

The transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of $83 million, or $0.28 per share, and is included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. On October 9, 2007, the company completed the sale of approximately 228,000 acres of owned forestlands and approximately 95,000 acres under long term timber contracts in Alabama and Georgia for $400 million principally in the form of a long term installment note supported by an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank obtained by the buyer of the forestlands. The transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of $167 million, or $0.56 per share, and is included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The definitive agreement includes a long term fiber supply agreement under which fiber will be sold to the company at market prices. See Note B of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of these transactions. Accelerated share repurchase program On November 20, 2007, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution counterparty (the Counterparty) to purchase $400 million of MeadWestvacos common stock. This program was funded by proceeds from sales of forestlands that closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. The agreement is a collared transaction in which the company agreed to purchase for $400 million a number of its shares to be determined based on the volume weighted average price of its common stock during a specified period of time, subject to certain provisions that establish minimum and maximum numbers of shares that may be purchased. The hedge period for determining the minimum and maximum numbers of shares to be purchased ended on December 14, 2007, resulting in a minimum number of shares of 11.1 million and a maximum number of shares of 14 million. On November 21, 2007 and December 14, 2007, the Counterparty delivered 10 million shares and 1.1 million shares, respectively. Accordingly, the company received 11.1 million shares through December 31, 2007, equivalent to the minimum number of shares to be delivered. At the conclusion of the program, which will be no later than June 2008, the company may receive additional shares up to the maximum number of 14 million for no additional payment. In certain extraordinary events that result in a substantial increase in the companys stock price during a specified period of time up to a period of six months from the inception of the agreement, the company may be required to return some of the shares it received to the Counterparty. The purchased shares through December 31, 2007 were retired and recorded as a $400 million reduction to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet pursuant to regulations of the State of Delaware, the state of incorporation of MeadWestvaco, and the approval by the companys Board of Directors. Restructuring charges Year ended December 31, 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2007, the company recorded pre tax charges of $85 million for employee separation costs, asset write downs and other restructuring actions of which $57 million, $24 million and $4 million were recorded within cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other income, net, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, actions related to employee separation costs were substantially paid. In addition, the company sold previously written down Consumer & Office Products assets, resulting in a gain of $2 million. 28 Table of Contents Acquisitions and dispositions 2007 acquisitions During the third quarter of 2007, the company acquired two manufacturers of high quality, innovative dispensing and sprayer systems to strengthen the companys primary packaging business. These acquisitions provide the company with new technologies and increased access to customers in growing and important end markets. The technologies from these acquisitions will be integrated with the companys North American, European and Asian production facilities to extend the companys growth in critical markets such as personal care and home and garden. The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions including direct transaction costs was $52 million. 2006 acquisitions During the third quarter of 2006, the company acquired Saint Gobain Calmar (Calmar) from Compagnie de Saint Gobain. Calmar is a leading global manufacturer of high quality and innovative dispensing and spraying systems, with manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. The acquisition of Calmar provides the company with increased access to growing and important end markets, geographies and strategic customers, valuable product pipeline and commercial synergies. These synergies include the combined entities ability to provide broader product and packaging solutions offerings. Excluding cash acquired, the purchase price including direct transaction costs was $714 million. Discontinued operations In connection with the sale of the companys printing and papers writing business that occurred in 2005, the company recorded an after tax loss from discontinued operations of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Results for 2005 were negatively impacted by sales related costs, including lease termination charges; asset impairments; debt extinguishment costs; pension settlement and curtailment losses; and other related costs included in discontinued operations. 29 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our principal accounting policies are described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes the accounting policies discussed below represent those accounting policies requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to reported results. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the companys disclosure. Environmental and legal liabilities: We record accruals for estimated environmental liabilities when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to the probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as availability of insurance coverage and contribution by other potentially responsible parties. Due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments, and changes in governmental regulations and environmental technologies, accruals are subject to substantial uncertainties, and actual costs could be materially greater or less than the estimated amounts. We record accruals for other legal contingencies, which are also subject to numerous uncertainties and variables associated with assumptions and judgments, when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Liabilities recorded for claims are limited to pending cases based on the companys historical experience, consultation with outside counsel and consultation with an actuarial specialist concerning the feasibility of reasonably estimating liabilities associated with claims that may arise in the future. We recognize insurance recoveries when collection is reasonably assured. Restructuring and other charges: We periodically record charges for the reduction of our workforce, the closure of manufacturing facilities and other actions related to business improvement and productivity initiatives. These events require estimates of liabilities for employee separation payments and related benefits, demolition, facility closures and other costs, which could differ from actual costs incurred. Pension and postretirement benefits: In August 2006, the President signed into law the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). The PPA establishes new minimum funding rules for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. The company does not anticipate any required funding to the U.S. qualified retirement plans in the foreseeable future as a result of this legislation and due to the overfunded status of the plans. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in its balance sheet and to recognize the changes in the plans funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the change occurs. These provisions of the Statement are effective as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its fiscal year end, which is consistent with the companys measurement date. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 was an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the amount of $57 million, net of tax, which principally represents the impact of recognizing previously unrecognized prior service cost and net actuarial losses. Assumptions used in the determination of net pension cost and postretirement benefit expense, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and increases in future compensation and medical costs, are evaluated by the company, reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate. Actual asset returns and compensation and medical costs, which are more favorable than assumptions, can have the effect of lowering expense and cash contributions, and, conversely, actual results, which are less favorable than assumptions, could increase expense and cash contributions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense in such future periods. In 2007, the company recorded pre tax pension income before settlements, curtailments and termination benefits of $54 million, compared to $50 million in 2006 and $67 million in 2005. The company currently estimates overall pre tax pension income in 2008 will increase by approximately $25 million, reflecting normal growth in service and interest cost off set by asset returns, as well as actuarial gains related to favorable demographic assumption variances. The estimate assumes a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.50%, and a discount rate of 6.25%. The company determined the discount rate by referencing the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The company believes that using a yield curve approach more accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled. Previously, the company referenced indices for long term, high quality bonds, ensuring that the durations of those indices were not materially different from the durations of the plans liabilities, or if different, that adjusting the discount rate would not have produced results that were materially different from using a common discount rate for all of its plans. 30 Table of Contents If the expected rate of return on plan assets were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income in 2008 would change by approximately $16 million. Similarly, if the discount rate were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income would change by approximately $0.5 million. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate value of pension fund assets had increased to $3.5 billion from $3.4 billion at December 31, 2006, reflecting overall equity and fixed income market performance. Prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses in the retirement and postretirement benefit plans subject to amortization are amortized over the average remaining service periods, which are about 10 years and 5 years, respectively, and are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2004, the company modified certain postretirement healthcare benefits to be provided to future retirees. This change reduced the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $68 million, and is being amortized over the remaining life of the eligible employees, which is approximately 24 years. Long lived assets useful lives: Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based on managements estimates of the periods over which the assets will be productively utilized in the revenue generation process or for other useful purposes. Factors that affect the determination of lives include prior experience with similar assets, product life expectations and industry practices. The determination of useful lives dictates the period over which tangible and intangible long lived assets are depreciated or amortized, typically using the straight line method. Tangible assets: We review long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. The statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review for impairment involves management to predict the estimated cash flows that will be generated by the long lived asset over its remaining estimated useful life. Considerable judgment must be exercised as to determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to use in any value computations. Intangible assets: Business acquisitions often result in recording intangible assets. Intangible assets are recognized at the time of an acquisition, based upon their fair value. Similar to long lived tangible assets, intangible assets are subject to periodic impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As with tangible assets, considerable judgment must be exercised. Goodwill: Goodwill arises in business combinations when the purchase price of assets acquired exceeds the appraised value. As with tangible and other intangible assets, periodic impairment reviews are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. As with its review of impairment of tangible and intangible assets, management uses judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment. We will review the recorded value of our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. The review for impairment requires management to predict the estimated cash flows that will be generated by the long lived asset over its remaining estimated useful life. Considerable judgment must be exercised in determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to be used in any value computations. Revenue recognition: We recognize revenue at the point when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through product sales, and shipping terms generally indicate when title and the risk of ownership have passed. Revenue is recognized at shipment for sales when shipping terms are FOB (free on board) shipping point unless risk of loss is maintained under freight terms. For sales where shipping terms are FOB destination, revenue is recognized when the goods are received by the customer. We provide for all allowances for estimated returns and other customer credits such as discounts and volume rebates, when the revenue is recognized, based on historical experience, current trends and any notification of pending returns. The customer allowances are, in many instances, subjective and are determined with significant management judgment and are reviewed regularly to determine the adequacy of the amounts. Changes in economic conditions, markets and customer relationships may require adjustments to these allowances from period to period. Also included in net sales is service revenue which is recognized as the service is performed. Revenue is recognized for leased equipment to customers on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the lease and is included in net sales of the company. Income taxes: Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws. We evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment, including the forecast of future taxable income and the valuation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made. 31 Table of Contents The company has tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. In the preparation of the companys financial statements, management exercises judgments in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and applies the guidance pursuant to FIN 48 which employs a more likely than not criteria approach for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. While actual results could vary, in managements judgment, the company has adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters. Each quarter, management must estimate our effective tax rate for the full year. This estimate includes assumptions about the level of income that will be achieved for the full year in both our domestic and international operations. The forecast of full year earnings includes assumptions about markets in each of our businesses as well as the timing of certain transactions, including forestland sales gains and restructuring charges. Should business performance or the timing of certain transactions change during the year, the level of income achieved may not meet the level of income estimated earlier in the year at interim periods. This change in the income levels and mix of earnings can result in significant adjustments to the tax provision in the quarter in which the estimate is refined. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment. SAB No. 107 addresses the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies. The company followed the interpretive guidance set forth in SAB No. 107 during its adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces Accounting Principals Board (APB) Opinions No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, unless impracticable, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, and was adopted by the company in the first quarter of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. See Note N of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for discussion of the effects of this accounting change. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies to existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement as the relevant measurement attribute. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which it is initially applied. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in its balance sheet and to recognize the changes in the plans funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the change occurs. These provisions of the Statement are effective as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its fiscal year end, which is the Companys measurement date. Pursuant to the Statements adoption, the net after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $57 million. This adjustment principally represents the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial losses and the impact of recording additional minimum liabilities for certain under funded plans. This Statement will not affect the companys funding obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and we do not currently anticipate any required company contributions to the U.S. qualified retirement plans in the foreseeable future. 32 Table of Contents In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements. This dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment. The guidance in SAB No. 108 must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have an effect on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This Statement permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, which would result in the reporting of unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis, with few exceptions, as long as it is applied to the instrument in its entirety. The Statement establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of an entitys election on its earnings, but does not eliminate the disclosure requirements of other accounting standards. This Statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which it is initially applied. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of this Statement. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). This Statement replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including those arising from contractual contingencies, any contingent consideration, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the statement. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values (or other amounts determined in accordance with SFAS No. 141(R)). In addition, SFAS No. 141(R)s requirement to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value will result in recognizing the goodwill attributable to the noncontrolling interest in addition to that attributable to the acquirer. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest, and requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statements of operations of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal periods, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 could have on its consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards issued in 2007 that had or are expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Forward looking Statements Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such information includes, without limitation, the business outlook, assessment of market conditions, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, future plans, contingencies and contemplated transactions of the company. Such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause or contribute to actual results of company operations, or the performance of achievements of each company, or industry results, to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any such risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere herein, risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied for the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances which affect the ability of MeadWestvaco to realize improvements in operating earnings from the companys ongoing cost reduction initiatives; the reorganization of the companys packaging business units; competitive pricing for the companys products; changes in raw materials pricing; energy and other costs; fluctuations in demand and changes in production capacities; changes to economic growth in the United States and international economies; government policies and regulations, including, but not limited to those affecting the environment and the tobacco industry; the companys continued ability to reach agreement with its unionized employees on collective bargaining agreements; the companys ability to execute its plans to divest or otherwise realize the greater value associated with its forestlands; adverse results in current or future litigation; currency movements; and other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in other filings made from time to time with the SEC. MeadWestvaco undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures made on related subjects in the companys reports filed with the SEC. 34 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Interest rates It is managements objective to manage its interest expense through a blend of fixed and floating interest rate instruments. The company primarily funds itself with long term debt, having final maturities ranging from two to 40 years at date of issue, and with short term variable rate borrowings. The company uses interest rate swaps in managing its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. Foreign currency The company has foreign based operations, primarily in South America, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia, which accounted for approximately 31% of its 2007 net sales. In addition, certain of the companys domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of its foreign operations, the company also makes intercompany sales and receives royalties and dividends denominated in many different currencies. All of this exposes the company to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of the companys domestic operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in the companys financial statements. The companys foreign currency management policy permits it to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold, which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations. During 2007 and 2006, the company entered into foreign currency hedges to partially offset the foreign currency impact of these flows on operating income. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. The company also issues intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, exposing it to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates. Generally, management uses foreign exchange hedge contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge these exposures. When applied to the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments at December 31, 2007, a 10% adverse change in currency rates would have about a $27 million effect on the companys results. Natural gas In order to better predict and control the future cost of natural gas consumed at the companys mills and plants, the company engages in financial hedging of future gas purchase prices. Gas usage is relatively predictable month by month. The company hedges primarily with financial instruments that are priced based on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas futures contracts. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. 35 Table of Contents
