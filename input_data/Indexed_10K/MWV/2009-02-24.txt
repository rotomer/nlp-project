Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations OVERVIEW For the year ended December 31, 2008, MeadWestvaco Corporation (MeadWestvaco, MWV, or the company) reported net income from continuing operations of $80 million, or $0.46 per share. Net income from continuing operations includes after tax restructuring charges of $44 million, or $0.26 per share, related to employee separation costs, asset write downs and other restructuring actions. Restructuring charges are included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Comparable results for prior years are noted later in this discussion. Sales from continuing operations were $6.64 billion, up 4% from sales of $6.41 billion in 2007. During 2008, revenue growth was driven primarily from MWVs ongoing efforts to improve pricing and product mix and from the benefit of favorable foreign currency exchange. MWV continued to generate sales momentum and improved pricing in targeted global packaging markets, including growth from new products and packaging sales from emerging markets where the company has focused much of its expansion investments in recent years. Earnings in 2008 were adversely impacted by significant input cost inflation and reflect lower year over year demand in some consumer packaging markets, largely during the latter part of 2008 when the company experienced the effects of the global economic contraction. In 2008, pre tax costs for energy, raw materials and freight were $254 million higher compared to 2007, offsetting improvements in pricing and product mix of $165 million on a continuing operations basis. In 2008, cash flow from continuing operations of $364 million was a significant source of funds for the company, driven by our continued focus of prioritizing cash generation as a key operating principle across our businesses. On July 1, 2008, the company completed the sale of its North Charleston, South Carolina kraft paper mill and related assets (collectively, the Kraft business) for net cash proceeds of $466 million, which resulted in an after tax gain of $8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the after tax gain as well as the after tax operating results of the Kraft business are reported as income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. Prior period amounts have been recast on a comparable basis. The results of operations and assets and liabilities of the Kraft business were previously included in the Packaging Resources segment. On January 15, 2009, MWV announced that it is implementing a series of broad cost reduction actions to further reduce its corporate and business unit overhead cost structure, optimize its manufacturing footprint, and realize sourcing savings throughout its supply chain. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of about 2,000 positions, or 10% of MWVs global workforce, and the closure or restructuring of 12 to 14 manufacturing facilities by the end of 2009. These cost management actions, which build on MWVs recent commercial alignment improvements and are in addition to our ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, are designed to achieve $125 million in pre tax savings in 2009, with a targeted run rate range of $250 million to $300 million by mid 2010. In connection with these actions, we expect to incur pre tax restructuring charges of $200 million to $250 million, of which $29 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the remainder expected to be recorded during 2009. The cash portion of these charges is expected to be $50 million to $60 million in 2009. 16 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes our results for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. All references to per share amounts are presented on an after tax basis. Years ended December 31, In millions, except per share data 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 6,637 $ 6,407 $ 6,050 Cost of sales 5,573 5,262 4,964 Selling, general and administrative expenses 809 870 894 Interest expense 210 205 195 Other income, net (34 ) (301 ) (83 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 79 371 80 Income tax (benefit) provision (1 ) 105 (1 ) Income from continuing operations 80 266 81 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 10 19 12 Net income $ 90 $ 285 $ 93 Net income per share basic and diluted: Income from continuing operations $ 0.46 $ 1.45 $ 0.45 Income from discontinued operations 0.06 0.11 0.07 Net income $ 0.52 $ 1.56 $ 0.52 Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Sales were $6.64 billion and $6.41 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Increased sales in 2008 were driven by improved pricing and product mix and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by lower volumes compared to 2007, primarily due to the effects of the global economic contraction in the second half of 2008. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information. Costs of sales were $5.57 billion and $5.26 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Increased cost of sales in 2008 was driven by continued significant input cost inflation, partially offset by lower volumes compared to 2007. In 2008, pre tax input costs for energy, raw materials and freight included in cost of sales were $260 million higher compared to 2007. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $41 million and $57 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $809 million and $870 million, or 12.2% and 13.6% as a percentage of sales, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Lower expense in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to improved productivity, lower restructuring charges and one time costs, and lower employee incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In 2008, improved productivity lowered selling, general and administrative expenses by $83 million compared to 2007. Restructuring charges and one time costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $26 million and $48 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Pension income from continuing operations was $93 million and $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2008, pension income includes a pre tax curtailment gain of $11 million resulting from U.S. employee reductions associated with the companys 2005 cost initiative. Pension income is reported in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and is included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. 17 Table of Contents Interest expense was $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and was comprised of $164 million related to bond and bank debt, $13 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV and $33 million related to other borrowings. Interest expense was $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and was comprised of $178 million related to bond and bank debt and $27 million related to other borrowings. Other income, net was $34 million and $301 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Gains on sales of large tract forestlands 1 $ $ (250 ) Gains on sales of small tract forestlands 1 (24 ) Gains on sales of other assets (16 ) Interest income (39 ) (19 ) Asset impairments 2 Foreign currency exchange losses (gains) 23 (12 ) Other, net (2 ) 2 $ (34 ) $ (301 ) 1 In 2008, sales of landholdings are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the strategic view and structure of the operations of the Community Development and Land Management segment established in 2008. For periods prior to 2008, gains from sales of landholdings are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The companys annual effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was approximately (1)% and 28% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to favorable settlements of certain federal tax audit issues, benefits from changes in federal tax laws and regulations, and the mix of results between the companys domestic and foreign operations, including lower pre tax domestic gains of $234 million from sales of forestlands in 2008 compared to 2007. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of the companys business segments and Corporate and Other. MWVs business segments are (i) Packaging Resources, (ii) Consumer Solutions, (iii) Consumer & Office Products, (iv) Specialty Chemicals, and (v) Community Development and Land Management. The company is presenting the Community Development and Land Management business as a separate segment (previously included in Corporate and Other) to align segment disclosures with managements analysis of results of operations and the process to allocate resources adopted in 2008. Results for 2007 and 2006 have been recast to reflect the new segment structure. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a reconciliation of the sum of the results of the business segments and Corporate and Other to the companys consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes. Restructuring charges are included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Refer to the discussion included in Significant Transactions herein below for restructuring charges attributable to the companys business segments. 18 Table of Contents Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Sales 1 $ 2,667 $ 2,504 Segment profit 1, 2 195 281 1 Results for 2007 have been recast to exclude the discontinued operations of the Kraft business. 2 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, minority interest income and losses and discontinued operations. The Packaging Resources segment produces bleached paperboard, Coated Natural Kraft&reg; paperboard (CNK), linerboard, and packaging for consumer products including packaging for beverage and dairy, produce, cosmetics, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products and media. This segments paperboard products are manufactured at three mills located in the U.S. and two mills located in Brazil. Bleached paperboard is used for packaging high value consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, personal and beauty care, cosmetics, tobacco, food service and aseptic cartons. CNK paperboard is used for a range of packaging applications, the largest of which for MWV is multi pack beverage packaging. Linerboard is used in the manufacture of corrugated boxes and other containers. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment increased to $2.67 billion in 2008 compared to $2.50 billion in 2007. Increased sales were driven by improved pricing and product mix in key paperboard grades and by volume growth in bleached board. Shipments of bleached paperboard in 2008 were 1,646,000 tons, up 5% from 2007 reflecting, in part, a shift by the company away from lower value grades. Shipments of CNK in 2008 were 1,043,000 tons, down 5% from 2007, mainly reflecting declines in beverage and general packaging grades in late 2008 as customers de stocked inventories in response to weak economic conditions. In 2008, bleached paperboard prices were up 5% and CNK prices were up 4% compared to 2007. Sales for the companys Brazilian packaging operation, Rigesa Ltda., increased 19% in 2008 over 2007, due primarily to continued solid demand for corrugated packaging solutions in the domestic Brazilian market. Profit for the Packaging Resources segment decreased to $195 million in 2008 compared to $281 million in 2007, reflecting record input cost inflation offsetting improvements in pricing and product mix and higher volume. Earnings in 2008 were negatively impacted by $162 million from higher input costs for energy, raw materials and freight and $51 million from unfavorable productivity due primarily to unscheduled maintenance and hurricane related downtime. Earnings in 2008 benefited by $98 million from improved pricing and product mix, $12 million from the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange, $8 million from higher volume and $9 million from other favorable items compared to 2007. 19 Table of Contents Consumer Solutions Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Sales $ 2,511 $ 2,431 Segment profit 1 56 86 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, minority interest income and losses and discontinued operations. The Consumer Solutions segment offers a full range of converting and consumer packaging solutions including printed plastic packaging and injection molded products used for personal and beauty care, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products; dispensing and sprayer systems for personal and beauty care, healthcare, fragrance and home and garden markets; and packaging for media products such as DVDs, CDs, video games and software. This segment designs and produces multi pack cartons and packaging systems primarily for the beverage take home market and packaging for the tobacco market. Paperboard and plastic are converted into packaging products at plants located in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. This segment also has pharmaceutical packaging contracts with retailers, including well known mass merchants. In addition, this segment manufactures equipment that is leased or sold to its beverage and dairy customers to package their products. Sales for the Consumer Solutions segment increased to $2.51 billion in 2008 compared to $2.43 billion in 2007. In 2008, higher sales were driven by growth in global beverage, home and garden and healthcare markets, and from the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2007. These positive effects were partially offset by year over year volume declines in media and personal care packaging due to weakening economic conditions in the second half of 2008. Profit for the Consumer Solutions segment decreased to $56 million in 2008 compared to $86 million in 2007. In 2008, earnings were negatively impacted by $40 million from higher input costs of energy, raw materials and freight and $9 million from other unfavorable items compared to 2007. In 2008, earnings benefited by $11 million from improved productivity, $5 million from improved pricing and product mix and $3 million from higher volume compared to 2007. 20 Table of Contents Consumer & Office Products Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Sales $ 1,063 $ 1,147 Segment profit 1 96 139 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, minority interest income and losses and discontinued operations. The Consumer & Office Products segment manufactures, sources, markets and distributes school and office products, time management products and envelopes in North America and Brazil through both retail and commercial channels. MeadWestvaco produces many of the leading brand names in school supplies, time management and commercial office products, including AMCAL, &reg; AT A GLANCE, &reg; Cambridge, &reg; COLUMBIAN, &reg; Day Runner, &reg; Five Star, &reg; Mead &reg; and Trapper Keeper. &reg; Sales for the Consumer & Office Products segment decreased to $1.06 billion in 2008 compared to $1.15 billion in 2007. In 2008, volume declines across key product lines due to the weakening U.S. economy offset improvements in pricing and product mix compared to 2007, as well as higher year over year sales in the Brazilian school products business. This segment continues to be impacted by Asian based imported products. Profit for the Consumer & Office Products segment decreased to $96 million in 2008 compared to $139 million in 2007. In 2008, earnings were negatively impacted by $38 million from lower volume, $28 million from higher input costs, $5 million from the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange and $9 million from other unfavorable items compared to 2007. In 2008, earnings benefited by $23 million from improved productivity and $14 million from improved product mix compared to 2007. Specialty Chemicals Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Sales $ 547 $ 494 Segment profit 1 48 37 1 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, minority interest income and losses and discontinued operations. The Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures, markets and distributes specialty chemicals derived from sawdust and other byproducts of the papermaking process in North America, South America and Asia. Products include activated carbon used in emission control systems for automobiles and trucks and performance chemicals used in printing inks, asphalt paving, adhesives and lubricants for the agricultural, paper and petroleum industries. Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment increased to $547 million in 2008 compared to $494 million in 2007. In 2008, improved pricing and product mix in most markets were partially offset by volume declines for carbon based products due to lower automobile production volumes in North America compared to 2007, and volume declines for printing ink resins due to weakness in the publication inks industry. Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment increased to $48 million in 2008 compared to $37 million in 2007. In 2008, earnings benefited by $53 million from improved pricing and product mix and $8 million from other favorable items compared to 2007. In 2008, earnings were negatively impacted by $28 million from higher input costs of energy, raw materials and freight and $22 million from unfavorable productivity compared to 2007. 21 Table of Contents Community Development and Land Management Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Sales 1 $ 135 $ 87 Segment profit 1,2 59 294 1 In 2008, sales of landholdings are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the strategic view and structure of the operations of the Community Development and Land Management segment established in 2008. For periods prior to 2008, gains from sales of landholdings are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. 2 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, minority interest income and losses and discontinued operations. During 2008, MWV established a real estate business to maximize the value of its land holdings. As a result, the company is presenting the Community Development and Land Management business as a separate segment for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was previously included in Corporate and Other. Results prior to 2008 have been recast to conform to the new segment structure. Profit for the Community Development and Land Management segment was $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Sales were $135 million in 2008 compared to $87 million in 2007. Profit in 2007 includes pre tax gains of $250 million related to sales of non strategic large tract forestlands. Profit from real estate activities related to small tract land sales was $40 million in 2008 compared to $24 million in 2007. Profit from forestry operations and leasing activities was $19 million in 2008 compared to $20 million in 2007. The company sold approximately 21,200 small tract acres for gross proceeds of $57 million in 2008 compared to approximately 7,900 acres for gross proceeds of $26 million in 2007. As the U.S. economy continued to weaken in 2008, the company shifted its marketing focus to smaller recreational properties primarily located in rural Alabama, Georgia and Virginia. The Community Development and Land Management segment is responsible for maximizing the value of the companys landholdings. Operations of the segment include real estate development, forestry operations and leasing activities. Real estate development includes (i) improving and selling rural tracts primarily for recreational and residential uses, (ii) entitling and improving high value tracts through joint ventures and other ownership arrangements, (iii) master planning select landholdings, and (iv) monetizing non core forestlands. Forestry operations include growing and harvesting softwood and hardwood on the companys forestlands for external consumption and for use by the companys mill based business. Leasing activities include fees from third parties undertaking mineral extraction operations, as well as fees from recreational leases on the companys forestlands. The goal of the Community Development and Land Management business is to create and manage a land portfolio capable of generating sustainable earnings and cash flow and maximizing shareholder value. To accomplish this goal, during 2008 the company evaluated its land portfolio to determine the potential maximum value for each tract and the real estate strategies for realizing those values. Based on our landholdings at December 31, 2008, management has determined that approximately 545,000 acres are most suitable for rural land sales, approximately 115,000 acres are developable and approximately 140,000 acres are strategic fiber sources for the companys mill operations with mineral extraction potential. Current segmentation may change as a result of the companys continuous evaluation of its landholdings for the highest and best use. Current real estate industry conditions remain challenging due to significant credit tightening and weaker consumer spending. These factors will likely continue to influence near term results. During this time, the company will continue to move forward with its near and long term real estate value creation plans, including enhancing rural land and entitling and master planning its highest potential development land. 22 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Sales 1 $ 105 $ 130 Corporate and Other loss 1, 2 (375 ) (466 ) 1 Results for 2007 have been recast to include certain costs previously associated with the discontinued operations of the Kraft business and to conform to the new segment structure adopted in 2008 reflecting the separate presentation of the Community Development and Land Management business previously included in Corporate and Other. 2 Corporate and Other loss includes minority interest income and losses, restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, and gains and losses on certain asset sales. Corporate and Other includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities, including merger related goodwill, and the Specialty Papers business. The results include income and expense items not directly associated with segment operations, such as certain legal settlements, net pension income, interest expense and income, sales of corporate real estate, restructuring charges and one time costs and other activities. Corporate and Other loss was $375 million in 2008 compared to a loss of $466 million in 2007. Contributing to the decreased loss in 2008 were lower restructuring charges and one time costs of $40 million, higher pension income of $35 million, higher interest income of $20 million, a gain of $15 million from the sale of corporate real estate, and $8 million from other net favorable items, partially offset by $27 million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2007. 23 Table of Contents Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Sales were $6.41 billion and $6.05 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Increased sales in 2007 were driven by the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business acquired in the third quarter of 2006, improved pricing and product mix and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by lower volumes compared to 2006. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information for each segment. Costs of sales were $5.26 billion and $4.96 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, pre tax input costs for energy, raw materials and freight included in cost of sales were $131 million higher compared to 2006. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $57 million and $53 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $870 million and $894 million, or 13.6% and 14.8% as a percentage of sales, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Lower expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower restructuring charges and one time costs, partially offset by the impact of the addition of the dispensing and spraying systems business acquired in the third quarter of 2006 and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Restructuring charges and one time costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $48 million in 2007 compared to $102 million in 2006. Pension income from continuing operations was $58 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Interest expense was $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and was comprised of $176 million related to bond and bank debt and $19 million related to other borrowings. Other income, net was $301 million and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Gains on sales of large tract forestlands $ (250 ) $ Gains on sales of small tract forestlands (24 ) (29 ) Gains on sales of other assets (29 ) Gain on sale of PIK note (21 ) Interest income (19 ) (20 ) Asset impairments 2 20 Foreign currency exchange gains (12 ) (1 ) Other, net 2 (3 ) $ (301 ) $ (83 ) The companys annual effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately 28% and (2)% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in the rate in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to a shift in the level and mix of domestic versus foreign earnings, including pre tax domestic gains from sales of forestlands of $274 million in 2007 compared to $29 million in 2006. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and Corporate and Other. 24 Table of Contents Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Sales 1 $ 2,504 $ 2,455 Segment profit 1, 2 281 244 1 Results for 2007 and 2006 have been recast to exclude the discontinued operations of the Kraft business. 2 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, minority interest income and losses and discontinued operations. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment increased to $2.50 billion in 2007 compared to $2.46 billion in 2006. Increased sales were driven by improved pricing and product mix, the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange and strengthened demand in key products. Shipments of bleached paperboard in 2007 were 1,575,000 tons, down 4% from 2006 reflecting, in part, a shift by the company away from lower value grades. Shipments of CNK in 2007 were 1,096,000 tons, down 3% from 2006, with declines in beverage sales partially offset by higher sales of general packaging grades. In 2007, bleached paperboard prices were up 4% and CNK prices were up 6% compared to 2006. Sales for the companys Brazilian packaging operation, Rigesa Ltda., increased 20% in 2007 over 2006 driven by higher volume and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by lower pricing.

Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment decreased to $37 million in 2007 compared to $51 million in 2006. In 2007, decreased earnings reflect higher input costs of energy, raw materials and freight of $25 million, volume declines of $11 million and other unfavorable items of $11 million, partially offset by improved pricing and product mix of $33 million compared to 2006. 26 Table of Contents Community Development and Land Management Years ended December 31, In millions 2007 2006 Sales 1 $ 87 $ 106 Segment profit 1, 2 294 53 1 Gains from sales of forestlands in 2007 and 2006 are included in segment profit and in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. 2 Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges and one time costs, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, minority interest income and losses and discontinued operations. Profit for the Community Development and Land Management segment was $294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Sales were $87 million in 2007 compared to $106 million in 2006 and were primarily related to forestry operations and leasing activities. Profit in 2007 includes pre tax gains of $250 million related to sales of non strategic large tract forestlands. Profit from real estate activities related to small tract land sales was $24 million in 2007 compared to $29 million in 2006. Profit from forestry operations and leasing activities was $20 million in 2007 compared to $24 million in 2006. The company sold approximately 7,900 small tract acres for gross proceeds of $26 million in 2007 compared to approximately 7,700 acres for gross proceeds of $30 million in 2006.

Corporate and Other loss was $466 million in 2007 compared to a loss of $488 million in 2006. In 2007 compared to 2006, lower restructuring charges and one time costs of $65 million and other favorable items of $1 million were partially offset by certain items reflected in the 2006 results including a $21 million gain from the sale of a PIK note, an $18 million gain from the sale of corporate real estate and $5 million in transition services income from New Page Corporation. 27 Table of Contents OUTLOOK 2009 Overview Given worldwide economic uncertainty, year over year results comparisons are difficult to predict. MWV is directly addressing the uncertain economic environment by remaining focused on the key items within its control that are expected to further strengthen the companys financial position including: vigilantly managing working capital usage; reducing discretionary spending, including pay freezes for salaried employees; reducing capital expenditures by narrowing investments on more immediate, high return investments; matching production with demand to reduce manufacturing cash costs, and; executing the broad cost reduction actions MWV announced on January 15, 2009. Cost management actions On January 15, 2009, MWV announced that it is implementing a series of broad cost reduction actions to further reduce its corporate and business unit overhead cost structure, optimize its manufacturing footprint, and realize sourcing savings throughout its supply chain. These actions are expected to result in the elimination of about 2,000 positions, or 10% of MWVs global workforce, and the closure or restructuring of 12 to 14 manufacturing facilities by the end of 2009. These cost management efforts are designed to achieve $125 million in pre tax savings in 2009, with a targeted run rate range of $250 million to $300 million by mid 2010. In connection with these actions, we expect to incur pre tax restructuring charges of $200 million to $250 million, of which $29 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the remainder to be recorded during 2009. The cash portion of these charges is expected to be $50 million to $60 million in 2009. Other items Capital spending was $288 million in 2008 and is expected to be about $250 million in 2009. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $472 million in 2008 and is expected to be about $450 million in 2009. Interest expense was $210 million in 2008 and is expected to be $200 million to $210 million in 2009. Management currently estimates pension income in 2009 to be about $60 million before the impact, if any, of a curtailment gain or loss due to a plan re measurement from actions under the 2008 strategic cost management initiative. In addition, the companys U.S. qualified retirement plans remain over funded and we do not anticipate any required regulatory funding contributions to such plans in the foreseeable future. Recent developments in global credit markets have not had a material impact on the companys investments and credit facilities. In addition, these developments have not had a material impact on the companys relationships with its current vendors and customers. Management will continue to monitor potential changes in the credit market and related markets which may have an impact on its businesses. Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the Forward looking Statements section later in this document. 28 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In response to current economic uncertainty and to enhance MWVs liquidity, we have prioritized cash generation as a key operating principle across our businesses. We are aggressively managing working capital usage and matching production to market demand, as well as suspending all non critical capital projects and limiting discretionary spending. Cash and cash equivalents were $549 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $245 million at December 31, 2007. The credit quality of our portfolio of short term investments remains appropriate with the majority of the companys cash and cash equivalents invested in U.S. government securities. Cash flow from operations and the companys current cash levels are expected to be adequate to fund scheduled debt payments, dividends to shareholders and capital expenditures in 2009. Capital spending is expected to be about $250 million in 2009, down from $288 million in 2008, and will be primarily allocated to productivity improvement initiatives and to safety and environmental compliance programs. In addition, the companys U.S. qualified retirement plans remain over funded and we do not anticipate any required regulatory funding contributions to such plans in the foreseeable future. MWV currently has $950 million of undrawn committed credit facilities. We continuously monitor the credit quality of our credit facility banks, insurance providers and derivative contract counter parties, in addition to our customers and key suppliers. The company has taken and will take further actions as necessary to mitigate any impact to its liquidity position; however, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to the company of any further disruption in global credit markets. Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $364 million in 2008, compared to $574 million in 2007 and $523 million in 2006. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 was primarily attributable to lower earnings. Cash generated from year over year working capital improvements was $24 million, $128 million and $138 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note Q of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for information related to changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations related to the Kraft business was $12 million, $67 million and $44 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $264 million in 2008, compared to $227 million in 2007 and $744 million in 2006. Proceeds from dispositions of assets generated $67 million in 2008, compared to $182 million in 2007 and $165 million in 2006. Capital spending from continuing operations totaled $288 million in 2008, compared to $329 million in 2007 and $285 million in 2006. Payments for acquired businesses, net of cash acquired and transaction costs, were $18 million in 2008, compared to $52 million in 2007 and $714 million in 2006. During 2008, we purchased Oracle Packaging to expand the companys leadership position in North American beverage packaging, and we jointly acquired International Labs, a pharmaceutical packaging company, with India based Bilcare Ltd. During 2007, we acquired two manufacturers of high quality, innovative dispensing and sprayer systems to strengthen our primary packaging offerings. During 2006, we acquired Saint Gobain Calmar, a leading global manufacturer of high quality and innovative dispensing and spraying systems, with manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. See related discussion in Note P of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Proceeds of the sale of a debt security generated $109 million in 2006. Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was $456 million in 2008, compared to cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations of $9 million in 2007 and $17 million in 2006. The increase in cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 was attributable to net cash proceeds of $466 million from the sale of the Kraft business, net of its capital expenditures and other cash outflows of $10 million. 29 Table of Contents Financing activities Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $200 million in 2008, compared to cash used in financing activities from continuing operations of $332 million in 2007 and cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations of $41 million in 2006. In 2008, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was driven by dividend payments of $159 million, long term debt payments of $36 million and other uses of funds of $13 million, offset in part by proceeds from other sources of funds of $8 million. Cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations was $7 million and $6 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. There was no cash flow from financing activities attributable to discontinued operations in 2008. The company has available a $750 million bank credit facility that expires in December 2010. Borrowings under this agreement can be in unsecured domestic or Eurodollar notes and at rates approximating Prime or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at the companys option. The $750 million revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant limiting the percentage of total debt (including a $338 million liability non recourse to MWV) to total capitalization (including deferred income tax liabilities) to 55% (as of December 31, 2008, the companys total debt to total capitalization as defined above was approximately 41%) as well as certain other covenants with which the company is in compliance. The revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2008 and 2007. In addition, the company has a $200 million secured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2009, which includes an option to extend for an additional period of up to one year if specified conditions are satisfied. Borrowings under this facility are secured by a portion of the companys trade receivables and bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin. The secured revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2008 and 2007. We continue to monitor the credit quality of our liquidity providers by evaluating credit ratings and credit default swap levels. In addition, we undertake similar measures and evaluate deposit concentrations to monitor the credit quality of the financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. The percentage of total debt to total capitalization for MWV was 45% at December 31, 2008 and 40% at December 31, 2007. During 2008, MWV terminated its entire portfolio of interest rate swaps on its fixed rate debt to mitigate any counter party credit risk and to realize its net favorable hedge positions at that time. As a result, all of the companys long term debt is at fixed rates. As a result of the swap terminations, the company realized $20 million in net cash proceeds, which are included in cash flows from operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The companys Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.92 per share, paying a total of $159 million, $169 million and $167 million of dividends to shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On January 26, 2009, the companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.23 per common share. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercises of stock options were $162 million and $53 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercises of stock options were less than $1 million in 2008. In 2007, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with a financial institution counterparty to purchase $400 million of the companys common stock. This program was funded by proceeds from sales of forestlands that closed in 2007. Pursuant to this program, the company received and retired 14.0 million shares. Under a separate share repurchase program, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares for $86 million in 2007. In 2006, the company repurchased and retired 1.3 million shares related to an obligation under a share put option to the former owner of a subsidiary. The cash impact of this transaction was $47 million. The 1.3 million shares repurchased under the put option were not a reduction of the share repurchases authorized by the Board of Directors in 2005. In 2007, the company received an installment note in the amount of $398 million (the Timber Note) as part of the consideration for the sale of certain large tract forestlands. The Timber Note does not require any principal payments until its maturity in October 2027 and bears interest at a rate approximating the LIBOR. In addition, the Timber Note is supported by a bank issued irrevocable letter of credit obtained by the buyer of the forestlands. Using the Timber Note as collateral, the company received $338 million in proceeds under a secured financing agreement with a bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the liability from this transaction is non recourse to MeadWestvaco and shall be paid from the Timber Note proceeds upon its maturity. As a result, the Timber Note is not available to satisfy the obligations of 30 Table of Contents MeadWestvaco. The non recourse liability does not require any principal payments until its maturity in October 2027 and bears interest at a rate approximating LIBOR. For further discussion related to this transaction, see Note D of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. In May of 2008, Moodys Investors Service lowered MeadWestvacos senior unsecured debt ratings to Ba1 from Baa3 with a stable outlook. In August of 2008, Standard and Poors Ratings Services revised its outlook on MeadWestvaco to negative from stable, lowered the companys short term credit rating to A 3 from A 2 and affirmed the companys BBB long term credit rating. These rating changes did not have a material financial impact to the company in 2008 and are not expected to have a material financial impact to the company in 2009. EFFECTS OF INFLATION Prices for energy, including natural gas, oil and electricity, and raw materials and freight, increased significantly in 2008 and 2007. The increase in these costs affected many of the companys businesses. During 2008, the pre tax input cost of energy, raw materials and freight attributable to continuing operations was $254 million higher than in 2007. During 2007, the pre tax input cost of energy, raw materials and freight attributable to continuing operations was $131 million higher than in 2006. ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over foreign operations of the company. Due to changes in environmental laws and regulations, the application of such regulations, and changes in environmental control technology, it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes. Taking these uncertainties into account, we estimate that we will incur $13 million and $32 million in environmental capital expenditures in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Approximately $16 million was spent on environmental capital projects in 2008. The company has been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or by various state or local governments that it may be liable under federal environmental laws or under applicable state or local laws with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances at sites previously operated or used by the company. The company is currently named as a potentially responsible party (PRP), or has received third party requests for contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state or local laws with respect to numerous sites. There are other sites which may contain contamination or which may be potential Superfund sites, but for which MeadWestvaco has not received any notice or claim. The potential liability for all these sites will depend upon several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, insurance coverage and contribution by other PRPs. The company regularly evaluates its potential liability at these various sites. At December 31, 2008, MeadWestvaco had recorded liabilities of approximately $19 million for estimated potential cleanup costs based upon its close monitoring of ongoing activities and its past experience with these matters. The company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with these sites may exceed amounts of recorded liabilities by an amount that could range from an insignificant amount to as much as $10 million. This estimate is less certain than the estimate upon which the environmental liabilities were based. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the companys results of operations. As with numerous other large industrial companies, the company has been named a defendant in asbestos related personal injury litigation. Typically, these suits also name many other corporate defendants. All of the claims against the company resolved to date have been concluded before trial, either through dismissal or through settlement with payments to the plaintiff that are not material to the company. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, have not been significant. As of December 31, 2008, there were approximately 591 lawsuits. Management believes that the company has substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. The company has valid defenses to these claims and intends to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on its historical experience in asbestos cases and an analysis of the current cases, the company believes that it has adequate amounts accrued for potential settlements and judgments in asbestos related litigation. At December 31, 2008, the company had recorded litigation 31 Table of Contents liabilities of approximately $21 million, a significant portion of which relates to asbestos. Should the volume of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that the company could incur significant costs resolving these cases. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the companys results of operations. MeadWestvaco is involved in various other litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the currently expected outcome of any matter, lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the companys results of operations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The company enters into various contractual obligations throughout the year. Presented below are the contractual obligations of the company as of December 31, 2008, and the time period in which payments under the obligations are due. Disclosures related to long term debt, capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations are included in the Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Also included below are disclosures regarding the amounts due under purchase obligations. A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The company has included in the disclosure below all normal and recurring purchase orders, take or pay contracts, supply arrangements as well as other purchase commitments that management believes meet the definition of purchase obligations above.

See Note N of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information. 32 Table of Contents SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS Discontinued operations On July 1, 2008, the company completed the sale of its Kraft business for net cash proceeds of $466 million. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $13 million ($8 million after tax). For 2008, the after tax gain on sale as well as the after tax operating results of the Kraft business are being reported as income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. Prior period amounts have been recast on a comparable basis. The results of operations and assets and liabilities of the Kraft business were previously included in the Packaging Resources segment. Income from discontinued operations was $10 million, or $0.06 per share, for 2008, $19 million, or $0.11 per share, for 2007, and $12 million, or $0.07 per share, for 2006. Refer to Note P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of the sale of the Kraft business and discontinued operations treatment. Restructuring charges Year ended December 31, 2008 During 2005, the company launched a cost initiative to improve the efficiency of its business model. The goal of this initiative was to reduce the overall cost structure of the company by $175 million to $200 million, before inflation, on an annual run rate basis. The company completed this program in December 2008, achieving estimated cumulative savings of about $190 million. In January 2009, the company announced a series of broad cost reduction actions including further reducing corporate and business unit overhead expense and closing or restructuring certain manufacturing locations. Restructuring costs incurred during 2008 were pursuant to both the 2005 cost initiative and the 2008 strategic cost management initiative. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the company incurred pre tax charges of $69 million in connection with employee separation costs, asset write downs and other restructuring actions of which $41 million, $26 million and $2 million was recorded within cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other income, net, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company incurred pre tax charges of $51 million of which $33 million and $18 million was recorded within cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. Although these charges related to individual segments, such amounts are included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes the accounting policies discussed below represent those accounting policies requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to reported results. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the companys disclosure. Environmental and legal liabilities: We record accruals for estimated environmental liabilities when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to the probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as availability of insurance coverage and contribution by other potentially responsible parties. Due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments, and changes in governmental regulations and environmental technologies, accruals are subject to substantial uncertainties, and actual costs could be materially greater or less than the estimated amounts. We record accruals for other legal contingencies, which are also subject to numerous uncertainties and variables associated with assumptions and judgments, when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Liabilities recorded for claims are limited to pending cases based on the companys historical experience, consultation with outside counsel and consultation with an actuarial specialist concerning the feasibility of reasonably estimating liabilities associated with claims that may arise in the future. We recognize insurance recoveries when collection is reasonably assured. Restructuring and other charges: We periodically record charges for the reduction of our workforce, the closure of manufacturing facilities and other actions related to business improvement and productivity initiatives. These events require estimates of liabilities for employee separation payments and related benefits, demolition, facility closures and other costs, which could differ from actual costs incurred. Pension and postretirement benefits: Assumptions used in the determination of net pension cost and postretirement benefit expense, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and increases in future compensation and medical costs, are evaluated by the company, reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate. Actual asset returns and compensation and medical costs, which are more favorable than assumptions, can have the effect of lowering expense and cash contributions, and, conversely, actual results, which are less favorable than assumptions, could increase expense and cash contributions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense in such future periods. In 2008, the company recorded pre tax pension income from continuing operations of $93 million, compared to $58 million in 2007 and $54 million in 2006. The company currently estimates overall pre tax pension income, before curtailments, in 2009 will decrease by approximately $20 million, primarily reflecting a change in the investment return assumption. The estimate assumes a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0%, and a discount rate of 6.25%. The company determined the discount rate by referencing the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The company believes that using a yield curve approach more accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled. Previously, the company referenced indices for long term, high quality bonds, ensuring that the durations of those indices were not materially different from the durations of the plans liabilities, or if different, that adjusting the discount rate would not have produced results that were materially different from using a common discount rate for all of its plans. If the expected rate of return on plan assets were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income in 2009 would change by approximately $16 million. Similarly, if the discount rate were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income would change by approximately $0.3 million. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate value of pension fund assets had decreased to $3.1 billion from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2007, reflecting overall unfavorable equity and fixed income market performance during 2008. For further details regarding pension fund assets, see Note K of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. 36 Table of Contents Prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses in the retirement and postretirement benefit plans subject to amortization are amortized over the average remaining service periods, which are about 10 years and 5 years, respectively, and are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2004, the company modified certain postretirement healthcare benefits to be provided to future retirees. This change reduced the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $68 million, and is being amortized over the remaining life of the eligible employees, which is approximately 24 years. Long lived assets useful lives: Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based on managements estimates of the periods over which the assets will be productively utilized in the revenue generation process or for other useful purposes. Factors that affect the determination of lives include prior experience with similar assets, product life expectations and industry practices. The determination of useful lives dictates the period over which tangible and intangible long lived assets are depreciated or amortized, typically using the straight line method. Impairment of long lived assets: We review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. The statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. For an asset that is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable judgment must be exercised as to determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to use in any value computations. Intangible assets: Business acquisitions often result in recording intangible assets. Intangible assets are recognized at the time of an acquisition, based upon their fair value. Similar to long lived tangible assets, intangible assets with finite lives are subject to periodic impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As with tangible assets, considerable judgment must be exercised. Periodic impairment reviews of intangible assets assigned an indefinite life are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. As with our review of impairment of tangible assets and goodwill, we employ significant assumptions in assessing our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment (primarily Calmar trademarks and trade names). An income approach (the relief from royalty method) is used to determine the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets. Although our estimate of fair values of the companys indefinite lived intangible assets under the income approach exceed the respective carrying values, different assumptions regarding projected performance and other factors could result in significant non cash impairment charges in the future. Based on our annual review of our indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2008, there was no indication of impairment. Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As with tangible and other intangible assets, periodic impairment reviews are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. We review the recorded value of our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. As with our review of impairment of tangible and intangible assets, we employ significant assumptions in assessing goodwill for impairment. An income approach is generally used to determine the fair values of our reporting units. 37 Table of Contents In applying the income approach in assessing goodwill for impairment, changes in assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for a reporting unit. Although our fair value estimates of the companys reporting units under the income approach exceed the respective carrying values, different assumptions regarding projected performance and other factors could result in significant non cash impairment charges in the future, particularly for the reporting units included in the Consumer Solutions segment. The following assumptions are key to our income approach: Business projections Projections are based on three year forecasts that are developed internally by management for use in managing the business that are updated quarterly and reviewed by the companys Board of Directors. These projections include significant assumptions such as estimates of future revenues, profits, working capital requirements, operating plans, costs of planned restructuring actions and capital expenditures. Assumptions surrounding macro economic data and estimates include industry projections, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and costs of energy, raw materials and freight. Growth rates A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of a reporting unit. The growth rate is the expected rate at which a reporting units earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the three year forecast period. Discount rates Future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant. The weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. The discount rates selected for the reporting units are based on existing conditions within the respective markets and reflect appropriate adjustments for potential risk premiums in those markets as well as appropriate weighting of the market cost of equity versus debt, which is developed with the assistance of external financial advisors. Tax rates Tax rates are based on estimates of the tax rates in the respective primary markets and geographic areas in which the reporting units operate. Based on our annual review of the recorded value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2008, there was no indication of impairment. Holding other valuation assumptions constant, it would take a downward shift in operating profits of more than approximately 20% across all periods from projected levels before the fair values of the reporting units included in the Consumer Solutions segment would be below the respective carrying values, thereby triggering the requirement to perform further analysis which may indicate potential goodwill impairment. At December 31, 2008, goodwill allocated to the reporting units included in the Consumer Solutions segment was $556 million. During the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009, the market price of our common stock has been subject to substantial volatility. While we considered the companys recent market capitalization decline below its book value, we determined it was not a triggering event at year end and therefore no interim goodwill impairment test was performed. The continuation of our stock price trading below book value per share, adverse changes in expected operating results of our reporting units, or significant unfavorable changes in other economic factors may require us to reassess goodwill for potential impairment prior to the annual evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2009. Although a potential non cash impairment charge could have a material adverse affect on the companys consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet, it would not have an adverse affect on our overall compliance with the covenants of our bond indentures and debt agreements. 38 Table of Contents Revenue recognition: We recognize revenue at the point when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through product sales, and shipping terms generally indicate when title and the risk of ownership have passed. Revenue is recognized at shipment for sales when shipping terms are FOB (free on board) shipping point unless risk of loss is maintained under freight terms. For sales where shipping terms are FOB destination, revenue is recognized when the goods are received by the customer. We provide for all allowances for estimated returns and other customer credits such as discounts and volume rebates, when the revenue is recognized, based on historical experience, current trends and any notification of pending returns. The customer allowances are, in many instances, subjective and are determined with significant management judgment and are reviewed regularly to determine the adequacy of the amounts. Changes in economic conditions, markets and customer relationships may require adjustments to these allowances from period to period. Also included in net sales is service revenue which is recognized as the service is performed. Revenue is recognized for leased equipment to customers on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the lease and is included in net sales of the company. In 2008, sales of landholdings are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the strategic view and structure of the operations of the Community Development and Land Management segment established in 2008. For periods prior to 2008, gains from sales of landholdings are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Income taxes: Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws. We evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment, including the forecast of future taxable income and the valuation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made. The company has tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. In the preparation of the companys financial statements, management exercises judgments in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and applies the guidance pursuant to FIN 48 which employs a more likely than not criteria approach for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. While actual results could vary, in managements judgment, the company has adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters. Each quarter, management must estimate our effective tax rate for the full year. This estimate includes assumptions about the level of income that will be achieved for the full year in both our domestic and international operations. The forecast of full year earnings includes assumptions about markets in each of our businesses as well as the timing of certain transactions, including forestland sales gains and restructuring charges. Should business performance or the timing of certain transactions change during the year, the level of income achieved may not meet the level of income estimated earlier in the year at interim periods. This change in the income levels and mix of earnings can result in significant adjustments to the tax provision in the quarter in which the estimate is refined. 39 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. See Note N of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for discussion of the effects of this accounting change. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies to existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement as the relevant measurement attribute. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which it is initially applied. As permitted by FASB Staff Position FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, the company deferred the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities until January 1, 2009, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), for which the date of adoption was January 1, 2008. The partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on the companys 2008 consolidated financial statements and the full adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. The following information is presented for financial assets and financial liabilities which are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as of December 31, 2008. The measurements of fair value are made on a recurring basis. In millions December 31, 2008 Level 1 (1) Level 2 (2) Level 3 (3) Derivatives liabilities $ (21 ) $ $ (21 ) $ Cash equivalents 381 381 Total $ 360 $ 381 $ (21 ) $ (1) Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. (2) Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. (3) Significant unobservable inputs. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in its balance sheet and to recognize the changes in the plans funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the change occurs. These provisions of the Statement are effective as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its fiscal year end, which is the Companys measurement date. Pursuant to the Statements adoption, the net after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $57 million. This adjustment principally represents the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial losses and the impact of recording additional minimum liabilities for certain under funded plans. This Statement will not affect the companys funding obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and we do not currently anticipate any required company contributions to the U.S. qualified retirement plans in the foreseeable future. 40 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159) . This Statement permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, which would result in the reporting of unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis, with few exceptions, as long as it is applied to the instrument in its entirety. The Statement establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of an entitys election on its earnings, but does not eliminate the disclosure requirements of other accounting standards. This Statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year in which it is initially applied. The company did not exercise the fair value option available under SFAS 159, and therefore the adoption of SFAS 159 did not have an effect on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). This Statement replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including those arising from contractual contingencies, any contingent consideration, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the statement. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values (or other amounts determined in accordance with SFAS No. 141(R)). In addition, SFAS No. 141(R)s requirement to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value will result in recognizing the goodwill attributable to the noncontrolling interest in addition to that attributable to the acquirer. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This Statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest, and requires disclosure on the face of the consolidated statements of operations of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal periods, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. 41 Table of Contents In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,(FSP No. FAS 132(R) 1) which provides guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. FSP No. 132(R) 1 requires disclosures that provide users of financial statements with an understanding of how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. FSP No. 132(R) 1 is effective for years ending after December 15, 2009 and adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards issued in 2008 that had or are expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. 42 Table of Contents Forward looking Statements Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such information includes, without limitation, the business outlook, assessment of market conditions, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, future plans, contingencies and contemplated transactions of the company. Such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause or contribute to actual results of company operations, or the performance or achievements of each company, or industry results, to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any such risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere herein, risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied for the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances which affect the ability of MeadWestvaco to realize improvements in operating earnings from the companys ongoing cost reduction initiatives; the ability of MeadWestvaco to close announced and pending transactions, including divestitures; the reorganization of the companys packaging business units; competitive pricing for the companys products; impact from inflation on raw materials, energy and other costs; fluctuations in demand and changes in production capacities; relative growth or decline in the United States and international economies; government policies and regulations, including, but not limited to those affecting the environment and the tobacco industry; the companys continued ability to reach agreement with its unionized employees on collective bargaining agreements; the companys ability to execute its plans to divest or otherwise realize the greater value associated with its land holdings; adverse results in current or future litigation; currency movements; volatility and further deterioration of the capital markets; and other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in other filings made from time to time with the SEC. MeadWestvaco undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures made on related subjects in the companys reports filed with the SEC. 43 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Interest rates The company has developed a targeted mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt as part of an overall strategy to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To efficiently manage this mix, the company may utilize interest rate swap agreements. Due to market conditions in the latter part of 2008, the company took a more conservative interest rate position and terminated its interest rate swaps on its fixed rate debt. As a result, at December 31, 2008 there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. Foreign currency The company has foreign based operations, primarily in South America, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia, which accounted for approximately 34% of its 2008 net sales. In addition, certain of the companys domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of its foreign operations, the company also makes intercompany sales and receives royalties and dividends denominated in many different currencies. All of this exposes the company to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of the companys domestic operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in the companys financial statements. The companys foreign currency management policy permits it to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold, which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations. During 2008 and 2007, the company entered into foreign currency hedges to partially offset the foreign currency impact of these flows on operating income. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. The company also issues intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, exposing it to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates. Generally, management uses foreign exchange hedge contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge these exposures. When applied to the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments at December 31, 2008, a 10% adverse change in currency rates would have about a $25 million effect on the companys results. Natural gas In order to better predict and control the future cost of natural gas consumed at the companys mills and plants, the company engages in financial hedging of future gas purchase prices. Gas usage is relatively predictable month by month. The company hedges primarily with financial instruments that are priced based on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas futures contracts. See Note G of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. 44 Table of Contents
