Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations OVERVIEW For the year ended December 31, 2010, MeadWestvaco Corporation (MeadWestvaco, MWV, or the company) reported net income attributable to the company from continuing operations of $262 million, or $1.52 per share. These results include after tax restructuring charges of $35 million, or $0.20 per share, tax benefits from cellulosic biofuel producer credits and audit settlements of $29 million, or $0.17 per share, after tax gains from pension curtailments of $5 million, or $0.03 per share, and a charge from early extinguishment of debt of $4 million, or $0.02 per share. Comparable results for prior years are noted later in this discussion. Sales from continuing operations increased 5% to $5.69 billion in 2010 compared to $5.41 billion in 2009. Increased sales were driven by higher volumes and improved pricing and product mix resulting from strong commercial execution in MWVs targeted global markets, as well as from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. These positive effects on sales in 2010 were partially offset by negative volume impacts stemming from continued strategic exits from low return products. Participation in emerging markets, including Asia and Brazil, continues to produce favorable results with related sales increasing 15% in 2010. Revenues from emerging markets currently comprise approximately 27% of the companys total sales. Pre tax earnings on a continuing operations basis from the companys segments increased 29% to $731 million in 2010 compared to $568 million in 2009. Improved results reflect MWVs continued success of growing profitably in attractive global packaging and other markets, reducing overhead costs and improving the overall productivity of the companys manufacturing facilities and supply chain. All of the manufacturing segments contributed to the significant year over year improvement, with strong earnings from the packaging and specialty chemicals businesses. The companys liquidity and financial position remain excellent and cash flow from continuing operations totaled $551 million in 2010. Strong free cash flow in 2010 allowed the company to repay debt prior to scheduled maturities of $120 million, as well as repurchase and retire 3.9 million shares of MWVs common stock for $92 million. During 2010, the company paid $160 million of dividends to shareholders and increased its quarterly dividend approximately 9% to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter. The companys U.S. qualified retirement plans remain well over funded and management does not anticipate any required regulatory funding contributions to such plans in the foreseeable future. Looking ahead to the first half of 2011, the company expects to achieve year over year margin and earnings improvement. Positive factors in the companys outlook include stable to strengthening demand trends in targeted global markets along with continued momentum with commercial strategies focused on business mix improvement and further penetration in growing emerging markets. The company also expects to achieve additional improvements in productivity across its manufacturing platform. Negative factors in the companys outlook include higher costs for energy, freight and certain raw materials due to the rising price of oil. The company is continuing to monitor ongoing macro economic developments and is prepared to respond to additional challenges. Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the Forward looking Statements section located later in this document. 15 Table of Contents On November 30, 2010, the company acquired a leading trigger sprayer manufacturer with operations located in Europe for $60 million. The all plastic product portfolio of this business is used throughout household and industrial cleaning, automotive and agricultural markets. This acquisition better positions MWV for growth in these global markets, and further meets consumer demand for more ergonomic, high performing and environment friendly products. Refer to Note Q of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. On September 30, 2010, the company completed the sale of its media and entertainment packaging business. On February 1, 2011, the company completed the sale of its envelope products business. For the current and prior year periods, the company is reporting these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Results from discontinued operations in 2010 were an after tax loss of $156 million reflecting a combined after tax loss of $141 million in accounting for these dispositions and a combined after tax loss of $15 million from operations. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes MWVs results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. All references to per share amounts are presented on an after tax basis. Years ended December 31, In millions, except per share data 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 5,693 $ 5,406 $ 5,809 Cost of sales 4,472 4,446 4,832 Selling, general and administrative expenses 729 755 715 Interest expense 186 195 199 Other income, net (14 ) (382 ) (32 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 320 392 95 Income tax provision 54 152 4 Income from continuing operations 266 240 91 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (156 ) (15 ) (1 ) Net income 110 225 90 Net income attributable to non controlling interests 4 Net income attributable to the company $ 106 $ 225 $ 90 Income from continuing operations attributable to the company $ 262 $ 240 $ 91 Net income per share basic: Income from continuing operations $ 1.54 $ 1.40 $ 0.52 Loss from discontinued operations (0.92 ) (0.09 ) Net income attributable to the company $ 0.62 $ 1.31 $ 0.52 Net income per share diluted: Income from continuing operations $ 1.52 $ 1.38 $ 0.52 Loss from discontinued operations (0.90 ) (0.08 ) Net income attributable to the company $ 0.62 $ 1.30 $ 0.52 16 Table of Contents Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Sales from continuing operations were $5.69 billion and $5.41 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Increased sales were driven by higher volumes and improved pricing and product mix resulting from strong commercial execution in MWVs targeted global markets, as well as from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. These positive effects on sales in 2010 were partially offset by negative volume impacts stemming from continued strategic exits from low return products. Participation in emerging markets, including Asia and Brazil, continues to produce favorable results with related sales increasing 15% in 2010. Revenues from emerging markets currently comprise approximately 27% of the companys total sales. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information. Costs of sales were $4.47 billion and $4.45 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010, increased costs due to higher volumes and input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight more than offset the benefits from productivity improvements and overhead cost reductions compared to 2009. In 2010, input costs for energy, raw materials and freight included in cost of sales were $110 million higher compared to 2009. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $35 million and $137 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $729 million and $755 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Benefits in 2010 from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions more than offset increased costs associated with investments for new product development and to accelerate profitable growth in emerging markets, as well as increased costs of implementing information technology systems and related processes for certain European operations compared to 2009. Restructuring charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $18 million and $36 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Pension income from continuing operations was $78 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Pension income from continuing operations includes curtailment gains of $2 million and $6 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, pursuant to employee reductions associated with the companys 2008 and 2005 strategic cost management programs. Pension income is included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Pension income is expected to be about $80 million in 2011. Interest expense was $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and was comprised of $154 million related to bond and bank debt, $2 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $20 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $10 million related to other borrowings. Interest expense was $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and was comprised of $157 million related to bond and bank debt, $4 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $20 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $14 million related to other borrowings. 17 Table of Contents Other income, net was $14 million and $382 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Interest income $ (22 ) $ (18 ) Charges from early extinguishments of debt 6 23 Foreign currency exchange losses (gains) 4 (2 ) Gains on sales of assets (16 ) Alternative fuel mixture credit (1) (375 ) Other, net (2 ) 6 $ (14 ) $ (382 ) (1) Through December 31, 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allowed an excise tax credit for alternative fuel mixtures produced by a taxpayer for use as a fuel in a taxpayers trade or business. The companys effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 17% and 39% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the mix and levels of pre tax earnings between the companys domestic and foreign operations, including pre tax domestic income of $375 million from alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009, as well as the effects from certain items in 2010 including tax benefits from an internal reorganization of a domestic entity, tax benefits from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Credit and tax charges from domestic and foreign tax audits. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of the companys segments and certain items included in Corporate and Other. MWVs segments are (i) Packaging Resources, (ii) Consumer Solutions, (iii) Consumer & Office Products, (iv) Specialty Chemicals, and (v) Community Development and Land Management. Refer to Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a reconciliation of the sum of the results of the segments and Corporate and Other to consolidated income from continuing operations attributable to the company before income taxes. Restructuring charges are included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Refer to the discussion included in Significant Transactions herein below for restructuring charges attributable to the companys segments. 18 Table of Contents Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ 2,670 $ 2,446 Segment profit 1 257 182 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Packaging Resources segment produces paperboard used in packaging for food, beverage, tobacco, healthcare, and beauty and personal care markets. This segments products include bleached paperboard (SBS) and Coated Natural Kraft&reg; paperboard (CNK&reg;) that are manufactured at three mills located in the U.S. and corrugated packaging that is manufactured at two mills located in Brazil. SBS is used for packaging high value consumer products including frozen and dry food, aseptic liquid packaging, disposable cups, tobacco, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. CNK&reg; is used for a range of packaging applications, the largest of which for MWV is multi pack beverage packaging and food packaging. MWVs corrugated packaging business is focused on fresh produce, frozen meat and consumer products markets in South America. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment were $2.67 billion in 2010 compared to $2.45 billion in 2009. Sales increased in 2010 due to higher volume and improved pricing and product mix, as well as from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. Shipments of SBS were approximately 1,363,000 tons in 2010, relatively unchanged from 2009. Shipments of CNK&reg; were 1,013,000 tons in 2010, up 6% from 2009, as demand continued to recover for beverage and retail food packaging. In 2010, SBS prices were up 6% while CNK&reg; prices were relatively unchanged compared to 2009. Backlogs for SBS and CNK&reg; are currently at four to five weeks. Sales by the segments Brazilian operation, Rigesa, were 24% higher in 2010 due to favorable foreign currency exchange and improved pricing and product mix, as well as from increased volume compared to 2009. Profit for the Packaging Resources segment was $257 million in 2010 compared to $182 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $122 million from improved pricing and product mix, $64 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions and $18 million from increased volume compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $97 million from input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight, $25 million from increased costs due to reduced fiber availability from severe weather in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2010 and $7 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2009. 19 Table of Contents Consumer Solutions Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 2 Sales $ 1,818 $ 1,847 Segment profit 1 125 94 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. (2) Results for 2009 have been recast to exclude the discontinued operations of the media and entertainment packaging business. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. The Consumer Solutions segment designs and produces packaging solutions and systems for the food, beverage, tobacco, beauty and personal care, healthcare, and home and garden markets. This segment manufactures multi pack cartons primarily for the global beverage take home market, high end packaging for the global tobacco market, injection molded plastic packaging for prescription drugs, and dispensing and sprayer systems for personal care, fragrance, healthcare, home cleaning, and garden and lawn maintenance products. Paperboard and plastic are converted into packaging products at plants located in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. This segment also has pharmaceutical packaging contracts with retailers, including mass merchants. In addition, this segment manufactures equipment that is leased or sold to its beverage and dairy customers to package their products. Sales for the Consumer Solutions segment were $1.82 billion in 2010 compared to $1.85 billion in 2009. Sales declined in 2010 due to the impact stemming from deliberate exits from low return products, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. The effects of these items in 2010 were partially offset by growth in emerging markets, as well as from improved overall pricing and product mix compared to 2009. Profit for the Consumer Solutions segment was $125 million in 2010 compared to $94 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $55 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions, $8 million from improved pricing and product mix, $1 million from increased volume and $10 million from foreign currency exchange and other items, including the impact from strategic actions to eliminate low return products, compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $43 million from input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight compared to 2009. 20 Table of Contents Consumer & Office Products Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 2 Sales $ 748 $ 749 Segment profit 1 141 137 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. (2) Results for 2009 have been recast to exclude the discontinued operations of the envelope products business. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. The Consumer & Office Products segment manufactures, sources, markets and distributes school and office products and time management products in North America and Brazil through both retail and commercial channels. MWV produces many of the leading brand names in school supplies, time management and commercial office products, including AMCAL&reg;, AT A GLANCE&reg;, Cambridge&reg;, Day Runner&reg;, Five Star&reg;, Mead&reg; and Trapper Keeper&reg;. Sales for the Consumer & Office Products segment were $748 million in 2010 compared to $749 million in 2009. In 2010, the segment had a solid back to school season in North America lead by its Mead&reg; and FiveStar&reg; line up despite modestly lower sales as increased school volumes were more than offset by an unfavorable mix of products compared to 2009. Sales for dated and time management products in 2010 were also lower than 2009 due to the segments continued strategy of exiting low return product lines. During 2010, sales in Brazil declined compared to 2009 as a shift in timing of the back to school season in Brazil moved some volume into 2011. Sales in 2010 benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. The segment continues to be impacted by imports from Asia. Profit for the Consumer & Office Products segment was $141 million in 2010 compared to $137 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $34 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $14 million from unfavorable product mix, $11 million from input cost inflation primarily for certain raw materials and freight and $5 million from lower volume compared to 2009. Specialty Chemicals Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ 680 $ 503 Segment profit 1 141 56 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures, markets and distributes specialty chemicals derived from sawdust and other byproducts of the papermaking process in North America, Europe, South America and Asia. Products include activated carbon used in gas vapor emission control systems for automobiles and trucks and applications for air, water and food purification. Other products include performance chemicals used in printing inks, asphalt paving and adhesives, as well as in the agricultural, paper and petroleum industries. 21 Table of Contents Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment were $680 million in 2010 compared to $503 million in 2009. Sales increased in 2010 from significantly higher volumes and improved pricing and product mix due to strong demand for pine chemicals and activated carbon, as well as strong demand for the segments asphalt solutions in emerging markets. Sales in 2010 also benefited from increased sales of chemicals for oil field services, adhesives, printing inks and water and food purification applications, as well as from increased automotive production in North America, Europe and emerging markets compared to 2009. Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment was $141 million in 2010 compared to $56 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $41 million from improved pricing and product mix, $25 million from increased volume, $11 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions and $9 million from input cost deflation compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $1 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2009. Community Development and Land Management Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ 168 $ 193 Segment profit 1 67 99 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Community Development and Land Management segment is responsible for maximizing the value of the companys landholdings in the Southeastern region of the U.S. Operations of the segment include real estate development, forestry operations and leasing activities. Real estate development includes (i) selling non core forestlands primarily for recreational and residential uses, (ii) entitling and improving high value tracts, and (iii) master planning select landholdings. Forestry operations include growing and harvesting softwood and hardwood on the companys forestlands for external consumption and for use by the companys mill based business. Leasing activities include fees from third parties undertaking mineral extraction operations, as well as fees from recreational leases on the companys forestlands. Sales for the Community Development and Land Management segment were $168 million in 2010 compared to $193 million in 2009. Profit was $67 million in 2010 compared to $99 million in 2009. Profit from real estate activities was $55 million in 2010 versus $88 million in 2009. In 2010, the company sold approximately 25,130 acres for gross proceeds of $80 million versus approximately 59,700 acres for gross proceeds of $118 million in 2009. Profit from forestry operations and leasing activities was $12 million in 2010 compared to $11 million in 2009. The real estate sector remains challenging due to weak consumer spending. These factors will likely continue to influence near term results. During this time, the segment will continue to move forward with its near and long term real estate value creation plans, including enhancing rural land, and entitling and master planning its highest potential development land. 22 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ $ 49 Corporate and Other loss (415 ) (176 ) Corporate and Other includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities, including merger related goodwill, and the companys specialty papers operation which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2009. The results also include income and expense items not directly associated with ongoing business segment operations, such as income from alternative fuel mixture credits, restructuring charges, charges from early extinguishments of debt, pension income and curtailment gains, interest expense and income, non controlling interest income and losses, certain legal settlements, gains and losses on certain asset sales and other items. Corporate and Other loss was $415 million in 2010 compared to a loss of $176 million in 2009. Contributing to the higher loss in 2010 was income from alternative fuel mixture credits of $375 million recorded in 2009. The loss in 2010 also reflects lower restructuring charges of $120 million, lower interest expense of $9 million and other net favorable items of $7 million compared to 2009. Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Sales from continuing operations were $5.41 billion and $5.81 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Decreased sales in 2009 were primarily driven by lower demand for packaged goods due to weak global economic conditions, as well as from unfavorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2008. Decreased sales in 2009 also reflect negative volume impacts stemming from strategic exits of low return products. These negative effects on sales in 2009 were partially offset by improved pricing and product mix in targeted global packaging markets, including growth from new products and packaging sales from emerging markets, as well as higher land sales compared to 2008. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information. Costs of sales were $4.45 billion and $4.83 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Decreased cost of sales in 2009 was primarily driven by lower volumes and lower input costs for energy, raw materials and freight compared to 2008. In 2009, input costs for energy, raw materials and freight included in cost of sales were $120 million lower compared to 2008. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $137 million and $31 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $755 million and $715 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Benefits in 2009 from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions were partially offset by higher performance based compensation compared to 2008. Restructuring charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $36 million and $19 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pension income from continuing operations was $73 million and $98 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pension income from continuing operations includes curtailment gains of $6 million and $11 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, pursuant to employee reductions associated with the companys 2008 and 2005 strategic cost management programs. Interest expense was $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and was comprised of $157 million related to bond and bank debt, $4 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $20 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $14 million related to other 23 Table of Contents borrowings. Interest expense was $199 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and was comprised of $153 million related to bond and bank debt, $13 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $17 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $16 million related to other borrowings. Other income, net was $382 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Alternative fuel mixture credit $ (375 ) $ Charges from early extinguishments of debt 23 Interest income (18 ) (39 ) Gains on sales of certain assets (16 ) (16 ) Foreign currency exchange (gains) losses (2 ) 25 Other, net 6 (2 ) $ (382 ) $ (32 ) The companys effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was approximately 39% and 4% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to the mix and levels of pre tax earnings between the companys domestic and foreign operations, including pre tax domestic income of $375 million from alternative fuel mixture credits in 2009, as well as from tax charges related to domestic and foreign tax audits in 2009. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of the companys segments and certain items included in Corporate and Other. Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Sales $ 2,446 $ 2,667 Segment profit 1 182 195 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment were $2.45 billion in 2009 compared to $2.67 billion in 2008. Shipments of SBS in 2009 were 1,350,000 tons, down 18% from 2008, reflecting lower demand and a shift by the segment away from lower value paperboard grades. In connection with this strategy, the segment removed approximately 200,000 tons of annual SBS paperboard capacity pursuant to the permanent shutdown of a paperboard machine at its Evadale, Texas mill during 2009. Shipments of CNK&reg; in 2009 were 951,000 tons, down 9% from 2008, primarily reflecting lower demand and higher maintenance related downtime. In 2009, SBS prices were up 5% and CNK&reg; prices were up 6% compared to 2008. Sales by the segments Brazilian operation, Rigesa, decreased 13% in 2009 due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency exchange, unfavorable product mix and modestly lower volume compared to 2008. 24 Table of Contents Profit for the Packaging Resources segment was $182 million in 2009 compared to $195 million in 2008. Profit in 2009 was negatively impacted by $142 million from lower volume and $24 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2008. Profit in 2009 benefited by $79 million from productivity initiatives, overhead reduction actions and input cost deflation and $74 million from improved pricing and product mix compared to 2008. Consumer Solutions Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2 2008 2 Sales $ 1,847 $ 1,975 Segment profit 1 94 48 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. (2) Results for 2009 and 2008 have been recast to exclude the discontinued operations of the media and entertainment packaging business. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. Sales for the Consumer Solutions segment were $1.85 billion in 2009 compared to $1.98 billion in 2008. In 2009, overall volume was down compared to 2008 due to lower demand for premium products and declines in consumer spending, as well as negative volume impacts stemming from deliberate exits of low return products. In addition, sales declined in 2009 due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2008. These effects on sales in 2009 were partially offset by continued strong demand for the companys value added Shellpak&reg; solution within the healthcare market and for dispensing solutions for soaps and antibacterial lotions in personal care markets due to the heightened global awareness of the H1N1 virus. In addition, the segment benefited from increased demand in the emerging Asia beverage market. Profit for the Consumer Solutions segment was $94 million in 2009 compared to $48 million in 2008. Profit in 2009 benefited by $107 million from productivity initiatives, overhead reduction actions and input cost deflation compared to 2008. Profit in 2009 was negatively impacted by $13 million from input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight, $11 million from unfavorable pricing and product mix, $9 million from lower volume and $28 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2008. 25 Table of Contents Consumer & Office Products Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2 2008 2 Sales $ 749 $ 753 Segment profit 1 137 97 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. (2) Results for 2009 and 2008 have been recast to exclude the discontinued operations of the envelope products business. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. Sales for the Consumer & Office Products segment were $749 million in 2009 compared to $753 million in 2008. During 2009, the segment had a solid back to school season in North America with higher volumes offset by a slightly weaker product mix which led a modest increase of sales on strong positioning and sell through of proprietary, branded products at leading retailers. Sales for dated and time management products were down as a result of the planned exit of low return product lines, as well as an expected decline in base business. The volume decline was offset by better overall product mix. Sales for Tilibra were lower as volumes were impacted by the timing of customer orders but this volume decline was offset in part by improved product mix. The segment augmented its school and office supplies business with the acquisition of Grafons&reg; during the third quarter of 2009, a provider of branded consumer products in Brazil, and has integrated its products and licensing agreements into the segments school offerings in the Southern Hemisphere. Profit for the Consumer & Office Products segment was $137 million in 2009 compared to $97 million in 2008. Profit in 2009 benefited by $52 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions and $2 million from improved product mix compared to 2008. Profit in 2009 was negatively impacted by $13 million from lower volume and $1 million from other unfavorable items compared to 2008. Specialty Chemicals Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Sales $ 503 $ 547 Segment profit 1 56 48 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment were $503 million in 2009 compared to $547 million in 2008. In 2009, lower overall volume more than offset improved pricing and product mix compared to 2008. While demand in 2009 for pine chemicals and automotive carbon were below 2008 levels, the segment benefited from stronger global demand for its asphalt solutions, increased demand for carbon technologies in water and food purification markets, and share gains in pine chemicals for oilfield and adhesive applications compared to 2008. 26 Table of Contents Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment was $56 million in 2009 compared to $48 million in 2008. Profit in 2009 benefited by $46 million from productivity initiatives, overhead reduction actions and input cost deflation, and $2 million from improved product mix compared to 2008. Profit in 2009 was negatively impacted by $33 million from lower volume and $7 million from other unfavorable items compared to 2008. Community Development and Land Management Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Sales $ 193 $ 135 Segment profit 1 99 59 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. Sales for the Community Development and Land Management segment were $193 million in 2009 compared to $135 million in 2008. Profit was $99 million in 2009 compared to $59 million in 2008. Profit from real estate activities was $88 million in 2009 versus $40 million in 2008. In 2009, the company sold approximately 59,700 acres for gross proceeds of $118 million versus approximately 21,200 acres for gross proceeds of $57 million in 2008. Profit from forestry operations and leasing activities was $11 million in 2009 compared to $19 million in 2008. Corporate and Other Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Sales $ 49 $ 106 Corporate and Other loss (176 ) (352 ) Corporate and Other loss was $176 million in 2009 compared to a loss of $352 million in 2008. Contributing to the lower loss in 2009 was income from alternative fuel mixture credits of $375 million recorded in 2009. The loss in 2009 also reflects higher restructuring charges of $121 million, lower pension income of $25 million, charges from the early extinguishments of debt of $23 million in 2009, an expense of $20 million from a contribution to the MeadWestvaco Foundation in 2009 and other net unfavorable items of $10 million compared to 2008. 27 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flow from continuing operations and the companys current cash levels are expected to be adequate to fund scheduled debt payments, dividends to shareholders and the majority of MWVs capital expenditures in 2011. In addition, the companys U.S. qualified retirement plans remain well over funded and management does not anticipate any required regulatory funding contributions to such plans in the foreseeable future. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $790 million at December 31, 2010. The credit quality of the portfolio of short term investments remains strong with the majority of cash and cash equivalents invested in U.S. government securities. The company currently has $600 million of undrawn bank committed credit capacity. Management continuously monitors the credit quality of the companys credit facility banks, insurance providers and derivative contract counter parties, in addition to customers and key suppliers. Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $551 million in 2010, compared to $831 million in 2009 and $317 million in 2008. The decline in cash flow in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects higher receipts of alternative fuel mixture credits of $292 million in 2009 compared to 2010, partially offset by improved year over year segment earnings in 2010. Cash used by operating activities from discontinued operations was $5 million in 2010, compared to cash provided by discontinued operations of $45 million and $59 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $279 million in 2010, compared to $211 million in 2009 and $245 million in 2008. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2010 was driven by capital expenditures of $242 million, payments for acquired businesses (net of cash acquired) of $49 million, contributions to joint ventures of $9 million and other uses of funds of $10 million, offset in part by proceeds from dispositions of assets of $31 million. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2009 was driven by capital expenditures of $218 million, payments for acquired businesses (net of cash acquired) of $15 million, contributions to joint ventures of $5 million and other uses of funds of $25 million, offset in part by proceeds from dispositions of assets of $52 million. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2008 was driven by capital expenditures of $274 million, payments for acquired businesses (net of cash acquired) of $18 million, contributions to joint ventures of $15 million and other uses of funds of $5 million, offset in part by proceeds from dispositions of assets of $67 million. Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was $59 million in 2010, compared to $2 million in 2009 and $437 million in 2008. Cash flows provided by discontinued operations primarily relate to proceeds received from dispositions of certain businesses. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information on discontinued operations. Capital spending in 2011 associated with productivity and growth initiatives, as well as maintenance capital and environmental compliance, is expected to range from $300 million to $350 million. Funding for this range is expected to be primarily from current cash levels and cash flow from operations. Capital spending in 2011 associated with expansion of the companys corrugated packaging operations in Brazil is expected to be about $325 million. Funding for this expansion will be from current cash levels and third party financing. 28 Table of Contents Financing activities Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $379 million in 2010, compared to $405 million in 2009 and $200 million in 2008. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2010 was driven by dividend payments of $160 million, repayment of long term debt of $132 million, repurchases of MWV common stock of $92 million, payments of notes payable and short term borrowings of $2 million and other uses of funds of $1 million, offset in part by proceeds from issuance of long term debt of $2 million and other sources of funds of $6 million. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2009 was driven by repayment of long term debt of $435 million, dividend payments of $157 million, payments of notes payable and short term borrowings of $34 million and other uses of funds of $32 million, offset in part by proceeds from issuance of long term debt of $250 million and other sources of funds of $3 million. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2008 was driven by dividend payments of $159 million, repayment of long term debt of $36 million, payments of notes payable and short term borrowings of $11 million and other uses of funds of $2 million, offset in part by proceeds from issuance of long term debt of $3 million and other sources of funds of $5 million. The company has available a $600 million bank credit facility that expires in October 2012. Borrowings under this agreement can be in unsecured domestic or Eurodollar notes and at rates approximating Prime or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) at the companys option. The revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant limiting the percentage of total debt to total capitalization (including deferred income tax liabilities) to 55%, as well as certain other covenants with which the company is in compliance. The revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2010. As part of the monitoring activities surrounding the credit quality of the companys credit facilities, management evaluates credit default activities and bank ratings of our lenders. In addition, management undertakes similar measures and evaluates deposit concentrations to monitor the credit quality of the financial institutions that hold the companys cash and cash equivalents. During 2010, the company repaid prior to scheduled maturity $98 million aggregate principal of its 6.85% notes due April 2012. During 2010, the company repurchased and retired 3.9 million of its common shares for $92 million under existing authorizations by the companys Board of Directors. The companys percentage of total debt to total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) was 38% at December 31, 2010 and 39% at December 31, 2009. On January 24, 2011, the companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. 29 Table of Contents EFFECTS OF INFLATION Prices for energy including natural gas, oil and electricity, as well as for raw materials and freight, increased significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, pre tax input costs of energy, raw materials and freight were $110 million higher than in 2009 on a continuing operations basis. During 2009, pre tax input costs of energy, raw materials and freight were $120 million lower than in 2008 on a continuing operations basis. ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over foreign operations of the company. Due to changes in environmental laws and regulations, the application of such regulations, and changes in environmental control technology, it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes. Taking these uncertainties into account, we estimate that we will incur $22 million and $56 million in environmental capital expenditures in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Approximately $23 million was spent on environmental capital projects in 2010. The company has been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or by various state or local governments that it may be liable under federal environmental laws or under applicable state or local laws with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances at sites previously operated or used by the company. The company is currently named as a potentially responsible party (PRP), or has received third party requests for contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state or local laws with respect to numerous sites. There are other sites which may contain contamination or which may be potential Superfund sites, but for which MeadWestvaco has not received any notice or claim. The potential liability for all these sites will depend upon several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, insurance coverage and contribution by other PRPs. The company regularly evaluates its potential liability at these various sites. At December 31, 2010, MeadWestvaco had recorded liabilities of approximately $21 million for estimated potential cleanup costs based upon its close monitoring of ongoing activities and its past experience with these matters. The company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with these sites may exceed amounts of recorded liabilities by an amount that could range from an insignificant amount to as much as $20 million. This estimate is less certain than the estimate upon which the environmental liabilities were based. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. As with numerous other large industrial companies, the company has been named a defendant in asbestos related personal injury litigation. Typically, these suits also name many other corporate defendants. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, have not been significant. As of December 31, 2010, there were approximately 555 lawsuits. Management believes that the company has substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. The company has valid defenses to these claims and intends to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on its historical experience in asbestos cases and an analysis of the current cases, the company believes that it has adequate amounts accrued for potential settlements and judgments in asbestos related litigation. At December 31, 2010, the company had recorded litigation liabilities of approximately $24 million, a significant portion of which relates to asbestos. Should the volume of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that the company could incur significant costs resolving these cases. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering 30 Table of Contents established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. MeadWestvaco is involved in various other litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the currently expected outcome of any matter, lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The company enters into various contractual obligations throughout the year. Presented below are the contractual obligations of the company as of December 31, 2010, and the time period in which payments under the obligations are due.

Restructuring charges Year ended December 31, 2010 During 2005, the company launched a cost reduction initiative to improve the efficiency of its business model. During 2008, the company commenced a separate series of broad cost reduction actions to reduce corporate and business unit overhead expense and close or restructure certain manufacturing locations. Restructuring charges incurred during 2010 were pursuant to the 2008 program. Restructuring charges incurred during 2009 were pursuant to the 2008 and 2005 programs. Cumulative charges included in the results from continuing operations through December 31, 2010 since the inceptions of the 2005 and 2008 programs were $254 million and $247 million, respectively. Although these charges related to individual segments, such amounts are included in Corporate and Other. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company incurred pre tax charges of $53 million from continuing operations in connection with employee separation costs, asset write downs and other restructuring actions, of which $35 million is included in cost of sales and $18 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

MWV qualified for the alternative fuel mixture credit because it uses an alternative fuel known as black liquor, which is a byproduct of its wood pulping process, to power its paperboard mills. The company recorded income of $375 million, after associated expenses, based on fuel usage at its three U.S. paperboard mills from mid January 2009 through December 31, 2009. The credit expired on December 31, 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our principal accounting policies are described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes the accounting policies discussed below represent those accounting policies requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to reported results. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the companys disclosure. Environmental and legal liabilities: We record accruals for estimated environmental liabilities when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to the probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as availability of insurance coverage and contribution by other potentially responsible parties. Due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments, and changes in governmental regulations and environmental technologies, accruals are subject to substantial uncertainties, and actual costs could be materially greater or less than the estimated amounts. We record accruals for other legal contingencies, which are also subject to numerous uncertainties and variables associated with assumptions and judgments, when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Liabilities recorded for claims are limited to pending cases based on the companys historical experience, consultation with outside counsel and consultation with an actuarial specialist concerning the feasibility of reasonably estimating liabilities associated with claims that may arise in the future. We recognize insurance recoveries when collection is reasonably assured. Restructuring and other charges: We periodically record charges for the reduction of our workforce, the closure of manufacturing facilities and other actions related to business improvement and productivity initiatives. These events require estimates of liabilities for employee separation payments and related benefits, demolition, facility closures and other costs, which could differ from actual costs incurred. Pension and postretirement benefits: Assumptions used in the determination of net pension cost and postretirement benefit expense, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and increases in future compensation and medical costs, are evaluated by the company, reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate. Actual asset returns and compensation and medical costs, which are more favorable than assumptions, can have the effect of lowering expense and cash contributions, and, conversely, actual results, which are less favorable than assumptions, could increase expense and cash contributions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense in such future periods. 34 Table of Contents In 2010, the company recorded pre tax pension income from continuing operations of $78 million, compared to $73 million in 2009 and $98 million in 2008. The company currently estimates pre tax pension income in 2011 to be about $80 million. This estimate assumes a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, and a discount rate of 5.25%. The company determined the discount rate by referencing the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The company believes that using a yield curve approach most accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled. If the expected rate of return on plan assets were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income in 2011 would change by approximately $18 million. Similarly, if the discount rate were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income in 2011 would change by approximately $16 million. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate value of pension fund assets had increased to $3.8 billion from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009, reflecting overall favorable equity and fixed income market performance during 2010. For further details regarding pension fund assets, see Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses in the retirement and postretirement benefit plans subject to amortization are amortized over the average remaining service periods, which are about 10 and 7 years for the bargained and salaried retirement plans respectively, and 5 years for the postretirement benefit plan, and are a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Long lived assets useful lives: Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based on managements estimates of the periods over which the assets will be productively utilized in the revenue generation process or for other useful purposes. Factors that affect the determination of lives include prior experience with similar assets, product life expectations and industry practices. The determination of useful lives dictates the period over which tangible and intangible long lived assets are depreciated or amortized, typically using the straight line method. Impairment of long lived assets: We review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. For an asset that is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable judgment must be exercised as to determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to use in any value computations. Intangible assets: Business acquisitions often result in recording intangible assets. Intangible assets are recognized at the time of an acquisition, based upon their fair value. Similar to long lived tangible assets, intangible assets with finite lives are subject to periodic impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As with tangible assets, considerable judgment must be exercised. Periodic impairment reviews of intangible assets assigned an indefinite life are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. As with our review of impairment of tangible assets and goodwill, we employ significant assumptions in assessing our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment (primarily Calmar trademarks and trade names). An income approach (the relief from royalty method) is used to determine the fair values of our 35 Table of Contents indefinite lived intangible assets. Although our estimate of fair values of the companys indefinite lived intangible assets under the income approach exceed the respective carrying values, different assumptions regarding projected performance and other factors could result in significant non cash impairment charges in the future. Based on our annual review of our indefinite lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2010, there was no indication of impairment. Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As with tangible and other intangible assets, periodic impairment reviews are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. We review the recorded value of our goodwill annually on October 1 or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. As with our review of impairment of tangible and intangible assets, we employ significant assumptions in assessing goodwill for impairment. These assumptions include relevant considerations of market participant data. An income approach is generally used to determine the fair values of our reporting units. In applying the income approach in assessing goodwill for impairment, changes in assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for a reporting unit. Although our fair value estimates of the companys reporting units under the income approach exceed the respective carrying values, different assumptions regarding projected performance and other factors could result in significant non cash impairment charges in the future. The following assumptions are key to our income approach: Business projections Projections are based on three year forecasts that are developed internally by management and reviewed by the companys Board of Directors. These projections include significant assumptions such as estimates of future revenues, profits, working capital requirements, operating plans, costs of planned restructuring actions and capital expenditures. Assumptions surrounding macro economic data and estimates include industry projections, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and costs of energy, raw materials and freight. Growth rates A growth rate based on market participant data considerations is used to calculate the terminal value of a reporting unit. The growth rate is the expected rate at which a reporting units earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the three year forecast period. Discount rates Future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant. The weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. The discount rates selected for the reporting units are based on existing conditions within the respective markets and reflect appropriate adjustments for potential risk premiums in those markets as well as appropriate weighting of the market cost of equity versus debt, which is developed with the assistance of external financial advisors. Tax rates Tax rates are based on estimates of the tax rates that a market participant would realize in the respective primary markets and geographic areas in which the reporting units operate. Based on our annual review of the recorded value of goodwill at October 1, 2010, there was no indication of impairment. Holding other valuation assumptions constant, it would take a downward shift in operating profits, which management does not believe is likely, of more than approximately 30% from projected levels before the fair values of any reporting units would be below the respective carrying values, thereby triggering the requirement to perform further analysis which may indicate potential goodwill impairment. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. 36 Table of Contents Revenue recognition: We recognize revenue at the point when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through product sales, and shipping terms generally indicate when title and the risk of ownership have passed. Revenue is recognized at shipment for sales when shipping terms are FOB (free on board) shipping point unless risk of loss is maintained under freight terms. For sales where shipping terms are FOB destination, revenue is recognized when the goods are received by the customer. We provide for all allowances for estimated returns and other customer credits such as discounts and volume rebates, when the revenue is recognized, based on historical experience, current trends and any notification of pending returns. The customer allowances are, in many instances, subjective and are determined with significant management judgment and are reviewed regularly to determine the adequacy of the amounts. Changes in economic conditions, markets and customer relationships may require adjustments to these allowances from period to period. Also included in net sales is service revenue which is recognized as the service is performed. Revenue is recognized for leased equipment to customers on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the lease and is included in net sales of the company. Sales of landholdings are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the strategic view and structure of the operations of the Community Development and Land Management segment established in 2008. Income taxes: Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws. We evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment, including the forecast of future taxable income and the valuation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made. The company has tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. In the preparation of the companys financial statements, management exercises judgments in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters. The company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable. For those tax positions that meet the more likely than not criteria, the company records only the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the respective taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. While actual results could vary, in managements judgment, the company has adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters. Each quarter, management must estimate our effective tax rate for the full year. This estimate includes assumptions about the level of income that will be achieved for the full year in both our domestic and international operations. The forecast of full year earnings includes assumptions about markets in each of our businesses as well as the timing of certain transactions, including forestland sales gains and restructuring charges. Should business performance or the timing of certain transactions change during the year, the level of income achieved may not meet the level of income estimated earlier in the year at interim periods. This change in the income levels and mix of earnings can result in significant adjustments to the tax provision in the quarter in which the estimate is refined. 37 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE During 2010, the company adopted the below accounting guidance as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Accounting for variable interest entities On January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance related to the accounting and disclosure for variable interest entities. The new guidance provides an improved framework for identifying whether an enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity and requires additional disclosures of an enterprises involvement with variable interest entities. The adoption did not have an effect on the companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010. Fair value disclosures On January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures regarding different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, valuation techniques employed and transfers between the levels of fair value measurements. Refer to Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for disclosures of fair value measurements. There were no other accounting standards issued in 2010 that had or are expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. Forward looking Statements Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such information includes, without limitation, the business outlook, assessment of market conditions, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, future plans, contingencies and contemplated transactions of the company. Such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause or contribute to actual results of company operations, or the performance or achievements of each company, or industry results, to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any such risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere herein, risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied for the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances which affect the ability of MeadWestvaco to realize improvements in operating earnings from the companys ongoing cost reduction initiatives; the ability of MeadWestvaco to close announced and pending transactions, including divestitures; the reorganization of the companys packaging business units; competitive pricing for the companys products; impact from inflation on raw materials, energy and other costs; fluctuations in demand and changes in production capacities; relative growth or decline in the United States and international economies; government policies and regulations, including, but not limited to those affecting the environment, climate change, tax policies and the tobacco industry; the companys continued ability to reach agreement with its unionized employees on collective bargaining agreements; the companys ability to execute its plans to divest or otherwise realize the greater value associated with its land holdings; adverse results in current or future litigation; currency movements; volatility and further deterioration of the capital markets; and other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in other filings made from time to time with the SEC. MeadWestvaco undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures made on related subjects in the companys reports filed with the SEC. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Interest rates The company has developed a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt as part of an overall strategy to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To efficiently manage this mix, the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements. There were no outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2010. The total notional amount of interest rate swap instruments was $250 million at December 31, 2009. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. Foreign currency The company has foreign based operations, primarily in South America, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia, which accounted for approximately 32% of its 2010 net sales. In addition, certain of the companys domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of its foreign operations, the company also makes inter company sales and receives royalties and dividends denominated in many different currencies. All of this exposes the company to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of the companys domestic operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in the companys financial statements. The companys foreign currency management policy permits it to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold, which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations. During 2010 and 2009, the company entered into foreign currency hedges to partially offset the foreign currency impact of these flows on operating income. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. The company also issues inter company loans to and receives foreign cash deposits from its foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, exposing it to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates for the inter company loans and changes in spot exchange rates from deposit date for foreign cash deposits. Generally, management uses foreign exchange hedge contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge these exposures. When applied to the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments at December 31, 2010, a 10% adverse change in currency rates would have about a $61 million effect on the companys results. Although the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose it to market risk, fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures. Natural gas In order to better predict and control the future cost of natural gas consumed at the companys mills and plants, the company engages in financial hedging of future gas purchase prices. Gas usage is relatively predictable month by month. The company hedges primarily with financial instruments that are priced based on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas futures contracts. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. 39 Table of Contents
