Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations OVERVIEW For the year ended December 31, 2011, MeadWestvaco Corporation (MeadWestvaco, MWV, or the company) reported net income attributable to the company from continuing operations of $258 million, or $1.49 per share. These results include after tax charges associated with the forthcoming spin off of the Consumer & Office Products business of $47 million, or $0.27 per share, and after tax restructuring charges of $20 million, or $0.11 per share. Comparable results for prior years are noted later in this discussion. Sales from continuing operations increased 6% to $6.06 billion in 2011 compared to $5.69 billion in 2010. In 2011, the company benefited from its profitable growth strategies centered on commercial excellence, insights driven innovation, growth in emerging markets, and expanded participation with new materials and capabilities. Increased sales in 2011 were driven by execution of these profitable growth strategies resulting in improved performance in global markets for food, beverage and tobacco packaging compared to 2010. Sales in 2011 also benefited from higher sales of performance chemicals for inks, adhesives and oilfield drilling markets compared to 2010. Growing participation in emerging markets, such as China and Brazil, continues to produce favorable results with related sales increasing 10% in 2011. Revenues from emerging markets now comprise about 28% of the companys total sales. Pre tax earnings on a continuing operations basis from the companys segments increased 15% to $838 million in 2011 compared to $731 million in 2010. The improved year over year performance reflects the execution of profitable growth strategies to achieve share gains in targeted markets and drive value based pricing to offset rising input cost inflation. MWVs profitable growth strategies delivered favorable performance in 2011 even as volumes in various markets weakened due to the ongoing uncertain global macroeconomic climate. The company also benefitted from a more efficient cost structure, and continues to generate gains in productivity from its improved manufacturing footprint and ongoing operational excellence initiatives. The company continues to execute well on its profitable growth strategies focused on commercial excellence, innovation, emerging markets and expanded participation with new materials and capabilities. Near term, the company remains cautious about weaker demand trends due to ongoing macroeconomic developments, particularly in Europe. The company also continues to experience significant inflation in certain raw materials. As a result, performance in the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be lower compared to year ago levels. However, the company remains confident and is focused on executing its profitable growth strategies to achieve its three to five year targets of 5%+ annual sales growth and 7% to 10% annual earnings growth. On November 17, 2011, the company announced the spin off of its Consumer & Office Products business and signed a definitive agreement to merge the business in a tax efficient transaction into a subsidiary of ACCO Brands Corporation (ACCO). The transaction remains subject to approval by ACCOs shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, MeadWestvaco shareholders will receive 50.5% of the shares of ACCO stock and the company will receive $460 million of cash, subject to certain potential post closing adjustments. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2012. The Consumer & Office Products segment will be presented as a discontinued operation in the companys consolidated statements in the period this transaction closes. 15 Table of Contents On December 30, 2011, the company acquired Polytop Corporation, an innovative leader in the design and manufacturing of dispensing closures serving the food, home and garden, and beauty and personal care packaging markets. The company will extend Polytops market leading dispensing closure solutions across its global packaging platform. The results of operations from the date of this acquisition are included in the Consumer Solutions segment.

In 2011, the company benefited from its profitable growth strategies centered on commercial excellence, insights driven innovation, growth in emerging markets, and expanded participation with new materials and capabilities. Increased sales in 2011 were driven by execution of these profitable growth strategies resulting in improved performance in global markets for food, beverage and tobacco packaging compared to 2010. Sales in 2011 also benefited from higher sales of performance chemicals for inks, adhesives and oilfield drilling markets compared to 2010. Growing participation in emerging markets, such as China and Brazil, continues to produce favorable results with related sales increasing 10% in 2011. Revenues from emerging markets now comprise about 28% of the companys total sales. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information. Costs of sales were $4.68 billion and $4.47 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, increased costs due to higher input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight as well as the impact from foreign currency exchange more than offset the benefits from productivity improvements and overhead cost reductions compared to 2010. In 2011, input costs for energy, raw materials and freight included in cost of sales were $179 million higher compared to 2010. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $12 million and $35 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $818 million and $729 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, benefits from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions were more than offset by costs associated with the forthcoming spin off of the Consumer & Office Products business and investments in new product development and commercial capabilities, as well as modestly higher inflation compared to 2010. Restructuring charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $18 million in both 2011 and 2010. Pension income was $77 million and $78 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Pension income is included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Pension income is expected to be approximately $60 million in 2012. Interest expense was $181 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and was comprised of $149 million related to bond and bank debt, $2 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $21 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $9 million related to other borrowings. Interest expense was $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and was comprised of $154 million related to bond and bank debt, $2 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $20 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $10 million related to other borrowings. 17 Table of Contents Other income, net was $39 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Interest income $ 30 $ 22 Charges from early extinguishments of debt (6 ) Equity investment gain1 10 Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) 2 (4 ) Gains on sales of certain assets 2 Other, net (5 ) 2 $ 39 $ 14 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2011, the company recorded a net pre tax gain of $10 million pursuant to the sale of commercial real estate consummated through an equity investment held by the Community Development and Land Management segment. The companys effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 38% and 17% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher effective tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the mix and levels of pre tax earnings between the companys domestic and foreign operations, the tax impact in 2011 associated with the forthcoming spin off of the Consumer & Office Products business, and the effects from certain items in 2010 including tax benefits from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Credit and tax benefits from an internal reorganization of a domestic entity. Discontinued operations presented in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 primarily relate to the companys sale of its envelope products business on February 1, 2011 and the sale of its media and entertainment packaging business on September 30, 2010. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of the companys segments and certain items included in Corporate and Other. MWVs segments are (i) Packaging Resources, (ii) Consumer Solutions, (iii) Consumer & Office Products, (iv) Specialty Chemicals, and (v) Community Development and Land Management. Refer to Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a reconciliation of the sum of the results of the segments and Corporate and Other to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes. Restructuring charges are included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Refer to the discussion included in Significant Transactions herein below for restructuring charges attributable to the companys segments. 18 Table of Contents Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Sales $ 2,868 $ 2,670 Segment profit 1 320 257 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Packaging Resources segment produces paperboard used in packaging for food, beverage, tobacco, healthcare, and beauty and personal care markets. This segments products include bleached paperboard (SBS) and Coated Natural Kraft&reg; paperboard (CNK&reg;) that are manufactured at three mills located in the U.S. and corrugated packaging that is manufactured at two mills located in Brazil. SBS is principally used in packaging solutions for higher value branded consumer products in global food, tobacco, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals markets. SBS is also used in liquid packaging applications for shelf stable dairy products and other liquid food and beverage products. CNK&reg; is used for a range of packaging applications, the largest of which for MWV are multi pack beverage packaging and food packaging. MWVs corrugated packaging business is focused on fresh produce, frozen meat and consumer products markets in South America. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment were $2.87 billion in 2011 compared to $2.67 billion in 2010. Sales increased in 2011 due to improved pricing and product mix, particularly from products for global food, beverage and tobacco markets, as well as from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2010. In 2011, revenue from emerging markets increased 12% driven by sales of higher value corrugated packaging in Brazil and by volume growth in food, beverage and liquid packaging applications in Asia compared to 2010. Sales generated by MWV Rigesa were 8% higher in 2011 due to improved pricing and product mix reflecting the value of its corrugated packaging offerings in South America, as well as from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2010. In 2011, total paperboard shipments decreased modestly compared to 2010; however, the segment continued to outperform in targeted global food and beverage markets, as volumes in those markets outpaced industry trends and helped offset weaker volumes in general packaging compared to 2010. Backlogs for SBS and CNK&reg; are currently at three weeks. In 2011, MWV Rigesas shipments moderated in line with the Brazilian economy, but remained at solid levels. Profit for the Packaging Resources segment was $320 million in 2011 compared to $257 million in 2010. Profit in 2011 benefited by $173 million from improved pricing and product mix, $27 million from productivity initiatives driving reductions in both input and fixed costs and $12 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2010. Profit in 2011 was negatively impacted by $102 million from inflation, primarily higher input costs for certain raw materials and freight, $44 million from market and maintenance related downtime and $3 million from lower volumes compared to 2010. 19 Table of Contents Consumer Solutions Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Sales $ 1,869 $ 1,818 Segment profit 1 106 125 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Consumer Solutions segment designs and produces packaging solutions and systems for the food, beverage, tobacco, beauty and personal care, healthcare, and home and garden markets. This segment manufactures multi pack cartons primarily for the global beverage take home market, high end packaging for the global tobacco market, injection molded plastic and paperboard packaging for prescription drugs, and dispensing and sprayer systems for personal care, fragrance, healthcare, food, home cleaning, and garden and lawn maintenance products. Paperboard and plastic are converted into packaging products at plants located in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. This segment also has pharmaceutical packaging contracts with retailers, including mass merchants. In addition, this segment manufactures equipment that is leased or sold to its beverage and dairy customers to package their products. Sales for the Consumer Solutions segment were $1.87 billion in 2011 compared to $1.82 billion in 2010. Sales increased in 2011 as improved pricing and product mix across key beverage and tobacco packaging markets and the impact of the 2010 acquisition of Spray Plast within the home and garden market more than offset overall volume declines and unfavorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2010. Inventory management actions by customers and global macroeconomic conditions negatively impacted overall volumes in the home and garden, beauty and personal care and beverage packaging markets in North America and Europe. Sales continue to benefit from solid volume growth in emerging markets, particularly in beverage packaging. Profit for the Consumer Solutions segment was $106 million in 2011 compared to $125 million in 2010. Profit in 2011 benefited by $27 million from improved pricing and product mix and $24 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions compared to 2010. Profit in 2011 was negatively impacted by $54 million from inflation, primarily higher input costs for certain raw materials and freight, $10 million from lower volume and $6 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2010. Consumer & Office Products Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Sales $ 744 $ 748 Segment profit 1 146 141 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Consumer & Office Products segment manufactures, sources, markets and distributes school and office products and time management products in North America and Brazil through both retail and commercial channels. MWV produces many of the leading brand names in school supplies, time management and commercial office products, including AMCAL&reg;, AT A GLANCE&reg;, Cambridge&reg;, Day Runner&reg;, Five Star&reg;, Mead&reg; and Trapper Keeper&reg;. 20 Table of Contents Sales for the Consumer & Office Products segment were $744 million in 2011 compared to $748 million in 2010. In 2011, benefits from improvements in product mix and favorable foreign currency exchange were more than offset by lower overall volumes compared to 2010. In 2011, the North American back to school season finished in line with expectations, but slightly lower than 2010. Sales for planning products were slightly lower in 2011 reflecting lower volume due to the general decline in the category partially offset by improved pricing and product mix compared to 2010. In 2011, sales at Tilibra, the segments Brazilian operation, increased compared to 2010 as product mix improvements and favorable foreign currency exchange more than offset modest volume declines as a result of the general economic slowdown in Brazil, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2011. The segment continues to be impacted by imports from Asia. Profit for the Consumer & Office Products segment was $146 million in 2011 compared to $141 million in 2010. Profit in 2011 benefited by $22 million from improved pricing and product mix, $13 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions and $6 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2010. Profit in 2011 was negatively impacted by $24 million from inflation, primarily higher input costs for certain raw materials and freight, and $12 million from lower volume compared to 2010. Specialty Chemicals Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Sales $ 811 $ 680 Segment profit 1 203 141 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures, markets and distributes specialty chemicals derived from sawdust and other byproducts of the papermaking process in North America, Europe, South America and Asia. Products include activated carbon used in gas vapor emission control systems for automobiles and trucks and applications for air, water and food purification. Other products include performance chemicals used in printing inks, asphalt paving and adhesives, as well as in the agricultural, paper and petroleum industries. Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment were $811 million in 2011 compared to $680 million in 2010. In 2011, pricing and product mix improvement across key pine chemicals markets, as well as a modest increase in overall volume, drove sales growth compared to 2010. Sales in 2011 benefited from the segments continued success in penetrating higher value markets for pine chemicals, asphalt additives and carbon technologies. The segment also continues to benefit from its focus on the highest value formulations used in the manufacturing of publication inks, adhesives, oilfield drilling and road building and maintenance solutions. In carbon solutions, sales were up in 2011 due to volume gains in water purification and improved pricing and product mix compared to 2010. Automotive carbon volumes in 2011 were relatively unchanged compared to 2010 as auto production levels in North America were up year over year, although offset from lower production in Japan due to the tsunami. Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment was $203 million in 2011 compared to $141 million in 2010. Profit in 2011 benefited by $105 million from improved pricing and product mix, $11 million from 21 Table of Contents productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions and $5 million from increased volume compared to 2010. Profit in 2011 was negatively impacted by $43 million from inflation, primarily higher input costs for certain raw materials and freight, and $16 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2010. Community Development and Land Management Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Sales $ 161 $ 168 Segment profit 1 63 67 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. The Community Development and Land Management segment is responsible for maximizing the value of the companys landholdings in the Southeastern region of the U.S. Operations of the segment include real estate development, forestry operations and leasing activities. Real estate development includes (i) selling non core forestlands primarily for recreational and residential uses, (ii) entitling and improving high value tracts, and (iii) master planning select landholdings. Forestry operations include growing and harvesting softwood and hardwood on the companys forestlands for external consumption and for use by the companys mill based business. Leasing activities include fees from third parties undertaking mineral extraction operations, as well as fees from recreational leases on the companys forestlands. Sales for the Community Development and Land Management segment were $161 million in 2011 compared to $168 million in 2010. Profit was $63 million in 2011 compared to $67 million in 2010. Profit from real estate activities was $54 million in 2011 versus $55 million in 2010. In 2011, the company sold approximately 30,090 acres for gross proceeds of $73 million versus approximately 25,130 acres for gross proceeds of $80 million in 2010. Profit from forestry operations and leasing activities was $9 million in 2011 compared to $12 million in 2010. The real estate sector remains challenging due to high unemployment and weak consumer spending. These factors will likely continue to influence near term results. During this time the segment will continue to move forward with its near and long term real estate value creation plans, including enhancing rural land, and entitling and master planning its highest potential development properties. Corporate and Other Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Corporate and Other expense, net $ (420 ) $ (415 ) Corporate and Other includes expenses associated with corporate support staff services, as well as income and expense items not directly associated with ongoing segment operations, such as restructuring charges, pension income and curtailment gains and losses, interest expense and income, non controlling interest income and losses, certain legal settlements, gains and losses on certain asset sales and other items. Corporate and Other expense, net was $420 million and $415 million for the years December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, the expense, net of certain income items, includes interest expense of 22 Table of Contents $181 million, interest income of $30 million, pension income of $77 million and restructuring charges of $30 million. In 2010, the expense, net of certain income items, includes interest expense of $186 million, interest income of $22 million, pension income of $78 million and restructuring charges of $53 million. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Sales from continuing operations were $5.69 billion and $5.41 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Increased sales were driven by higher volumes and improved pricing and product mix resulting from strong commercial execution in MWVs targeted global markets, as well as from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. These positive effects on sales in 2010 were partially offset by negative volume impacts stemming from continued strategic exits from low return products. Participation in emerging markets, including Asia and Brazil, produced favorable results with related sales increasing 15% in 2010. Revenues from emerging markets comprised approximately 27% of the companys total sales. Refer to the individual segment discussion that follows for detailed sales information. Costs of sales were $4.47 billion and $4.45 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, increased costs due to higher volumes and input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight more than offset the benefits from productivity improvements and overhead cost reductions compared to 2009. In 2010, input costs for energy, raw materials and freight included in cost of sales were $110 million higher compared to 2009. Restructuring charges included in cost of sales were $35 million and $137 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $729 million and $755 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Benefits in 2010 from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions more than offset increased costs associated with investments for new product development and to accelerate profitable growth in emerging markets, as well as increased costs of implementing information technology systems and related processes for certain European operations compared to 2009. Restructuring charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $18 million and $36 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Pension income from continuing operations was $78 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Pension income is included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. Interest expense was $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and was comprised of $154 million related to bond and bank debt, $2 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $20 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $10 million related to other borrowings. Interest expense was $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and was comprised of $157 million related to bond and bank debt, $4 million related to a long term obligation non recourse to MWV, $20 million related to borrowings under life insurance policies and $14 million related to other borrowings. 23 Table of Contents Other income, net was $14 million and $382 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and was comprised of the following: Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Interest income $ 22 $ 18 Charges from early extinguishments of debt (6 ) (23 ) Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) (4 ) 2 Gains on sales of certain assets 16 Alternative fuel mixture credit1 375 Other, net 2 (6 ) $ 14 $ 382 (1) Through December 31, 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allowed an excise tax credit for alternative fuel mixtures produced by a taxpayer for use as a fuel in a taxpayers trade or business. The companys effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 17% and 39% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to the mix and levels of pre tax earnings between the companys domestic and foreign operations, the effects from certain items in 2010 including tax benefits from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Credit (CBPC) and tax benefits from an internal reorganization of a domestic entity, and the favorable impact of $375 million to pre tax domestic income in 2009 from alternative fuel mixture credits (AFMC). In 2010, the company recorded a $20 million tax benefit net of taxes and related reserves related to the CBPC. The tax benefit recognized in 2010 was related to cellulose biofuel produced in 2009 for which the company had not previously made claims under AFMC. The availability of the CBPC for cellulose biofuel produced by the companys pulp and paper mills expired on December 31, 2009. Taxpayers may be able to obtain benefits from the CBPC by repaying all or part of the AFMC previously received. At this time, management does not anticipate repaying the AFMC previously claimed in order to obtain the CBPC. Discontinued operations presented in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 primarily relate to the companys sale of its envelope products business on February 1, 2011 and the sale of its media and entertainment packaging business on September 30, 2010. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. In addition to the information discussed above, the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of the companys segments and certain items included in Corporate and Other. Packaging Resources Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ 2,670 $ 2,446 Segment profit 1 257 182 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. Sales for the Packaging Resources segment were $2.67 billion in 2010 compared to $2.45 billion in 2009. Sales increased in 2010 due to higher volume and improved pricing and product mix, as well as from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. Sales by the segments Brazilian operation, MWV Rigesa, were 24% higher in 2010 due to favorable foreign currency exchange and improved pricing and product mix, as well as from increased volume compared to 2009. 24 Table of Contents Profit for the Packaging Resources segment was $257 million in 2010 compared to $182 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $122 million from improved pricing and product mix, $64 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions and $18 million from increased volume compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $97 million from input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight, $25 million from increased costs due to reduced fiber availability from severe weather in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2010 and $7 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2009. Consumer Solutions Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ 1,818 $ 1,847 Segment profit 1 125 94 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. Sales for the Consumer Solutions segment were $1.82 billion in 2010 compared to $1.85 billion in 2009. Sales declined in 2010 due to the impact stemming from deliberate exits from low return products, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. The effects of these items in 2010 were partially offset by growth in emerging markets, as well as from improved overall pricing and product mix compared to 2009. Profit for the Consumer Solutions segment was $125 million in 2010 compared to $94 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $55 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions, $8 million from improved pricing and product mix, $1 million from increased volume and $10 million from foreign currency exchange and other items, including the impact from strategic actions to eliminate low return products, compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $43 million from input cost inflation for certain raw materials and freight compared to 2009. Consumer & Office Products Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ 748 $ 749 Segment profit 1 141 137 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. Sales for the Consumer & Office Products segment were $748 million in 2010 compared to $749 million in 2009. In 2010, the segment had a solid back to school season in North America lead by its Mead&reg; and FiveStar&reg; line up despite modestly lower sales as increased school volumes were more than offset by an unfavorable mix of products compared to 2009. Sales for dated and time management products in 2010 were also lower than 2009 due to the segments continued strategy of exiting low return product lines. In 2010, sales in Brazil declined compared to 2009 as a shift in timing of the back to school season in Brazil moved some volume into 2011. Sales in 2010 benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange compared to 2009. 25 Table of Contents Profit for the Consumer & Office Products segment was $141 million in 2010 compared to $137 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $34 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $14 million from unfavorable product mix, $11 million from input cost inflation primarily for certain raw materials and freight and $5 million from lower volume compared to 2009. Specialty Chemicals Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ 680 $ 503 Segment profit 1 141 56 (1) Segment profit is measured as results before restructuring charges, pension income, interest expense and income, income taxes, and non controlling interest income and losses. Sales for the Specialty Chemicals segment were $680 million in 2010 compared to $503 million in 2009. Sales increased in 2010 from significantly higher volumes and improved pricing and product mix due to strong demand for pine chemicals and activated carbon, as well as strong demand for the segments asphalt solutions in emerging markets. Sales in 2010 also benefited from increased sales of chemicals for oil field services, adhesives, printing inks and water and food purification applications, as well as from increased automotive production in North America, Europe and emerging markets compared to 2009. Profit for the Specialty Chemicals segment was $141 million in 2010 compared to $56 million in 2009. Profit in 2010 benefited by $41 million from improved pricing and product mix, $25 million from increased volume, $11 million from productivity initiatives and overhead reduction actions and $9 million from input cost deflation compared to 2009. Profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by $1 million from foreign currency exchange and other items compared to 2009.

Sales for the Community Development and Land Management segment were $168 million in 2010 compared to $193 million in 2009. Profit was $67 million in 2010 compared to $99 million in 2009. Profit from real estate activities was $55 million in 2010 versus $88 million in 2009. In 2010, the company sold approximately 25,130 acres for gross proceeds of $80 million versus approximately 59,700 acres for gross proceeds of $118 million in 2009. Profit from forestry operations and leasing activities was $12 million in 2010 compared to $11 million in 2009. 26 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Sales $ $ 49 Corporate and Other expense, net (415 ) (176 ) Corporate and Other expense, net was $415 million and $176 million for the years December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, the expense, net of certain income items, includes interest expense of $186 million, interest income of $22 million, pension income of $78 million and restructuring charges of $53 million. In 2009, the expense, net of certain income items, includes alternative fuel credits of $375 million, interest expense of $195 million, interest income of $18 million, pension income of $73 million and restructuring charges of $173 million. Revenue included in Corporate and Other in 2009 includes sales from the companys specialty papers operation, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2009. 27 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flow from continuing operations and the companys current cash levels are expected to be adequate to fund scheduled debt payments, dividends to shareholders and a major portion of MWVs capital expenditures in 2012. In addition, the companys U.S. qualified retirement plans remain well over funded and management does not anticipate any required regulatory funding contributions to such plans in the foreseeable future. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $656 million at December 31, 2011, of which approximately half was held in the U.S. with the remaining portions of 22% in Europe, 20% in Brazil and 9% in other foreign jurisdictions. The credit quality of the companys portfolio of short term investments remains strong with the majority of its cash equivalents invested in U.S. government securities. Of the companys cash and cash equivalents held in Europe, approximately 85% are invested in U.S. government securities. Funding for the companys domestic operating, investing and financing activities in the foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within its U.S. operations, including cash holdings, operating cash flow and bank committed credit capacity. As such, the companys offshore cash holdings are not a key source of liquidity to its U.S. operations and management does not intend to transfer cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. that would be subject to potential tax impacts associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings on foreign subsidiaries. On January 30, 2012, the company entered into a new $600 million five year revolving credit facility and a new $250 million five year term loan facility which in total provides $850 million of bank committed credit capacity. Management continuously monitors the credit quality of the companys credit facility banks, insurance providers and derivative contract counter parties, in addition to customers and key suppliers. Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $565 million in 2011, compared to $551 million in 2010 and $831 million in 2009. The increase in cash flow in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to higher earnings. The decrease in cash flow in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects higher receipts of alternative fuel mixture credits of $292 million in 2009 compared to 2010, partially offset by improved year over year segment earnings in 2010. Cash used by operating activities from discontinued operations was $5 million in both 2011 and 2010, compared to cash provided by discontinued operations of $45 million in 2009. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $689 million in 2011, compared to $279 million in 2010 and $211 million in 2009. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2011 was driven by capital expenditures of $670 million, payments for acquired businesses (net of cash acquired) of $70 million, contributions to joint ventures of $8 million, offset in part by proceeds from dispositions of assets of $59 million. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2010 was driven by capital expenditures of $242 million, payments for acquired businesses (net of cash acquired) of $49 million, contributions to joint ventures of $9 million and other uses of funds of $10 million, offset in part by proceeds from dispositions of assets of $31 million. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2009 was driven by capital expenditures of $218 million, payments for acquired businesses (net of cash acquired) of $15 million, contributions to joint ventures of $5 million and other uses of funds of $25 million, offset in part by proceeds from dispositions of assets of $52 million. Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was $46 million in 2011, 28 Table of Contents compared to $59 million in 2010 and $2 million in 2009. Cash flows provided by discontinued operations in 2011 and 2010 primarily relate to proceeds received from dispositions of certain businesses. In 2011, capital spending associated with the expansion of MWVs corrugated packaging business in Brazil was $286 million and capital spending associated with the construction of a new biomass boiler at the Covington paperboard mill was $51 million. Total capital spending in 2012 is expected to range from $660 million to $685 million and will be comprised of expenditures for major investments as well as for ongoing productivity improvements and maintenance capital and environmental compliance. Capital spending associated with the expansion of MWVs corrugated packaging business in Brazil is expected to be about $175 million. Capital spending associated with the construction of a new biomass boiler at the Covington paperboard mill is expected to be about $185 million. In addition to the expenditures associated with these major investments, capital spending in 2012 related to productivity initiatives, as well as maintenance capital and environmental compliance is expected to range from $300 million to $325 million. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $26 million in 2011, compared to $379 million in 2010 and $405 million in 2009. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2011 was driven by dividend payments of $170 million and repayment of long term debt of $42 million, offset in part by proceeds from issuance of long term debt of $113 million, proceeds from the exercises of stock options of $38 million, proceeds from notes payable and other short term borrowings of $31 million and other sources of funds of $4 million. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2010 was driven by dividend payments of $160 million, repayment of long term debt of $132 million, repurchases of MWV common stock of $92 million, payments of notes payable and short term borrowings of $2 million and other uses of funds of $1 million, offset in part by proceeds from other sources of funds of $8 million. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2009 was driven by repayment of long term debt of $435 million, dividend payments of $157 million, payments of notes payable and short term borrowings of $34 million and other uses of funds of $32 million, offset in part by proceeds from issuance of long term debt of $250 million and other sources of funds of $3 million. During 2011, MeadWestvaco entered into a R$470 million bank credit agreement with the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) in connection with the companys expansion in Brazil. Amounts borrowed under this facility will fund qualifying equipment purchases in accordance with the BNDES agreement and will incur a fixed rate of interest of 5.5%. Borrowings under this facility will be denominated in Brazilian Real currency. Principal payments will commence in 2013 with final maturity in 2020. Approximately R$180 million (U.S. Dollar equivalent of approximately $97 million) was drawn under this facility at December 31, 2011. Total remaining capacity of this facility in Brazilian Real currency was R$290 million at December 31, 2011 (U.S. Dollar equivalent of approximately $155 million). MeadWestvaco had a $600 million bank credit agreement which was undrawn at December 31, 2011. The $600 million credit agreement contained a financial covenant limiting the percentage of total debt to total capitalization (including deferred taxes) to 55%, as well as certain other covenants with which the company was in compliance at December 31, 2011. On January 30, 2012, MeadWestvaco entered into a new $600 million five year revolving credit facility and a new $250 million five year term loan facility (collectively the New Credit Facilities) with a syndicate of banks. The New Credit Facilities are scheduled to expire on January 30, 2017 and replaced the aforementioned $600 million bank credit agreement that was due to expire on October 19, 2012. The 29 Table of Contents New Credit Facilities will be used for general corporate purposes. The New Credit Facilities agreement contains a financial covenant limiting the percentage of total debt to total capitalization (including deferred taxes) to 55%, as well as certain other covenants with which the company is in compliance. A bond debenture with a remaining balance totaling approximately $221 million is scheduled to mature in April 2012 and will be paid from sources of liquidity within the companys U.S. operations. As part of the monitoring activities surrounding the credit quality of the companys credit facilities, management evaluates credit default activities and bank ratings of our lenders. In addition, management undertakes similar measures and evaluates deposit concentrations to monitor the credit quality of the financial institutions that hold the companys cash and cash equivalents. The companys percentage of total debt to total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) was 40% and 38% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. On January 23, 2012, the companys Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share. EFFECTS OF INFLATION Prices for energy, including natural gas, oil and electricity, as well as for raw materials and freight, increased in 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, pre tax input costs of energy, raw materials and freight were $179 million higher than in 2010 on a continuing operations basis. During 2010, pre tax input costs of energy, raw materials and freight were $110 million higher than in 2009 on a continuing operations basis. ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, as well as regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over foreign operations of the company. Due to changes in environmental laws and regulations, the application of such regulations, and changes in environmental control technology, it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the amount of capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental purposes. Taking these uncertainties into account, we estimate that we will incur $48 million and $66 million in environmental capital expenditures in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Approximately $52 million was spent on environmental capital projects in 2011. The company has been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or by various state or local governments that it may be liable under federal environmental laws or under applicable state or local laws with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances at sites previously operated or used by the company. The company is currently named as a potentially responsible party (PRP), or has received third party requests for contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar state or local laws with respect to numerous sites. There are other sites which may contain contamination or which may be potential Superfund sites, but for which MeadWestvaco has not received any notice or claim. The potential liability for all these sites will depend upon several factors, including the extent of contamination, the method of remediation, insurance coverage and contribution by other PRPs. The company regularly evaluates its potential liability at these various sites. At December 31, 2011, MeadWestvaco had recorded liabilities of approximately $24 million for estimated potential cleanup costs based upon its close monitoring of ongoing activities and its past experience with these matters. The company believes that it is reasonably possible that costs associated with these sites may exceed amounts of recorded liabilities by an amount that could range from an insignificant amount to as much as $20 million. This estimate is less certain than the estimate upon which the environmental liabilities were based. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering 30 Table of Contents established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. As with numerous other large industrial companies, the company has been named a defendant in asbestos related personal injury litigation. Typically, these suits also name many other corporate defendants. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, have not been significant. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 510 lawsuits. Management believes that the company has substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, with respect to asbestos claims. The company has valid defenses to these claims and intends to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on its historical experience in asbestos cases and an analysis of the current cases, the company believes that it has adequate amounts accrued for potential settlements and judgments in asbestos related litigation. At December 31, 2011, the company had recorded litigation liabilities of approximately $34 million, a significant portion of which relates to asbestos. Should the volume of litigation grow substantially, it is possible that the company could incur significant costs resolving these cases. After consulting with legal counsel and after considering established liabilities, it is our judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. MeadWestvaco is involved in various other litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the currently expected outcome of any matter, lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. 31 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The company enters into various contractual obligations throughout the year.

The transaction remains subject to approval by ACCOs shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. At closing, MeadWestvaco shareholders will receive 50.5% of the shares of ACCO stock and the company will receive $460 million of cash, subject to certain potential post closing adjustments. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2012. The Consumer & Office Products segment will be presented as a discontinued operation in the companys consolidated statements in the period this transaction closes. Dispositions On February 1, 2011, the company completed the sale of its envelope products business for cash proceeds of $55 million. During 2010, the company recorded pre tax charges of $19 million ($15 million after taxes) comprised of impairment of long lived assets of $6 million, impairment of allocated goodwill of $7 million and a pension curtailment loss of $6 million. During 2011, the company recorded additional charges of $1 million ($0.7 million after taxes) primarily related to a working capital adjustment. The combined pre tax charges recorded in 2010 and 2011 sum to $20 million ($16 million after taxes) and represent the total amount of loss on sale of the envelope products business. The operating results of this business, as well as the charges noted above, are reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations on an after tax basis. The results of operations and assets and liabilities of the envelope products business were previously included in the Consumer & Office Products segment. On September 30, 2010, the company completed the sale of its media and entertainment packaging business for cash proceeds of $68 million. The sale resulted in a pre tax loss of $153 million ($126 million after taxes). During 2011, the company recorded additional charges of $12 million ($8 million after taxes) primarily related to a media and packaging business pension settlement. The combined pre tax charges recorded in 2010 and 2011 sum to $165 million ($134 million after taxes) and represent the total amount of loss on sale of the envelope products business. The operating results of this business, as well as the charges noted above, are reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations on an after tax basis. The results of operations and assets and liabilities of the media and entertainment packaging business were previously included in the Consumer Solutions segment. Refer to Note R of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. Restructuring charges During 2008, the company commenced a series of broad cost reduction actions to lower overhead costs and close or restructure certain manufacturing locations. Restructuring charges incurred during 2011 and 2010 are pursuant to the 2008 program. During 2005, the company launched a cost reduction initiative to improve the efficiency of its business model. Restructuring charges incurred during 2009 were pursuant to the 2008 and 2005 programs. Cumulative charges included in the results from continuing operations through December 31, 2011 since the inceptions of these programs were $254 million for the 2005 program and $277 million for the 2008 program. Although these charges related to individual segments, such amounts are included in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes. 33 Table of Contents Restructuring charges attributable to individual segments and by nature of cost, as well as cost of sales (COS) and selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) classification in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are presented below.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management believes the accounting policies discussed below represent those accounting policies requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to reported results. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the companys disclosure. Environmental and legal liabilities: We record accruals for estimated environmental liabilities when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These estimates reflect assumptions and judgments as to the probable nature, magnitude and timing of required investigation, remediation and monitoring activities, as well as availability of insurance coverage and contribution by other potentially responsible parties. Due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments, and changes in governmental regulations and environmental technologies, accruals are subject to substantial uncertainties, and actual costs could be materially greater or less than the estimated amounts. We record accruals for other legal contingencies, which are also subject to numerous uncertainties and variables associated with assumptions and judgments, when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Liabilities recorded for claims are limited to pending cases based on the companys historical experience, consultation with outside counsel and consultation with an actuarial specialist concerning the feasibility of reasonably estimating liabilities associated with claims that may arise in the future. We recognize insurance recoveries when collection is reasonably assured. Restructuring and other charges: We periodically record charges for the reduction of our workforce, the closure of manufacturing facilities and other actions related to broad cost reduction actions and productivity initiatives. These events require estimates of liabilities for employee separation payments and related benefits, demolition, facility closures and other costs, which could differ from actual costs incurred. Pension and postretirement benefits: Assumptions used in the determination of net pension cost and postretirement benefit expense, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and increases in future compensation and medical costs, are evaluated by the company, reviewed with the plan actuaries annually and updated as appropriate. Actual asset returns and compensation and medical costs, which are more favorable than assumptions, can have the effect of lowering expense and cash contributions, and, conversely, actual results, which are less favorable than assumptions, could increase expense and cash contributions. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense in such future periods. In 2011, the company recorded pre tax pension income from continuing operations of $77 million, compared to $78 million in 2010 and $73 million in 2009. The company currently estimates pre tax pension income in 2012 to be approximately $60 million. This estimate assumes a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, and a discount rate of 4.25%. The company determined the discount rate by referencing the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The company believes that using a yield curve approach most accurately reflects changes in the present value of liabilities over time since each cash flow is discounted at the rate at which it could effectively be settled. 35 Table of Contents If the expected rate of return on plan assets were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income in 2012 would change by approximately $18 million. Similarly, if the discount rate were to change by 0.5%, annual pension income in 2012 would change by approximately $15 million. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate value of pension fund assets had increased to $4.0 billion from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2010, reflecting overall favorable equity and fixed income market performance during 2011. For further details regarding pension fund assets, see Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Prior service cost and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in the retirement and postretirement benefit plans subject to amortization are amortized over the average remaining service periods, which are about 8 years for the bargained and salaried retirement plans, and about 5 years for the postretirement benefit plan, and are a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Prior service cost and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses associated with the envelope products salaried plan are being amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants of about 26 years. The envelope products salaried plan was retained by the company post sale of the envelope products business. Long lived assets useful lives: Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets are based on managements estimates of the periods over which the assets will be productively utilized in the revenue generation process or for other useful purposes. Factors that affect the determination of lives include prior experience with similar assets, product life expectations and industry practices. The determination of useful lives dictates the period over which tangible and intangible long lived assets are depreciated or amortized, typically using the straight line method. Impairment of long lived assets: We review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. For an asset that is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable judgment must be exercised as to determining future cash flows and their timing and, possibly, choosing business value comparables or selecting discount rates to use in any value computations. Intangible assets: Business acquisitions often result in recording intangible assets. Intangible assets are recognized at the time of an acquisition, based upon their fair value. Similar to long lived tangible assets, intangible assets with finite lives are subject to periodic impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As with tangible assets, considerable judgment must be exercised. Periodic impairment reviews of intangible assets assigned an indefinite life are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. As with our review of impairment of tangible assets and goodwill, we employ significant assumptions in assessing our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment (primarily Calmar trademarks and trade names). An income approach (the relief from royalty method) is used to determine the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets. Although our estimate of fair values of the companys indefinite lived intangible assets under the income approach exceed the respective carrying values, different assumptions regarding projected performance and other factors could result in significant non cash impairment charges in the future. Based on our annual review of our indefinite lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2011, there was no indication of impairment. 36 Table of Contents Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As with tangible and other intangible assets, periodic impairment reviews are required, at least annually, as well as when events or circumstances change. We review the recorded value of our goodwill annually on October 1 or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. As with our review of impairment of tangible and intangible assets, we employ significant assumptions in assessing goodwill for impairment. These assumptions include relevant considerations of market participant data. When it is determined that the two step impairment test is required, an income approach is generally used to determine the fair values of our reporting units. In applying the income approach in assessing goodwill for impairment, changes in assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for a reporting unit. Although our fair value estimates of the companys reporting units under the income approach exceed the respective carrying values, different assumptions regarding projected performance and other factors could result in significant non cash impairment charges in the future. The following assumptions are key to our income approach: Business projections Projections are based on three year forecasts that are developed internally by management and reviewed by the companys Board of Directors. These projections include significant assumptions such as estimates of future revenues, profits, working capital requirements, operating plans, costs of planned restructuring actions and capital expenditures. Assumptions surrounding macro economic data and estimates include industry projections, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and costs of energy, raw materials and freight. Growth rates A growth rate based on market participant data considerations is used to calculate the terminal value of a reporting unit. The growth rate is the expected rate at which a reporting units earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the three year forecast period. Discount rates Future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant. The weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. The discount rates selected for the reporting units are based on existing conditions within the respective markets and reflect appropriate adjustments for potential risk premiums in those markets as well as appropriate weighting of the market cost of equity versus debt, which is developed with the assistance of external financial advisors. Tax rates Tax rates are based on estimates of the tax rates that a market participant would realize in the respective primary markets and geographic areas in which the reporting units operate. Based on our annual review of the recorded value of goodwill at October 1, 2011, there was no indication of impairment. Holding other valuation assumptions constant, it would take a downward shift in operating profits, which management does not believe is likely, of more than approximately 25% from projected levels before the fair values of any reporting units would be below the respective carrying values, thereby triggering the requirement to perform further analysis which may indicate potential goodwill impairment.

Substantially all of our revenues are generated through product sales, and shipping terms generally indicate when title and the risk of ownership have passed. Revenue is recognized at shipment for sales when shipping terms are FOB (free on board) shipping point unless risk of loss is maintained under freight terms. For sales where shipping terms are FOB destination, revenue is recognized when the goods are received by the customer. We provide for all allowances for estimated returns and other customer credits such as discounts and volume rebates, when the revenue is recognized, based on historical experience, current trends and any notification of pending returns. The customer allowances are, in many instances, subjective and are determined with significant management judgment and are reviewed regularly to determine the adequacy of the amounts. Changes in economic conditions, markets and customer relationships may require adjustments to these allowances from period to period. Also included in net sales is service revenue, which is recognized as the service is performed. Revenue is recognized for leased equipment to customers on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the lease and is included in net sales of the company. Sales of landholdings are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the strategic view and structure of the operations of the Community Development and Land Management segment established in 2008. Income taxes: Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws. We evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment, including the forecast of future taxable income and the valuation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made. The company has tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. In the preparation of the companys financial statements, management exercises judgments in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters. The company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable. For those tax positions that meet the more likely than not criteria, the company records only the portion of the tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the respective taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. While actual results could vary, in managements judgment, the company has adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters. Each quarter, management must estimate our effective tax rate for the full year. This estimate includes assumptions about the level of income that will be achieved for the full year in both our domestic and international operations. The forecast of full year earnings includes assumptions about markets in each of our businesses as well as the timing of certain transactions, including gains from forestland sales and restructuring charges. Should business performance or the timing of certain transactions change during the year, the level of income achieved may not meet the level of income estimated earlier in the year at interim periods. This change in the income levels and mix of earnings can result in significant adjustments to the tax provision in the quarter in which the estimate is refined. 38 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued new accounting guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance requires the presentation of items of net income and comprehensive income in either a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. This accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The impact of adoption will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance regarding the testing of goodwill for impairment. The new guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the required annual goodwill impairment test. This accounting guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. The company adopted the above provisions for its annual goodwill test performed in 2011. The impact of adoption did not have an effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance regarding additional disclosures for financial instruments that are offset including the gross amount of the asset and liability as well as the impact of any net amount presented in the consolidated financial statements. These provisions are effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The impact of adoption will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards issued in 2011 that had or are expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. 39 Table of Contents Forward looking Statements Certain statements in this document and elsewhere by management of the company that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such information includes, without limitation, the business outlook, assessment of market conditions, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, future plans, contingencies and contemplated transactions of the company. Such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause or contribute to actual results of company operations, or the performance or achievements of each company, or industry results, to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. In addition to any such risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed elsewhere herein, risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied for the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances which affect the ability of MeadWestvaco to realize improvements in operating earnings from the companys ongoing cost reduction initiatives; the ability of MeadWestvaco to close announced and pending transactions, including the MWV Consumer & Office Products/ACCO Brands transaction; the reorganization of the companys packaging business units; competitive pricing for the companys products; impact from inflation on raw materials, energy and other costs; fluctuations in demand and changes in production capacities; relative growth or decline in the United States and international economies; government policies and regulations, including, but not limited to those affecting the environment, climate change, tax policies and the tobacco industry; the companys continued ability to reach agreement with its unionized employees on collective bargaining agreements; the companys ability to execute its plans to divest or otherwise realize the greater value associated with its land holdings; adverse results in current or future litigation; currency movements; volatility and further deterioration of the capital markets; and other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in other filings made from time to time with the SEC. MeadWestvaco undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures made on related subjects in the companys reports filed with the SEC. 40 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Interest rates The company has developed a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt as part of an overall strategy to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To efficiently manage this mix, the company may utilize interest rate swap agreements. There were no outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2011 and 2010. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. Foreign currency The company has foreign based operations, primarily in South America, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia, which accounted for approximately 34% of its 2011 net sales. In addition, certain of the companys domestic operations have sales to foreign customers. In the conduct of its foreign operations, the company also makes inter company sales and receives royalties and dividends denominated in many different currencies. All of this exposes the company to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Flows of foreign currencies into and out of the companys operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in the companys financial statements. The companys foreign currency management policy permits it to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold, which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations. During 2011 and 2010, the company entered into foreign currency hedges to partially offset the foreign currency impact of these flows on operating income. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. The company also issues inter company loans to and receives foreign cash deposits from its foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies, exposing it to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates for the inter company loans and changes in spot exchange rates from deposit date for foreign cash deposits. Generally, management uses foreign exchange hedge contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge these exposures. When applied to the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments at December 31, 2011, a 10% adverse change in currency rates would have about a $36 million effect on the companys results. Although the companys derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose it to market risk, fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures. Natural gas In order to better predict and control the future cost of natural gas consumed at the companys mills and plants, the company engages in financial hedging of future gas purchase prices. Gas usage is relatively predictable month by month. The company hedges primarily with financial instruments that are priced based on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas futures contracts. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for related discussion. 41 Table of Contents
