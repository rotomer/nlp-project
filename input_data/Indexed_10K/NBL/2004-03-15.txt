Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Noble Energy is an independent energy company engaged, directly or through its subsidiaries or various arrangements with other companies, in the exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas. The Company has exploration, exploitation and production operations domestically and internationally. The domestic areas consist of: offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and California; the Gulf Coast Region (Louisiana and Texas); the Mid Continent Region (Oklahoma and Kansas); and the Rocky Mountain Region (Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming and California). The international areas of operations include Argentina, China, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea (Israel), the North Sea (Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and Vietnam. The Company also markets domestic crude oil and natural gas production through a wholly owned subsidiary, NEMI. The Companys accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Noble Energys principal business strategy is to create shareholder value by generating stable cash flow and production from domestic operations, while generating growth from international projects. In the U.S., the Company has a substantial onshore and offshore asset base located in established, prolific basins where the Company is aggressively pursuing exploration and exploitation opportunities. Offshore, exploration focuses on the deepwater and deep shelf areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, the Company has built a strong project portfolio and has applied innovative approaches to developing markets for stranded natural gas, including construction of a natural gas fired power plant near Machala, Ecuador, and liquefied petroleum gas and methanol plants in Equatorial Guinea. Over the past two years, the Company has completed major, capital intensive projects in Ecuador, China, Israel and the first phase of a two phase project in Equatorial Guinea. With these important projects completed, international capital commitments are declining rapidly. At the same time, the projects are contributing significantly to the Companys financial and operating results. During 2003, Noble Energy reached several milestones in positioning the Company as a major international competitor among independent exploration and production companies, including: First production in China occurred in January 2003; Initial production began in November 2003 from the Phase 2A expansion project in Equatorial Guinea; Facilities were commissioned to begin production of natural gas in Israel, with first production in December 2003 and first sales in February 2004; and Full year of Ecuador power plant operations. Domestically, an active onshore drilling program led to several discoveries and new production during 2003. Offshore, in the deepwater region of the Gulf of Mexico, the Company announced an apparent discovery on the Lorien prospect and start of production from the Boris field. In the shelf region of the Gulf of Mexico, there was new production from the Roaring Fork field beginning in the fourth quarter. Also during 2003, the Company identified and prepared for sale five packages of domestic non core properties. This divestiture program was intended to reduce costs and streamline the business. At the close of the year, sales were completed on four of the property packages. 2003 was a year of strong financial performance as well: Net income for 2003 was $78.0 million, a significant increase over 2002 net income of $17.7 million; Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was $602.8 million, an increase of $95.8 million over net cash provided by operating activities of $507.0 million in 2002; and The Company ended the year with a stronger balance sheet total debt was $929.7 million, net of unamortized discount, at year end 2003, a reduction of $89.3 million from the previous year. 23 With 2003s strong financial performance and the decline in international capital commitments, Noble Energy gained enhanced financial flexibility. Projects in China, Ecuador and Israel are now complete. In Equatorial Guinea, the first phase production is ramping up and the second phase is scheduled for completion by year end 2004. The completion of these projects should contribute to increased amounts of free cash flow. Domestic operations have implemented disciplined business processes that have stabilized production. As a result, Noble Energy has gained financial and operational flexibility. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. When alternatives exist among various accounting methods, the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts. The following is a discussion of the Companys accounting estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in its application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Reserves All of the reserve data in this Form 10 K are estimates. The Companys estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by the Companys engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the Companys depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, the Companys DD&A rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves would also trigger an impairment analysis and could result in an impairment charge. The SEC requested clarification, which the Company provided, as to the Companys Israel and Equatorial Guinea gas reserves recorded in excess of existing contract amounts. SEC guidelines do not limit reserve bookings only to contracted volumes if it can be demonstrated that there is reasonable certainty that a market exists, which the Company believes exists in both of these situations. The Israel gas contract is for a period of 11 years. The Israel gas market, as estimated by the Israeli Ministry of National Infrastructure, from 2005 to 2020, is twenty times greater than Noble Energys uncontracted net estimated proved reserves. In Equatorial Guinea, the gas contract, which runs through 2026, is between the field owners and the methanol plant owners. Noble Energy, through its subsidiaries, holds a working interest in the field as well as an interest in the methanol plant. The Company has recorded reserves through the end of the concessions term in 2040. Noble Energy has obtained independent third party engineer reserve estimates for both of these projects. Oil and Gas Properties The Company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. The alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method. Under the successful efforts method, costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit of production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property by property basis as estimated by Company engineers. Application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals, during the periods the costs are incurred. Under the full cost method, these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of DD&A expense. The Company believes the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use to account for its crude oil and natural gas production activities because during periods of active exploration, this 24 method results in a more conservative measurement of net assets and net income. If the Company had used the full cost method, its financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties The Company assesses proved crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than the current net book value. Estimated future cash flows are based on managements expectations for the future and include estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs can result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment. The Company recognized $31.9 million of impairments in 2003, primarily related to a reserve revision on a property in the Gulf of Mexico after recompletion and remediation activities produced less than expected results. The Company also performs periodic assessments of individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, estimated future commodity prices and operating costs, availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political climate in areas in which the Company operates impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions. In December 2003, the Company elected not to pursue any additional exploration efforts in the Nam Con Son Basin of Vietnam. As a result, the Company wrote off its investment in Vietnam. Asset Retirement Obligation The Companys asset retirement obligations (ARO) consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO; estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements; the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used; inflation rates; and future advances in technology. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, the Company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through DD&A. At December 31, 2003, the Companys balance sheet included a liability for ARO of $124.5 million. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to price risk from changing commodity prices. The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in determining types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties and their creditworthiness. The Company accounts for its derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings. Therefore, prior to settlement of the derivative instruments, changes in the fair market value can cause significant increases or decreases in AOCI. For derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value must be reported in the current period, rather than in the period in which the forecasted transaction occurs. This may result in significant increases or decreases in current period net income. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance The Companys balance sheet includes deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards. Ultimately, realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback/carryforward period to absorb future deductible temporary differences or a carryforward. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation 25 allowance is required. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. As a result of managements current assessment, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances associated with certain foreign loss carryforwards have decreased from $21.1 million in 2002 to $14.5 million in 2003. This change was due to the elimination of the carryforward and offsetting valuation allowance associated with Vietnam, the elimination of the valuation allowance associated with Israel and the partial elimination of the valuation allowance associated with China. Because of the relatively short carryforward period in China and the lack of a long term fixed price contract, the valuation allowance associated with China was not fully eliminated. The Company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in its reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes will be utilized prior to their expiration. As a result, the Company may determine that the deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be increased or decreased. Such changes would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense. Pension Plan The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans. The actuarial determination of the projected benefit obligation and related benefit expense requires that certain assumptions be made regarding such variables as expected return on plan assets, discount rates, rate of compensation increase, estimated employee turnover rates and retirement dates, lump sum election rates, mortality rate, retiree utilization rates for health care services and health care cost trend rates. The selection of assumptions requires considerable judgment concerning future events and has a significant impact on the amount of the obligation recorded on the Companys balance sheets and on the amount of expense included on the Companys statements of operations, as well as on funding. Noble Energy bases its determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had cumulative asset losses of approximately $7.0 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The Company utilizes the services of an outside actuarial firm to assist in the calculations of the projected benefit obligation and related costs. The Company and its actuaries use historical data and forecasts to determine assumptions. In selecting the assumption for expected long term rate of return on assets, the Company considers the average rate of earnings expected on the funds to be invested to provide for plan benefits. This includes considering the plans asset allocation, historical returns on these types of assets, the current economic environment and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan. It is assumed that the long term asset mix will be consistent with the target asset allocation of 70 percent equity and 30 percent fixed income, with a range of plus or minus 10 percent acceptable degree of variation in the plans asset allocation. The discount rate is determined by analyzing the interest rates implicit in current annuity contract prices and available yields on high quality fixed income securities. By definition, discount rates reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. The expected return assumption for 2004 is 8.5 percent and the assumed discount rate for 2004 is 6.25 percent, both of which are the same as 2003. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview The Companys primary cash needs are to fund capital expenditures related to the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, to repay outstanding borrowings or to pay other contractual commitments, for interest payments on debt, to pay cash dividends on common stock and to fund contributions to the 26 Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Companys traditional sources of liquidity are its cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities. Funds may also be generated from occasional sales of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties. The Company made significant progress during 2003 in improving liquidity and financial flexibility. Reduction in international capital commitments due to completion of major capital intensive projects is expected to increase flexibility and liquidity in 2004. With these projects completed or nearing completion, international capital commitments are declining rapidly while, at the same time, they are beginning to contribute to the Companys financial and operating results. A $100 million increase in the Companys 364 day credit facility will also provide increased liquidity in 2004. The Company improved its balance sheet leverage during 2003 and achieved a reduction in its ratio of debt to book capital (defined as the Companys total debt plus its equity) to 46 percent at December 31, 2003, compared to 50 percent at December 31, 2002. The Company reduced total debt by $89.3 million during 2003. The Companys current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was .73:1 at December 31, 2003, compared with .66:l at December 31, 2002. The improvement in the current ratio in 2003, as compared to 2002, resulted from increases in year end cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments in current assets which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable, current installments of long term debt and derivative financial instruments in current liabilities. In 2003, total current assets increased by 54 percent as compared to 2002 while total current liabilities increased only 39 percent for the same period. Cash Flows Operating Activities The Company reported a $95.8 million year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $602.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $507.0 million in 2002 and $628.2 million in 2001. The 2003 increase was driven by an overall production increase of four percent and higher realized commodity prices. The increase was also impacted by higher distributions from the Companys unconsolidated methanol subsidiary and a growing contribution from electricity sales. The $121.2 million decrease in 2002, as compared to 2001, was due primarily to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher crude oil prices and production volumes. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $444.8 million, $577.5 million and $871.7 million for the years ending December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys investing activities relate primarily to expenditures made for the exploration and development of oil and gas properties and have been decreasing due to declining capital commitments. During 2003, expenditures were offset by the receipt of $81.1 million from sales of non core assets. Additionally, the Company funded the Aspect acquisition in 2001 for approximately $97.8 million, net of $9.3 million cash acquired and 405,778 shares of treasury stock. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $111.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2003. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $12.8 million and $293.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank debt, repayment of notes payable, the payment of cash dividends and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Also included in financing activities was the repayment of an obligation of $36.6 million related to treasury stock in 2003. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2003 as compared to 2002 resulted from repayments of bank debt and repayment of the treasury stock obligation in addition to a decrease in bank borrowings. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2002 as compared to 2001 related primarily to a decrease in bank borrowings. 27 Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures incurred in oil and gas activities, downstream projects, acquisitions, and corporate and other consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Oil and gas mineral interests, equipment and facilities $ 492,764 $ 543,967 $ 667,499 Downstream projects 45,134 57,646 95,716 Aspect acquisition 97,792 Corporate and other 6,119 3,185 1,932 Total capital expenditures (1) $ 544,017 $ 604,798 $ 862,939 (1) Total capital expenditures include seismic, lease rentals and other miscellaneous expenditures, which are expensed through the statements of operations and are not included in capital expenditures from investing activities. Capital expenditures from investing activities consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Capital expenditures (1) $ 527,386 $ 595,739 $ 738,706 Aspect acquisition, net of cash acquired 97,792 Total capital expenditures from investing activities $ 527,386 $ 595,739 $ 836,498 (1) Capital expenditures do not include expenditures for the methanol plant. Those expenditures are included in cash flows from investing activities investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries. Capital expenditures budget $ 510,000 $ 519,000 $ 625,000 Capital expenditures have shown year over year declines of $60.8 million or 10 percent (2003 to 2002) and $258.1 million or 30 percent (2002 to 2001). These decreases in spending are the result of declining capital commitments due to the completion, or near completion, of major capital intensive projects in international locations. During 2003, the Company expended $544.0 million compared to a budget of $510 million. The primary reason for the additional capital expenditures was due to the acceleration of the initial costs to begin the Phase 2B expansion in Equatorial Guinea. During 2002, the Company expended $604.8 million compared to a budget of $519 million. The primary additional capital expenditures were for the completion of the gas to power project in Ecuador and the continued development of the Israel project. During 2001, the Company expended $862.9 million compared to a budget of $625 million. The primary additional expenditures in 2001 were for the Aspect acquisition, which was $97.8 million and not included in the budget, and the completion of the methanol plant in Equatorial Guinea, along with the development of the gas to power project in Ecuador. 2004 Budget The Companys 2004 capital expenditure budget totals $459.7 million, a decline of 15 percent compared to 2003 actual capital expenditures. The reduced budget results from the completion of two major international projects, the Phase 2A condensate expansion project in Equatorial Guinea and the Mari B natural gas project in Israel. The 2004 capital budget has allocated approximately 35 percent to exploration opportunities and 65 percent to production and development projects. The budget allocates $270.4 million, or 59 percent, to domestic spending with approximately two thirds for the offshore division and one third for the onshore division. Of the total domestic capital budget, approximately 55 percent is for exploration and 45 percent is for production and development. The budget allocates $189.3 million, or 41 percent, to international expenditures with 84 percent for production and development 28 projects. Noble Energy has planned expenditures allocated to regions where the Company is most active, including the Middle East and Africa ($95.3 million), the Far East and Latin America ($73.8 million) and the North Sea ($20.2 million). The Company expects that its 2004 capital expenditure budget will be funded primarily from cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of its offshore asset package expected to occur during the first half of 2004. The Company will evaluate its level of capital spending throughout the year based upon drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations and property acquisitions. Acquisitions The Company has made no significant acquisitions since 2001 when it acquired interests in certain wells located along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and an interest in future drilling prospects from Aspect Energy for $97.8 million, net of $9.3 million cash acquired and 405,778 shares of treasury stock. Asset Sales The Company has sold a number of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties over the past three years. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $81.1 million, $20.4 million and $1.4 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales of properties during 2003 included reserves of approximately 108 Bcfe, or four percent, of year end 2002 proved reserves. Sales of properties during 2002 included reserves of approximately 25 Bcfe. The Company believes the disposition of non strategic properties allows it to concentrate efforts on strategic properties and reduce leverage. Financing Activities Debt The Companys debt totaled $933.7 million at December 31, 2003, of which $776.0 million was long term with maturities ranging from 2005 to 2097. The Companys $125 million Series A 2 Notes, $7.9 million of the Aspect acquisition note and $20.7 million of Israel debt are due during 2004 and are classified as short term on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company expects to fund the repayments primarily from a combination of operating cash flows, draw downs of the credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of non core properties. The Company has a $400 million credit agreement due November 30, 2006. The credit facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and exposes the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate is based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 60 to 145 basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating. At December 31, 2003, there was $140 million borrowed against this credit agreement leaving $260 million of unused borrowing capacity. The Company entered into a new $300 million 364 day credit agreement effective November 3, 2003, which represents an increase in capacity of $100 million over the previous facility. The credit agreement is with certain commercial lending institutions and exposes the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate is based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 62.5 to 150 basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating. At December 31, 2003, there was $190 million borrowed against this credit agreement leaving $110 million of unused borrowing capacity. The agreement has a maturity date of October 28, 2004 for the revolving commitment and a final maturity date of October 28, 2005 for the term commitment that includes any balance remaining after the revolving commitment matures. During 2004, a subsidiary of the Company borrowed a total of $150.0 million from certain commercial lending institutions. The interest rate on the borrowing is London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus an effective range of 60 to 130 basis points depending upon credit rating and the borrowing is for a term of five years. Proceeds were used to reduce amounts due under the $400 million credit agreement. Financial covenants on both the $400 million and $300 million credit facilities include the following: (a) the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Exploration Expense (EBITDAX) to interest expense for any consecutive period of four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter may not be less than 4.0 to 1.0; (b) the total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, may not exceed 60 percent at any time; and (c) the total asset value of the Companys restricted entities may not be less than $800 million at any time. 29 The Company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2003, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a payable of $4.0 million related to an outstanding interest rate lock. The Company made cash interest payments of $46.0 million, $47.6 million and $41.7 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Dividends The Company paid quarterly cash dividends of four cents per share from 1989 through the third quarter 2003. In October 2003, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of five cents per common share. This payment represents an increase of one cent per share, or 25 percent, over the Companys previous quarterly payment of four cents per share. Total dividends paid during 2003 increased $.6 million, or seven percent, over 2002 due to the higher dividend rate. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Stock Repurchase Program In accordance with a Board approved stock repurchase forward program, one of the Companys banks purchased 1,044,454 shares of Company stock on the open market during 2001 and 2002. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. As a result, the Company recorded an additional 1,044,454 shares of treasury stock at a cost of $36.6 million and an obligation of $36.6 million. In December 2003, the Company paid the obligation in full. Exercise of Stock Options The Company received $24.7 million, $7.7 million and $12.3 million from the exercise of stock options during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of stock options fluctuate primarily based on the price at which the Companys common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange in relation to the exercise price of the options issued. During 2003 and 2001, the Companys stock reached higher sales prices than during 2002, resulting in the exercise of more options and more proceeds to the Company. In addition, during 2003, stock options were exercised at a higher average price than during 2001 and 2002. Other Contributions to Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company made contributions of $14.6 million to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans during 2003, $10.9 million during 2002 and $3.7 million during 2001. The Company expects to make cash contributions of $2.0 million to its pension plan during 2004. The decrease in the expected contribution for 2004 is due primarily to the higher actual return on pension plan assets experienced during 2003 and an expectation of a continued positive return on plan assets during 2004 due to the recovery of market conditions. During 2003, the actual return on plan assets was a positive $7.6 million, while the returns in 2002 and 2001 were a negative $3.5 million and a negative $1.5 million, respectively. The value of the plan assets has tended to follow market performance. The expected return assumption for 2004 is 8.5 percent and the assumed discount rate for 2004 is 6.25 percent, both of which are the same as 2003. A one percent decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in an increase in benefit expense of $.7 million in 2003. Federal Income Taxes The Company made cash payments for federal income taxes of $55.5 million during 2003 and $66.1 million during 2001. During 2002, the Company received a federal tax refund of $40.4 million. The refund related to large estimated tax payments made during the first half of 2001 followed by a period of declining commodity prices, which resulted in lower taxable income by the end of 2001. Contingencies During 2003, the Company paid $1.9 million in settlement of two legal proceedings conducted in the ordinary course of business. During 2002, the Company paid $7.0 million in settlement of a legal proceeding conducted in the ordinary course of business. The Company regularly analyzes current information and accrues for probable liabilities on the disposition of certain matters, as necessary. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 30 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. (in thousands) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years After 5 Years Outstanding debt $ 933,674 $ 153,674 $ 330,000 $ $ 450,000 Asset retirement obligation 124,537 1,023 63,034 19,489 40,991 Drilling obligations 3,924 3,924 Building lease 14,292 1,588 4,764 3,176 4,764 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,076,427 $ 160,209 $ 397,798 $ 22,665 $ 495,755 In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company maintains letters of credit in support of certain performance obligations. Outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately $18 million at December 31, 2003. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income and Revenues The Companys net income for 2003 was $78.0 million, an increase of $60.3 million from 2002. The increase was due to the following: crude oil sales increased $106.9 million, natural gas sales increased $123.2 million and income from unconsolidated subsidiaries increased $31.1 million. The increases were offset by increased oil and gas operations expense (lease operating expense, workover expense, production taxes and other related lifting costs from continuing operations) of $40.5 million, increased DD&A of $72.5 million, a non cash impairment of $31.9 million, a $9.3 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligation, a non cash pre tax charge for change in accounting principle of $9.0 million and a $4.8 million increase in selling, general and administrative (SG&A). In addition, loss from discontinued operations increased $15.6 million. The decrease of $115.9 million in net income for 2002 compared to 2001 was due to a $151.3 million decrease in natural gas sales, offset by a $43.4 million increase in crude oil sales. 31 Natural Gas Information Natural gas revenues increased 35 percent in 2003, compared to 2002, due to a 43 percent increase in natural gas prices, offset by a one percent decrease in daily natural gas production. Natural gas revenues for 2002, compared to 2001, decreased 30 percent due to a 25 percent decrease in natural gas prices coupled with a four percent decrease in daily natural gas production. The table below depicts average daily natural gas production and prices from continuing operations by area for the last three years. 2003 2002 2001 Mcfpd Price Mcfpd Price Mcfpd Price United States 260,560 $ 4.75 280,836 $ 3.24 311,663 $ 4.21 North Sea 13,861 $ 3.86 16,991 $ 3.14 17,830 $ 3.51 Equatorial Guinea (1) 39,906 $ .25 34,382 $ .25 24,488 $ .25 Other International (2) 22,284 $ .41 8,799 $ .38 1,651 $ .95 Total (3) 336,611 $ 4.13 341,008 $ 2.89 355,632 $ 3.86 (1) Natural gas in Equatorial Guinea is under a 25 year contract for $.25 per MMBTU. (2) Ecuador natural gas volumes are included in Other International production, but are not included in natural gas sales revenues and average price for 2003 and 2002. Because the gas to power project in Ecuador is 100 percent owned by Noble Energy, intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. (3) Reflects a reduction of $.44 per Mcf in 2003, and increases of $.05 per Mcf in 2002 and $.04 per Mcf in 2001 from hedging in the United States. The 51,103 Mcfpd decline in natural gas production for the United States from 2001 to 2003 is the result of reduced domestic drilling and natural decline rates for properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast region. The 3,969 Mcfpd decline in natural gas production for the North Sea from 2001 to 2003 is the result of natural gas decline rates for properties in the United Kingdom section of the North Sea. The 15,418 Mcfpd increase in natural gas production for Equatorial Guinea from 2001 to 2003 is the result of the startup of the methanol plant in May 2001 and the expansion of the Phase 2A project. The 20,633 Mcfpd increase in natural gas production for Other International from 2001 to 2003 is the result of the startup of the gas to power project in Ecuador during 2002. 2003 Daily Production by Quarter Natural Gas Crude Oil 32 Crude Oil Information Crude oil revenues increased 42 percent during 2003, compared to 2002, due to a 14 percent increase in crude oil prices and a 24 percent increase in daily crude oil production. Crude oil revenues for 2002, compared to 2001, increased 20 percent due to a three percent increase in crude oil prices coupled with a 17 percent increase in daily crude oil production. The table below depicts average daily crude oil production and prices from continuing operations by area for the last three years. 2003 2002 2001 Bopd Price Bopd Price Bopd Price United States 16,084 $ 26.21 13,187 $ 23.29 12,926 $ 23.02 North Sea 7,412 $ 29.95 7,847 $ 25.15 4,688 $ 23.36 Equatorial Guinea 6,377 $ 27.93 5,259 $ 23.88 4,620 $ 23.03 Other International 6,141 $ 28.75 2,821 $ 26.58 2,739 $ 26.67 Total (1) 36,014 $ 27.72 29,114 $ 24.22 24,973 $ 23.49 (1) Reflects a reduction of $1.01 per Bbl in 2003, $.02 per Bbl in 2002 and an increase of $.01 per Bbl in 2001 from hedging in the United States. The 3,158 Bopd increase in crude oil production for the United States from 2001 to 2003 is the result of success of the Companys deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico region. The 2,724 Bopd increase in crude oil production for the North Sea from 2001 to 2003 is the result of commencement of production from the Hanze field, offshore in the Netherlands in late 2001. The 1,757 Bopd increase in crude oil production for Equatorial Guinea from 2001 to 2003 is the result of the continued development of the Alba field and the expansion of the Phase 2A project. The 3,402 Bopd increase in crude oil production for Other International from 2001 to 2003 is the result of the startup of the CDX field, located in South Bohai Bay off the coast of China, in January 2003. Electricity Sales Ecuador Integrated Power Project The Company, through its subsidiaries, EDC Ecuador Ltd. and MachalaPower Cia. Ltda., has a 100 percent ownership interest in an integrated gas to power project. The project includes the Amistad natural gas field, offshore Ecuador, which supplies fuel to the Machala power plant. During 2003, the first full year of operations, the combined project generated $7.2 million of operating income from the generation of 751,689 MW of electricity. The average sales price was 7.7 cents per Kwh. During 2002, after commencement of commercial electricity generation in mid September, the Machala power plant contributed $2.3 million of operating income from generation of 269,229 MW of electricity. The average sales price was 6.8 cents per Kwh. Income from Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Methanol operations produced $40.6 million, $9.5 million and $7.0 million of operating income, net to Noble Energys interest, during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. AMPCO, an unconsolidated subsidiary in which the Company owns a 45 percent interest, owns a methanol plant in Equatorial Guinea that began production of commercial grade methanol during the second quarter of 2001. The Companys share of AMPCO methanol sales volumes was 122 million gallons in 2003, 105 million gallons in 2002 and 54 million gallons in 2001. Average realized methanol prices were $.65 per gallon, $.43 per gallon and $.39 per gallon for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 33 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company, from time to time, uses various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. Such instruments include fixed price hedges, variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. Although these derivative instruments expose the Company to credit risk, the Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and believes that losses from nonperformance are unlikely to occur. Hedging gains and losses related to the Companys crude oil and natural gas production are recorded in oil and gas sales and royalties. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company included a $67.5 million reduction of sales and increased sales of $5.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively, related to its cash flow hedges in oil and gas sales and royalties. Costs and Expenses Crude oil and natural gas operations expense from continuing operations increased $40.5 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in crude oil and natural gas operating expense was due to several factors, including new operations in China, increased production and the startup of Phase 2A in Equatorial Guinea, new production in the Gulf of Mexico and higher production taxes. Crude oil and natural gas operating expense increased $1.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The table below depicts the crude oil and natural gas operations expense from continuing operations by area for the last three years.

(2) Production did not begin until 2004. In 2003, DD&A expense from continuing operations increased $72.5 million compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher domestic DD&A rates and increased production volumes. The unit rate of DD&A per BOE was $9.20 in 2003. Included in DD&A for 2003 is $20.6 million of abandoned assets expense and $20.2 million of DD&A related to asset retirement obligations, which increased DD&A by $1.26 per BOE. In 2002, DD&A expense increased 34 $3.4 million compared to 2001. The unit rate of DD&A per BOE was $7.55 in 2002 and $7.58 in 2001. The table below depicts the DD&A from continuing operations for the years ended December 31: (in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 United States $ 254,041 $ 192,708 $ 202,732 North Sea 28,219 28,279 16,537 Israel 40 31 23 Equatorial Guinea 6,115 5,849 3,889 Other International and Corporate 20,928 10,014 10,335 Total DD&A Expense $ 309,343 $ 236,881 $ 233,516 The Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 and recognized, as the fair value of asset retirement obligations, $109.4 million related to the United States and $15.1 million related to the North Sea. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the Company recognized a charge for this cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $5.8 million ($9.0 million net of $3.2 million tax). The Company had previously accumulated a provision for future dismantlement and restoration costs of $84.1 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, the total asset retirement obligations of $199.3 million consist of $175.9 million for the United States and $23.4 million for the North Sea and are included in future production and development costs for purposes of estimating the future net revenues relating to the Companys proved reserves. Crude oil and natural gas exploration expense consists of dry hole expense, unproved lease amortization, seismic, staff expense and other miscellaneous exploration expense, including lease rentals. The table below depicts the exploration expense by area for the last three years. (in thousands) Consolidated United States North Sea Israel Equatorial Guinea Other Intl 2003 Dry hole expense $ 63,637 $ 32,408 $ 4,023 $ 6,711 $ $ 20,495 Unproved lease amortization 33,381 25,296 1,264 900 5,921 Seismic 17,674 15,903 1,662 51 58 Staff expense 30,182 17,483 3,105 214 83 9,297 Other 3,944 3,601 449 (106 ) Total exploration expense $ 148,818 $ 94,691 $ 10,503 $ 7,825 $ 134 $ 35,665 2002 Dry hole expense $ 81,396 $ 64,449 $ 544 $ $ $ 16,403 Unproved lease amortization 21,254 19,426 178 900 750 Seismic 20,492 14,282 827 1,671 1,341 2,371 Staff expense 24,928 20,081 2,833 54 1,960 Other 2,631 2,457 828 (654 ) Total exploration expense $ 150,701 $ 120,695 $ 5,210 $ 2,625 $ 1,341 $ 20,830 2001 Dry hole expense $ 99,684 $ 54,810 $ 28,992 $ $ $ 15,882 Unproved lease amortization 17,213 15,112 1,725 375 1 Seismic 15,607 13,328 2,209 5 39 26 Staff expense 17,148 14,431 1,605 1,112 Other 2,444 2,811 419 (786 ) Total exploration expense $ 152,096 $ 100,492 $ 34,950 $ 380 $ 39 $ 16,235 Impairment of Operating Assets The Company recognized $31.9 million of impairments in 2003, primarily related to a reserve revision on the East Cameron 338 field in the Gulf of Mexico after recompletion and remediation activities produced less than expected results. An analysis of the performance response of the field resulted in a reduction in proved reserves of 2.2 MMBoe. 35 The impairment should result in substantially lower depletion costs in 2004. The Company recorded no operating asset impairments during 2002 and 2001. Individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased $4.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002 and increased $3.5 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in SG&A expenses for 2003 is due to increased corporate governance costs, professional fees and other costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance and increased salary expense. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 is due to increased salary and legal expense, as well as increased costs associated with the Companys international expansion. Gathering, Marketing and Processing NEMI markets the majority of the Companys domestic natural gas, as well as certain third party natural gas. NEMI sells natural gas directly to end users, natural gas marketers, industrial users, interstate and intrastate pipelines, power generators and local distribution companies. NEMI markets a portion of the Companys domestic crude oil, as well as certain third party crude oil. The Company records all of NEMIs sales, net of cost of goods sold, as GMP proceeds and NEMIs expenses as GMP. All intercompany sales and expenses have been eliminated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The GMP proceeds less expenses for NEMI are reflected in the table below.

NEMI, from time to time, employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to natural gas price risk. Most of the purchases made by NEMI are on an index basis; however, purchasers in the markets in which NEMI sells often require fixed or NYMEX related pricing. NEMI records gains and losses on derivative instruments using mark to market accounting. NEMI recorded a loss of $.2 million, a gain of $.9 million and a loss of $.5 million in GMP proceeds during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to derivative instruments. Interest Expense Interest rates have consistently decreased over the past three years while Company borrowings have steadily increased, peaking early in 2003. Throughout the remainder of the year, the Company steadily paid down its debt resulting in a year over year decrease of $2.9 million in interest expense at December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 36 2002. Interest expense totaled $64.0 million at December 31, 2002, which was a $10.0 million increase over interest expense of $54.0 million at December 31, 2001. The Company believes that interest rates will remain stable in 2004 and expects to continue paying down its debt throughout the year, which should result in lower interest expense at year end 2004. Pension Expense The Company recognized net periodic benefit cost related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $7.9 million, $8.5 million and $5.7 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This expense included an expected return on pension plan assets of $5.9 million, $5.5 million and $4.9 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company is exposed to credit risk and takes reasonable steps to protect itself from nonperformance by its debtors, but is not able to predict sudden changes in its debtors creditworthiness. The Company periodically assesses its provision for bad debt allowance. The Company had allowances for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 of $6.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase in the allowance in 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to an allowance of $4.7 million related to financial derivative contracts with one of the Companys counterparties. Income Taxes Income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to $51.7 million in 2003 from $19.8 million in 2002 primarily from the increase in income. However, the effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5 percent in 2003 from 70.9 percent in 2002. During 2003, the Companys income from international operations increased over 2002, but represented a smaller proportion of the Companys total income. Some of the countries in which the international operations were conducted have a higher statutory income tax rate than the United States. Also impacting the effective rate in 2003 was the realization of approximately $15.6 million of tax benefits for certain prior year costs incurred in Israel and Vietnam. The $45.2 million decrease in income tax expense for 2002 was due to a $122.2 million decrease in income from continuing operations offset by an increase in the effective income tax rate. The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations increased to 70.9 percent in 2002 from 43.3 percent in 2001. During 2002, a larger proportion of the Companys income was from international operations. Some of the countries in which international operations are conducted have a higher statutory income tax rate than the United States. In the Netherlands, the Company had significantly higher income in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to a full year of production from the Hanze field. In Equatorial Guinea, the Company had higher income in 2002 compared to 2001 from a full year of the methanol plants operations and the impact of nondeductible interest expense. In the United Kingdom, the Company had higher income in 2002 compared to 2001 and was impacted by an increase in the countrys corporate tax rate. In Ecuador, the Company had no income prior to 2002. Discontinued Operations Pursuant to SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Companys consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations and assets of the properties being sold as discontinued operations. The net income from discontinued operations was classified on the consolidated statements of operations as Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax. During 2003, the Company identified five domestic property packages for disposition. Bids have now been received on all five packages. During 2003, property sales closed on four of the five packages, with the remaining property package expected to close during the first half of 2004. Total pretax proceeds on all five packages, before closing adjustments, are expected to be in excess of $110.0 million. 37 The Company recorded a loss, net of tax, related to discontinued operations of $6.1 million in 2003. Included in the discontinued operations loss was a $59.2 million ($38.5 million, net of tax) non cash write down to market value for certain of the five property packages. The Company has reclassified the results of operations associated with the five property packages for 2001 and 2002 to discontinued operations. This reclassification did not have an effect on net income as previously reported for 2001 and 2002. As a result of the reclassification, oil and gas sales and royalties are lower, as well as the associated oil and gas operations and DD&A expense. Summarized results of discontinued operations are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues: Oil and gas sales and royalties $ 106,339 $ 91,576 $ 154,873 Costs and Expenses: Write down to market value and realized loss 59,171 Oil and gas operations 27,731 28,468 29,893 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 28,762 48,405 50,500 115,664 76,873 80,393 Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes (9,325 ) 14,703 74,480 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) (3,264 ) 5,146 26,068 Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations $ (6,061 ) $ 9,557 $ 48,412 Key Statistics: Daily Production Liquids (Bbl) 4,106 4,923 5,688 Natural Gas (Mcf) 32,823 46,615 66,812 Average Realized Price Liquids ($/Bbl) $ 27.71 $ 22.57 $ 22.55 Natural Gas ($/Mcf) $ 5.41 $ 3.00 $ 4.43 The long term debt of the Company is recorded at the consolidated level and is not reflected by each component. Thus, the Company has not allocated interest expense to the discontinued operations. FUTURE TRENDS The Company expects crude oil and natural gas production from continuing operations to increase in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003 assuming commodity prices stay in the range experienced in 2003. The increased production in 2004 is expected primarily from ramp up of the Phase 2A expansion of the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea and the initial sales from the Mari B field, offshore Israel. The increase in 2005 is expected primarily from the continued expansion of markets in Israel and the Phase 2B expansion of the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The Company recently set its 2004 capital expenditures budget at approximately $459.7 million. Such expenditures are planned to be funded principally through internally generated cash flows. The Company believes that it has the capital structure to take advantage of strategic acquisitions, as they become available, through internally generated cash flows or available lines of credit and other borrowing opportunities. Management believes that the Company is well positioned with its balanced reserves of crude oil and natural gas and downstream projects. The uncertainty of commodity prices continues to affect the crude oil, natural gas and methanol industries. The Company cannot predict the extent to which its revenues will be affected by inflation, government regulation or changing prices. 38 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. This SAB revises or rescinds portions of the revenue recognition interpretive guidance included in the SAB codification to make it consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance. The principal revisions relate to revenue recognition guidance no longer necessary due to developments in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The pronouncement had no impact on the Companys historical financial statements. During 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued several new pronouncements: SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities that fall within the scope of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with certain exceptions, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companys historical financial statements. SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 150. As a result, the Company recorded an additional 1.04 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $36.6 million and an obligation of $36.6 million. SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and 106, revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans and requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. Most of the requirements are effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The Company has made additional disclosures in its 2003 financial statements in compliance with SFAS No. 132. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities. This Interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied Interpretation No. 46 prior to issuance of this revised Interpretation. Otherwise, application of this Interpretation is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The provisions of this Interpretation would be applied if the Company were to acquire an interest in a variable interest entity. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companys historical financial statements. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) became law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare. FASB Staff Position 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, allows deferral of the recognition of the Acts provisions until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued. The Company has elected to defer recognition of the effects of the Act in the accounting for and disclosure of its postretirement benefit plan in accordance with the Staff Position. Authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is pending. Final guidance could require the Company to change previously reported information. The Company does not believe that the effects of the Act will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 39 Accounting for Costs Associated with Mineral Rights During 2003, a reporting issue arose regarding the application of certain provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to companies in the extractive industries, including oil and gas companies. The issue is whether SFAS No. 142 requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet, apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs, and provide specific footnote disclosures. The EITF has added the treatment of oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda, which may result in a change in how Noble Energy classifies these assets. Historically, the Company has included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as a component of oil and gas properties. If it is ultimately determined that SFAS No. 142 requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet, net of amortization, the Company most likely would be required to reclassify certain amounts out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item. The Companys cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with existing successful efforts accounting rules. If it is ultimately determined that SFAS No. 142 requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet, Noble Energy would be required to reclassify the estimated amounts as follows: December 31, Intangible Assets (in thousands) 2003 2002 Proved leasehold acquisition costs $ 835,738 $ 1,083,103 Unproved leasehold acquisition costs 127,194 153,789 Total leasehold acquisition costs 962,932 1,236,892 Less: accumulated depletion (496,227 ) (554,932 ) Net leasehold acquisition costs $ 466,705 $ 681,960 Further, the Company does not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on compliance with covenants under the Companys debt agreements. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Cash Flow Hedges The Company, from time to time, uses various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. Such instruments include fixed price hedges, variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. Although these derivative instruments expose the Company to credit risk, the Company takes reasonable steps to protect itself from nonperformance by its counterparties including periodic assessment of necessary provisions for bad debt allowance; however, the Company is not able to predict sudden changes in its counterparties creditworthiness. The Company accounts for its derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and has elected to designate its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reflected at fair value on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are reported in AOCI until the forecasted transaction occurs. Gains and losses from such derivatives related to the Companys crude oil and natural gas production and which qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in oil and gas sales and royalties on the Companys consolidated statements of operations upon sale of the associated products. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly based on total changes in the derivative instruments fair value. Any ineffective portion of the derivative instruments change in fair value is recognized immediately in other income. 40 During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company entered into various crude oil and natural gas fixed price swaps, costless collars and costless collar combinations related to its crude oil and natural gas production. The tables below depict the various transactions. Natural Gas 2003 2002 2001 Hedge MMBTUpd 190,038 170,274 16,947 Fixed price range $5.23 $5.41 Floor price range $3.25 $3.80 $2.00 $3.50 $3.25 $5.00 Ceiling price range $4.00 $5.25 $2.45 $5.10 $4.60 $6.25 Percent of daily production 56 % 50 % 5 % Gain (loss) per Mcf $ (.44 ) $ .05 $ .04 Crude Oil 2003 2002 2001 Hedge Bpd 15,793 5,247 126 Fixed price $ 27.81 Floor price range $23.00 $27.00 $23.00 $24.00 Ceiling price range $27.20 $35.05 $29.30 $30.10 Percent of daily production 44 % 18 % .5 % Gain (loss) per Bbl $ (1.01 ) $ (.02 ) $ .01 During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company included a reduction of $67.5 million and gains of $5.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively, related to its cash flow hedges in oil and gas sales and royalties. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment. During 2003, the Company recorded $.5 million of ineffectiveness related to its cash flow hedges. No ineffectiveness was recorded for 2002 and 2001. In 2001, the Company only had financial derivatives in the fourth quarter. Of these fourth quarter derivatives, 25,000 MMBTU of natural gas per day was terminated early. Amounts in AOCI were reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings, resulting in an increase in oil and gas sales and royalties of $6.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2001. As a result, the Company recognized an additional $.70 per MMBTU on the 25,000 MMBTU of natural gas per day in 2001. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had entered into costless collars related to its natural gas and crude oil production to support the Companys investment program as follows: Natural Gas Crude Oil Production Period MMBTUpd Price Per MMBTU Floor Ceiling Bopd Price Per Bbl Floor Ceiling 1Q 2004 120,000 $4.81 $7.77 15,000 $25.33 $31.53 2Q 2004 120,000 $4.06 $5.95 15,000 $24.83 $31.22 3Q 2004 120,000 $4.19 $5.99 15,000 $25.00 $31.13 4Q 2004 120,000 $4.19 $6.42 5,000 $24.00 $30.00 The contracts entitle the Company (floating price payor) to receive settlement from the counterparty (fixed price payor) for each calculation period in amounts, if any, by which the settlement price for the last scheduled NYMEX trading day applicable for each calculation period is less than the floor price. The Company would pay the counterparty if the settlement price for the last scheduled NYMEX trading day applicable for each calculation period is more than the ceiling price. The amount payable by the floating price payor, if the floating price is above the ceiling price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the floating price over the ceiling price in respect of each calculation period. The amount payable by the fixed price payor, if the floating price is below the 41 floor price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the floor price over the floating price in respect of each calculation period. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the balance in AOCI included net deferred losses of $7.6 million and $14.6 million, respectively, related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. The net deferred losses are net of deferred income tax benefit of $4.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively. If commodity prices were to stay the same as they were at December 31, 2003, approximately $11.2 million of deferred losses related to the fair values of crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments included in AOCI at December 31, 2003 would be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months as the forecasted transactions occur, and would be recorded as a reduction in oil and gas sales and royalties. Any actual increase or decrease in revenues will depend upon market conditions over the period during which the forecasted transactions occur. All forecasted transactions currently being hedged with crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur by December 2004. Other Derivative Instruments In addition to the derivative instruments pertaining to the Companys production as described above, NEMI, from time to time, employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to natural gas price risk. Most of the purchases made by NEMI are on an index basis; however, purchasers in the markets in which NEMI sells often require fixed or NYMEX related pricing. NEMI may use a derivative to convert the fixed or NYMEX sale to an index basis thereby determining the margin and minimizing the risk of price volatility. NEMI records gains and losses on derivative instruments using mark to market accounting. Under this accounting method, the changes in the market value of outstanding financial instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change. NEMI recorded a loss of $.2 million, a gain of $.9 million and a loss of $.5 million in GMP proceeds during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to derivative instruments. Receivables/Payables Related to Crude Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Financial Instruments At December 31, 2003, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a receivable of $56.1 million and a payable of $67.6 million related to crude oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments. At December 31, 2002, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a receivable of $10.3 million and a payable of $32.3 million related to crude oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments. During 2003, the Company had contracts with Enron North America Corporation (ENA) that resulted in gains of $6.9 million (net of allowance) included in GMP proceeds. In addition, as of December 31, 2003, the Company had NYMEX related transactions with ENA totaling 149 contracts with a mark to market receivable value of $1.8 million. Interest Rate Lock The Company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate locks used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCI, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2003, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a payable of $4.0 million related to an outstanding interest rate lock. The amount of deferred loss included in AOCI at December 31, 2003 was $2.6 million, net of tax. The Company has a $400 million credit agreement that exposes the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate is based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 60 to 145 basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating. At December 31, 2003, there was $140 million borrowed against this credit agreement with an interest rate of 2.19 percent and a maturity date of November 30, 2006. A 10 percent change in the December 31, 2003 interest rate on this $140 million would result in a change in interest expense of $.3 million. 42 The Company has a new $300 million credit agreement that exposes the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate is based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 62.5 to 150 basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization and credit rating. At December 31, 2003, there was $190 million borrowed against this credit agreement with an interest rate of 2.09 percent and a final maturity date of October 28, 2005. A 10 percent change in the December 31, 2003 interest rate on this $190 million would result in a change in interest expense of $.4 million. All other significant Company long term debt is fixed rate and, therefore, does not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivatives. The U.S. dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the Companys international operations. Transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars and recorded in the financial statements. Translation gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the Company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis. Such gains or losses are included in other income on the statements of operations. However, certain sales transactions are concluded in foreign currencies and the Company, therefore, is exposed to potential risk of loss based on fluctuation in exchange rates from time to time. Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Other Federal Securities Laws General. Noble Energy is including the following discussion to generally inform its existing and potential security holders of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect the Company and to take advantage of the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements afforded under federal securities laws. From time to time, the Companys management or persons acting on managements behalf make forward looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about the Company. These statements may include, but are not limited to, projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and the Companys future: (1) income, (2) crude oil and natural gas production, (3) crude oil and natural gas reserves and reserve replacement and (4) capital spending. Forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate, project, predict, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, goal or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Sometimes the Company will specifically describe a statement as being a forward looking statement. In addition, except for the historical information contained in this Form 10 K, the matters discussed in this Form 10 K are forward looking statements. These statements by their nature are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions and will be influenced by various factors. Should any of the assumptions underlying a forward looking statement prove incorrect, actual results could vary materially. Noble Energy believes the factors discussed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made herein or elsewhere by the Company or on its behalf. The factors listed below are not necessarily all of the important factors. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of forward looking statements. Noble Energy does not intend to update its description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises. The Company advises its stockholders that they should: (1) be aware that important factors not described below could affect the accuracy of our forward looking statements, and (2) use caution and common sense when analyzing our forward looking statements in this document or elsewhere. All of such forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Volatility and Level of Hydrocarbon Commodity Prices. Historically, natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile. These prices rise and fall based on changes in market supply and demand fundamentals and changes in the political, regulatory and economic climates and other factors that affect commodities markets generally and are outside of Noble Energys control. Some of Noble Energys projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas and crude oil. These price assumptions are used for planning purposes. The Company expects its assumptions may change over time and that actual prices in the future may differ from our estimates. Any substantial or extended change in the actual prices of natural gas and or crude oil could have a material effect on: (1) the Companys financial position and results of operations, (2) the quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that the Company 43 can economically produce, (3) the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to its properties, and (4) the Companys ability to fund its capital program. Production Rates and Reserve Replacement. Projecting future rates of crude oil and natural gas production is inherently imprecise. Producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs generally have declining production rates. Production rates depend on a number of factors, including geological, geophysical and engineering issues, weather, production curtailments or restrictions, prices for natural gas and crude oil, available transportation capacity, market demand and the political, economic and regulatory climates. Another factor affecting production rates is Noble Energys ability to replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through exploration success or acquisitions. Exploration success is difficult to predict, particularly over the short term, where results can vary widely from year to year. Moreover, the Companys ability to replace reserves over an extended period depends not only on the total volumes found, but also on the cost of finding and developing such reserves. Depending on the general price environment for natural gas and crude oil, Noble Energys finding and development costs may not justify the use of resources to explore for and develop such reserves. Reserve Estimates. Noble Energys forward looking statements are predicated, in part, on the Companys estimates of its crude oil and natural gas reserves. All of the reserve data in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by or on behalf of the Company are estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. Projecting future rates of production and timing of future development expenditures is also inexact. Many factors beyond the Companys control affect these estimates. In addition, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Therefore, estimates made by different engineers may vary. The results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may also require a revision of that estimate, and these revisions may be material. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Laws and Regulations. Noble Energys forward looking statements are generally based on the assumption that the legal and regulatory environments will remain stable. Changes in the legal and or regulatory environments could have a material effect on the Companys future results of operations and financial condition. Noble Energys ability to economically produce and sell crude oil, natural gas, methanol and power is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and laws and regulations of foreign nations, affecting: (1) crude oil and natural gas production, (2) taxes applicable to the Company and or its production, (3) the amount of crude oil and natural gas available for sale, (4) the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities, and (5) the marketing of competitive fuels. The Companys operations are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and laws and regulations of foreign nations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Noble Energys forward looking statements are generally based upon the expectation that the Company will not be required, in the near future, to expend cash to comply with environmental laws and regulations that are material in relation to its total capital expenditures program. However, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, the Company is unable to accurately predict the ultimate financial impact of compliance. Drilling and Operating Risks. Noble Energys drilling operations are subject to various risks common in the industry, including cratering, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids. In addition, a substantial amount of the Companys operations are currently offshore, domestically and internationally, and subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as loop currents, capsizing, collision, and damage or loss from severe weather. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents and adverse weather conditions. Competition. Competition in the industry is intense. Noble Energy actively competes for reserve acquisitions and exploration leases and licenses, for the labor and equipment required to operate and develop crude oil and natural gas properties and in the gathering and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, methanol and power. The Companys competitors include the major integrated oil companies, independent crude oil and natural gas concerns, individual 44 producers, natural gas and crude oil marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers, many of whom have greater financial resources than the Company. 45
