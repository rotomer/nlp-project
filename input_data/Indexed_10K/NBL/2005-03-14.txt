Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Noble Energy is an independent energy company engaged, directly or through its subsidiaries or various arrangements with other companies, in the exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas. The Company has exploration, exploitation and production operations domestically and internationally. The domestic areas consist of: offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and California; the Gulf Coast Region (Louisiana and Texas); the Mid continent Region (Oklahoma and Kansas); and the Rocky Mountain Region (Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming and California). The international areas of operations include Argentina, China, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea (Israel) and the North Sea (the Netherlands and the United Kingdom). The Company also markets domestic crude oil and natural gas production through a wholly owned subsidiary, NEMI. The Companys accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Noble Energys principal business strategy has been to create shareholder value by generating stable cash flow and production from domestic operations, while generating growth from international projects. In the U.S., the Company has a substantial onshore and offshore asset base located in established, prolific basins where the Company is aggressively pursuing exploration and exploitation opportunities. Offshore, exploration focuses on the deepwater and deep shelf areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, the Company has built a strong project portfolio and has applied innovative approaches to developing markets for stranded natural gas, including construction of a natural gas fired power plant near Machala, Ecuador, and liquefied petroleum gas and methanol plants in Equatorial Guinea. The Company had a successful year, both financially and operationally, in 2004. Financial highlights included the following: Record net income of $328.7 million, or $5.64 per share; Cash flow from operating activities of $708.2 million; A $48.7 million reduction in outstanding debt with a year end debt to book capital ratio of 38 percent; Issuance of $200 million senior notes; Increased financial flexibility with an additional $400 million credit facility; and Completion of asset disposition program first announced in July 2003. Operational highlights included the following: A 16 percent increase in daily equivalent production over 2003; Ticonderoga deepwater discovery in the Gulf of Mexico; New projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; Commencement of natural gas sales in Israel; Phase 2A ramp up in Equatorial Guinea; and Acquisition of interests in two PSCs with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Domestic Domestic operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil in 2004, and a four percent overall increase in production. During 2004, Noble Energy participated in 130 gross domestic exploration and development wells, of which 104 were successful. Based on the results of successful infill pilot projects drilled during 2004, regulatory approval for 40 acre drilling density was granted for development of the Niobrara formation in northeast Colorado. Noble Energy plans to drill up to 235 development wells in the Niobrara Trend in 2005. The 2005 program is now underway with three drilling rigs currently operating in the area. 24 During 2004, the Companys domestic division continued to make progress on significant deepwater developments in the Gulf of Mexico that are expected to add substantial new production through 2006: Swordfish (Viosca Knoll 917, 961 and 962) well completions have been finished, with production expected to commence from three wells in the second quarter of 2005 at an initial rate of approximately 10,000 Boepd, net to the Company. Noble Energy has a 60 percent working interest in Swordfish. Lorien (Green Canyon 199) an appraisal well is currently underway, with production expected to commence in the first half of 2006 at an initial rate of approximately 12,000 Boepd, net to the Company. Noble Energy has a 60 percent working interest in Lorien. Ticonderoga (Green Canyon 768) successful exploration results were announced in April 2004, with production expected to commence by mid 2006 at an initial rate of approximately 10,000 to 12,000 Boepd, net to the Company. Noble Energy has a 50 percent working interest in Ticonderoga. Production from Main Pass 293/305/306 in the Gulf of Mexico remains shut in as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Ivan during September 2004. Estimated shut in production totaled 3,500 Boepd during fourth quarter 2004 and 2,900 Boepd during third quarter 2004. The effect on total year 2004 production was 1,870 Boepd. The Company believes it has insurance coverage in an amount sufficient to make necessary repairs in order to re establish production at Main Pass. Costs related to clean up and redevelopment are insured to a limit that the Company believes will allow for restoration of production. The loss of production is not covered by business interruption insurance. International During 2002 and 2003, the Company completed major, capital intensive projects in Ecuador, China, Israel and the Phase 2A expansion, the first phase of a two phase project in Equatorial Guinea. With these important projects completed, international capital commitments declined. During 2003 and 2004, these projects contributed significantly to the Companys financial and operating results. The Phase 2B expansion in Equatorial Guinea is underway and is scheduled to be completed during 2005. The Phase 2B expansion is expected to increase both LPG and condensate production. The project includes increasing processing capacity, storage and offloading facilities at the existing LPG plant. During 2004, international production volumes increased 12,098 Boepd, or 37 percent, compared to last year, primarily from increased production in Equatorial Guinea, due to the continued ramp up of the Phase 2A expansion project, and the commencement of natural gas sales in Israel. International operations also benefited from higher realized commodity prices. During 2004, Noble Energy participated in 95 gross international exploration and development wells, of which 92 were successful. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. When alternatives exist among various accounting methods, the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts. The following is a discussion of the Companys accounting policies, estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in its application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Reserves All of the reserve data in this Form 10 K are estimates. The Companys estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by the Companys engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the Companys depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, the 25 Companys DD&A rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves could also trigger an impairment analysis and could result in an impairment charge. SEC guidelines do not limit reserve bookings to only contracted volumes if it can be demonstrated that there is reasonable certainty that a market exists. The Company has booked reserves in excess of contracted volumes for Israel due to the reasonable certainty of the existence of markets in future periods. In Israel, the Company has a natural gas contract with IEC, which is expected to run through 2014, and a contract with the Israel Bazan Refinery through the year 2015. The Israeli natural gas market, as estimated by the Israeli Ministry of National Infrastructure, from 2005 to 2020, is significantly greater than Noble Energys uncontracted net estimated proved reserves. Oil and Gas Properties The Company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. The alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method. Under the successful efforts method, costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit of production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property by property basis as estimated by Company engineers. Application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals, during the periods the costs are incurred. Under the full cost method, these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of DD&A expense. The Company believes the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use to account for its crude oil and natural gas production activities because during periods of active exploration, this method results in a more conservative measurement of net assets and net income. If the Company had used the full cost method, its financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different. Exploratory Well Costs In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting, the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well (including costs in work in progress and suspended costs on go forward projects) may be capitalized temporarily, or suspended, pending a determination of whether commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas have been discovered. Except as noted below, the Company does not capitalize the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well for more than one year following completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds crude oil and natural gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and (1) the well has found sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and (2) drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future. For certain capital intensive deepwater Gulf of Mexico or international projects, it may take the Company more than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability. The Companys ability to move forward on a project may be dependent on gaining access to transportation or processing facilities or obtaining permits and government or partner approval, the timing of which is beyond the Companys control. In such cases, exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the Company is actively pursuing such permits and approvals and believes they will be obtained. Management continuously monitors suspended exploratory well costs until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired. These costs may be charged to exploration expense in future periods if the Company decides not to pursue additional exploratory or development activities. At December 31, 2004, the balance of property, plant and equipment included $62.7 million of suspended exploratory well costs, of which $17.7 million had been capitalized for a period greater than one year. The wells relating to these suspended costs continue to be evaluated by various means including additional seismic work, drilling additional wells or evaluating the potential of the exploration wells. For more information, see Note 5 Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs of this Form 10 K. Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties The Company assesses proved crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss as a result of a triggering event and when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than the current net book value. Estimated future cash flows are based on managements expectations for the future and include estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and 26 could indicate a property impairment. The Company recorded $9.9 million of impairments in 2004, primarily related to downward reserve revisions on two domestic properties. The Company recorded $31.9 million of impairments in 2003, primarily related to a reserve revision on a property in the Gulf of Mexico after recompletion and remediation activities produced less than expected results. The Company also performs periodic assessments of individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, estimated future commodity prices and operating costs, availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political climate in areas in which the Company operates impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions. Asset Retirement Obligation The Companys asset retirement obligations (ARO) consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO; estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements; the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used; inflation rates; and future advances in technology. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, the Company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through DD&A. At December 31, 2004, the Companys balance sheet included a liability for ARO of $255.0 million, including $130.0 million for damage caused by Hurricane Ivan. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses various derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to price risk from changing commodity prices. Except for NEMIs use of derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to natural gas price risk, the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in determining types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties and the hedging counterparties creditworthiness. The Company accounts for its derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings. Therefore, prior to settlement of the derivative instruments, changes in the fair market value of those derivative instruments can cause significant increases or decreases in AOCI. For derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value must be reported in the current period, rather than in the period in which the forecasted transaction occurs. This may result in significant increases or decreases in current period net income. All hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the current period in net income. Income Taxes The Company is subject to income and other taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. For financial reporting purposes, the Company provides taxes at rates applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Estimates of amounts of income tax to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws, including the recently enacted American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on domestic taxes. The Companys balance sheet includes deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards. Ultimately, realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the future periods to absorb future deductible temporary differences or loss carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. As a result of managements assessment during 2004, the Company decreased the valuation allowances associated with certain foreign loss 27 carryforwards from $14.5 million at December 31, 2003 to zero December 31, 2004. The Company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in its reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration. As a result, the Company may determine that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be established. Any increases or decreases in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense. For a discussion of the effect on the Company of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, see Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements of this Form 10 K. Pension Plan The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans. The actuarial determination of the projected benefit obligation and related benefit expense requires that certain assumptions be made regarding such variables as expected return on plan assets, discount rates, rate of compensation increase, estimated employee turnover rates and retirement dates, lump sum election rates, mortality rate, retiree utilization rates for health care services and health care cost trend rates. The selection of assumptions requires considerable judgment concerning future events and has a significant impact on the amount of the obligation recorded on the Companys balance sheets and on the amount of expense included on the Companys statements of operations, as well as on funding. Noble Energy bases its determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had cumulative asset losses of approximately $2.2 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The Company utilizes the services of an outside actuarial firm to assist in the calculations of the projected benefit obligation and related costs. The Company and its actuaries use historical data and forecasts to determine assumptions. In selecting the assumption for expected long term rate of return on assets, the Company considers the average rate of earnings expected on the funds to be invested to provide for plan benefits. This includes considering the plans asset allocation, historical returns on these types of assets, the current economic environment and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan. It is assumed that the long term asset mix will be consistent with the target asset allocation of 70 percent equity and 30 percent fixed income, with a range of plus or minus 10 percent acceptable degree of variation in the plans asset allocation. The discount rate is determined by analyzing the interest rates implicit in current annuity contract prices and available yields on high quality fixed income securities. By definition, discount rates reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. A one percent decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would have increased 2004 benefit expense by $.8 million. The expected return assumption for 2005 is 8.5 percent and the assumed discount rate for 2005 is 6.0 percent. The expected return assumption was the same as 2004 and the assumed discount rate was 6.25 percent for 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview The Companys primary cash needs are to fund capital expenditures related to the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, to repay outstanding borrowings or to pay other contractual commitments, for interest payments on debt, to pay cash dividends on common stock and to fund contributions to the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Companys traditional sources of liquidity are its cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities. Funds may also be generated from occasional sales of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties. The Company made significant progress during 2003 and 2004 in improving liquidity and financial flexibility. Reduction in international capital 28 commitments due to completion of major capital intensive projects has increased flexibility and liquidity in 2004. With these projects completed or nearing completion, international capital commitments have declined while, at the same time, they have begun to contribute to the Companys financial and operating results. A new $400 million credit facility will also provide increased liquidity in 2005. The Company achieved a reduction in its ratio of debt to book capital (defined as the Companys total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus equity) to 38 percent at December 31, 2004, compared to 46 percent at December 31, 2003. The Company reduced outstanding debt by $48.7 million during 2004. The Companys current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was 1.10:1 at December 31, 2004, compared with ..73:1 at December 31, 2003. The improvement in the current ratio in 2004, as compared to 2003, resulted primarily from a $117.4 million increase in the year end balance of cash and cash equivalents, and a $153.7 million decrease in current installments of long term debt. In addition, the year end balance of accounts receivable trade increased by $103.5 million due primarily to increases of $59.2 million for gas sales at NEMI, $17.6 million for joint operations receivables, $13.0 million for crude oil and natural gas accruals in the U.S. and U.K. and $8.3 million for electricity sales in Ecuador. Cash Flows Operating Activities The Company reported a $105.4 million year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $708.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $602.8 million in 2003 and $507.0 million in 2002. The increases for 2004 and 2003 were driven by overall production increases, higher realized commodity prices and higher distributions from the Companys unconsolidated methanol subsidiary. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $588.1 million, $444.8 million and $577.5 million for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys investing activities relate primarily to expenditures made for the exploration and development of oil and gas properties. Expenditures were offset by the receipt of $62.5 million, $81.1 million and $20.4 million from sales of assets during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Financing Activities Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities totaled ($2.7) million, ($111.0) million and $12.8 million for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank or other long term debt, repayment of notes payable, the payment of cash dividends and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. During 2004, the Company had a net $48.7 million reduction in outstanding debt. In addition, the Company received $62.6 million from the exercise of stock options. Capital Expenditures Selected capital expenditures incurred in oil and gas activities, acquisitions and downstream projects consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Oil and gas mineral interests, equipment and facilities $ 501,119 $ 481,236 $ 505,464 Proved property acquisition costs 85,785 1,294 7,988 Unproved property acquisition costs 44,681 10,234 30,515 Downstream projects 970 45,134 57,646 Total capital expenditures during 2004 increased $133.5 million, or 25 percent, as compared with 2003. The increase included costs related to the acquisition of deepwater Gulf of Mexico interests and costs expended in further development of the Amistad gas field in Ecuador. Capital expenditures during 2003 declined $68.4 million or 11 29 percent from 2002. This decrease in spending was the result of declining capital commitments due to the completion, or near completion, of major capital intensive projects in international locations. Capital expenditures, as included in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the capital expenditures budget were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Capital expenditures from investing activities $ 660,851 $ 527,386 $ 595,739 Capital expenditures budget $ 750,000 $ 510,000 $ 519,000 Capital expenditures during 2004 were lower than budgeted amounts due to timing of capital outlays, which were delayed until 2005, for certain projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the United Kingdom, Israel and Phase 2B in Equatorial Guinea. Capital spending in excess of budget for 2003 was primarily due to the acceleration of the initial costs to begin the Phase 2B expansion in Equatorial Guinea. During 2002, additional capital expenditures were for the completion of the natural gas to power project in Ecuador and the continued development of the Israel project. 2005 Budget The Company has budgeted capital expenditures of $735.0 million for 2005. Approximately 30 percent of the 2005 capital budget has been allocated for exploration opportunities, and 70 percent has been dedicated to production, development and other projects. Domestic spending is budgeted at $485.0 million (66 percent of the worldwide 2005 capital budget), international expenditures are budgeted at $228.0 million (31 percent) and corporate expenditures are budgeted at $22.0 million (three percent). The 2005 budget does not include the impact of Noble Energys possible asset purchases or the previously announced proposed merger with Patina. The Company expects that its 2005 capital expenditure budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations. The Company will evaluate its level of capital spending throughout the year based upon drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations and property acquisitions. Discontinued Operations and Asset Sales During 2004, the Company completed an asset disposition program, including five domestic property packages that had first been announced during July 2003. The sales price for the five property packages totaled approximately $130 million before closing adjustments. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations and assets of the properties being sold as discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss from discontinued operations of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $59.2 million ($38.5 million, net of tax) non cash write down to market value for certain of the five property packages. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $62.5 million, $81.1 million and $20.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company believes the disposition of non strategic properties allows it to concentrate efforts on strategic properties and reduce leverage. Financing Activities Debt The Companys debt totaled $880.3 million at December 31, 2004, all of which was long term with maturities ranging from 2009 to 2097. 30 The Companys principal sources of liquidity are its credit facilities, including the following: A $400 million credit agreement due November 30, 2006 with certain commercial lending institutions which bears facility fees of 15 to 30 basis points per annum and interest rates based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 60 to 145 basis points per annum, depending upon the percentage of utilization and the Companys credit rating. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement. A $400 million five year credit facility due October 2009 with certain commercial lending institutions which bears facility fees of 10 to 25 basis points per annum and interest rates based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 30 to 112.5 basis points per annum, depending upon the percentage of utilization and the Companys credit rating. At December 31, 2004, there was $85.0 million borrowed against this credit agreement leaving $315.0 million of unused borrowing capacity. Financial covenants on each of the $400 million credit facilities include the following: (a) the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Exploration Expense (EBITDAX) to interest expense for any consecutive period of four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter may not be less than 4.0 to 1.0; (b) the total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, may not exceed 60 percent at any time; and (c) the Company may not incur any guaranteed liabilities in respect of any funded indebtedness of any unrestricted subsidiary in excess of $700 million in the aggregate for all such guaranteed liabilities. The Companys credit agreements are supplemented by short term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. The uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. Debt Issuances During April 2004, the Company closed an offering of $200 million senior unsecured notes receiving net proceeds of approximately $197.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses. The notes mature April 15, 2014 and pay interest semi annually at 5.25 percent. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit agreements and for general corporate purposes. During first quarter 2004, a subsidiary of the Company, Noble Energy Mediterranean, Ltd., entered into term loan agreements with several commercial lending institutions for a total of $150 million. The interest rates on the borrowings are based upon a Eurodollar rate plus an effective range of 60 to 130 basis points depending upon the Companys credit rating. The Term Loans expire in January 2009. Proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit agreements. Debt Repayments During 2004, the Company repaid the following: $125 million AMCCO Series A 2 Notes due December 2004. In connection with the repayment, the Company recognized a loss of $2.9 million ($1.9 million after tax), which is included in interest expense on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The repayment of the Notes was funded with borrowings under the Companys credit facility. $7.9 million on an acquisition note and $20.7 million of Israel debt. The Company made cash interest payments of $46.6 million, $46.0 million and $47.6 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends The Company paid quarterly cash dividends of four cents per share from 1989 through the third quarter 2003. For fourth quarter 2003 and for each quarter of 2004, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of five cents per common share. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. 31 Exercise of Stock Options The Company received $62.6 million, $24.7 million and $7.7 million from the exercise of stock options during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of stock options fluctuate primarily based on the price at which the Companys common stock trades on the NYSE in relation to the exercise price of the options issued. During 2004, the Companys stock reached higher sales prices than during 2003 or 2002, resulting in the exercise of more options and more proceeds to the Company. Other Contributions to Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company made contributions of $4.8 million to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans during 2004, $14.6 million during 2003 and $10.9 million during 2002. The Company expects to make cash contributions of $12.3 million to its pension plan during 2005. During 2004, the actual return on plan assets was a positive $7.9 million, while the returns in 2003 and 2002 were a positive $7.6 million and a negative $3.5 million, respectively. The value of the plan assets has tended to follow market performance. The expected return assumption for 2005 is 8.5 percent and the assumed discount rate for 2005 is 6.0 percent. The expected return assumption was the same as 2004. The assumed discount rate was 6.25 percent for 2004. The decrease in discount rate from 6.25 percent to 6.0 percent results in an increase in projected benefit obligation of $4.0 million. A one percent decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in an increase in benefit expense of $.8 million in 2004. Federal Income Taxes The Company made cash payments for federal income taxes of $112.3 million during 2004 and $55.5 million during 2003. During 2002, the Company received a federal tax refund of $40.4 million. The refund related to large estimated tax payments made during the first half of 2001 followed by a period of declining commodity prices, which resulted in lower taxable income by the end of 2001. Contingencies During 2004, no significant payments were made to settle any of the Companys legal proceedings. During 2003, the Company paid $1.9 million in settlement of two legal proceedings conducted in the ordinary course of business. During 2002, the Company paid $7.0 million in settlement of a legal proceeding conducted in the ordinary course of business. The Company regularly analyzes current information and accrues for probable liabilities on the disposition of certain matters, as necessary.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Debt of this Form 10 K. 32 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income and Revenues The Companys net income for 2004 was $328.7 million, an increase of over 300 percent compared to 2003 net income. Factors contributing to the increase included: A 57 percent, or $209.0 million, increase in crude oil sales due to a 26 percent increase in daily production and a 25 percent increase in average realized crude oil prices; A 27 percent, or $126.0 million, increase in natural gas sales due to a nine percent increase in daily production and a 15 percent increase in average realized natural gas prices; A 21 percent, or $31.8 million, decrease in exploration expense; and A 70 percent, or $28.5 million, increase in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Natural Gas Information Natural gas revenues increased 27 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a 15 percent increase in average realized natural gas prices and a nine percent increase in daily natural gas production. Natural gas revenues increased 35 percent in 2003, compared to 2002, due to a 43 percent increase in natural gas prices, offset by a one percent decrease in daily natural gas production. Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Natural gas sales $ 600,806 $ 474,762 $ 351,591 The table below depicts average daily natural gas production and prices from continuing operations by area for the last three years. 2004 2003 2002 Mcfpd Price per Mcf Mcfpd Price per Mcf Mcfpd Price per Mcf United States (1) 240,647 $ 6.00 260,560 $ 4.75 280,836 $ 3.24 Equatorial Guinea (2) 45,755 $ .25 39,906 $ .25 34,382 $ .25 North Sea 11,286 $ 4.73 13,861 $ 3.86 16,991 $ 3.14 Israel 48,015 $ 2.78 $ $ Other International (3) 21,262 $ .75 22,284 $ .41 8,799 $ .38 Total 366,965 $ 4.74 336,611 $ 4.13 341,008 $ 2.89 (1) Reflects reductions of $.08 per Mcf in 2004 and $.44 per Mcf in 2003, and an increase of $.05 per Mcf in 2002 from hedging in the United States. (2) Natural gas in Equatorial Guinea is under a contract for $.25 per MMBTU through 2026. (3) Ecuador natural gas volumes are included in Other International production, but are not included in natural gas sales revenues and average price. The natural gas to power project in Ecuador is 100 percent owned by Noble Energy and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. 33 Variances in natural gas production were attributable to the following: Natural decline rates for properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast region; Natural decline rates for properties in the United Kingdom section of the North Sea; Higher throughput and reduced downtime for the methanol plant in Equatorial Guinea; Commencement of natural gas sales in Israel in February 2004; and Ramp up of natural gas production in Ecuador, included in Other International, which began in September 2002. Crude Oil Information Crude oil revenues increased 57 percent during 2004, compared to 2003, due to a 25 percent increase in crude oil prices and a 26 percent increase in daily crude oil production. Crude oil revenues increased 42 percent during 2003, compared to 2002, due to a 14 percent increase in crude oil prices and a 24 percent increase in daily crude oil production. Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Crude oil sales $ 573,393 $ 364,382 $ 257,435 The table below depicts average daily crude oil production and prices from continuing operations by area for the last three years. 2004 2003 2002 Bopd Price per Bbl Bopd Price per Bbl Bopd Price per Bbl United States (1) 21,725 $ 31.90 16,084 $ 26.21 13,187 $ 23.29 Equatorial Guinea 10,084 $ 37.62 6,377 $ 27.93 5,259 $ 23.88 North Sea 6,718 $ 38.90 7,412 $ 29.95 7,847 $ 25.15 Other International 6,848 $ 34.00 6,141 $ 28.75 2,821 $ 26.58 Total 45,375 $ 34.53 36,014 $ 27.72 29,114 $ 24.22 (1) Reflects a reduction of $3.05 per Bbl in 2004, $1.01 per Bbl in 2003 and $.02 per Bbl in 2002 from hedging in the United States. Variances in crude oil production were attributable to the following: New crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico reflecting the success of the Companys deepwater and shelf projects, including Green Canyon 282 (Boris), South Timbalier 315/316 (Roaring Fork) and West Cameron 518; Natural production declines in the North Sea; Ramp up of the Phase 2A expansion project in the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea; and Increased production in China, included in Other International, due to the startup of the CDX field, located in South Bohai Bay off the coast of China, in January 2003. Electricity Sales Ecuador Integrated Power Project The Company, through its subsidiaries, EDC Ecuador Ltd. and MachalaPower Cia. Ltda., has a 100 percent ownership interest in an integrated natural gas to power project. The project includes the Amistad natural gas field, offshore Ecuador, which supplies fuel to the Machala Power Plant. The Machala Power Plant commenced commercial electricity generation in September 2002. 34 Operations data is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Operating income (in thousands) $ 10,839 $ 7,176 $ 2,311 Power production (total MW) 720,300 751,689 269,229 Average power price ($/Kwh) $ 0.081 $ 0.077 $ 0.068 The volume of natural gas and MW produced in Ecuador are related to thermal electricity demand in that country and typically decline at the onset of the rainy season. When Ecuador has sufficient rainfall to allow hydroelectric power producers to provide base load power, Noble Energy provides electricity to meet peak demand. As seasonal rains subside, the Company experiences increasing demand for thermal electricity. During 2004, the Machala Power Plant experienced lower power production due to normal seasonal weather variation and extended summer maintenance. Maintenance on one turbine took longer than expected after inspections uncovered damage that required repair work in the U.S. Full repairs have been completed. Income from Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Noble Energys income from unconsolidated subsidiaries consists of income from methanol operations. The Companys share of methanol operations was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (in thousands) $ 69,100 $ 40,626 $ 9,532 Methanol sales volumes (gallons in thousands) 146,821 122,015 105,126 Average realized price per gallon $ 0.69 $ 0.65 $ 0.43 Methanol production increased during 2004 as a result of higher throughput and reduced downtime. Dividends from unconsolidated subsidiaries contributed $57.8 million, $46.1 million and $17.7 million to the Companys net cash provided by operating activities during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. Such instruments include fixed price contracts, variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. Although these derivative instruments expose the Company to credit risk, the Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and believes that losses from nonperformance are unlikely to occur. Hedging gains and losses related to the Companys crude oil and natural gas production are recorded in oil and gas sales and royalties. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized a reduction of revenues of $61.3 million and $67.5 million, and an increase in revenues of $5.9 million, respectively, related to its cash flow hedges in oil and gas sales and royalties. Costs and Expenses Production Costs Production costs, from continuing operations, consisting of lease operating expense, workover expense, production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs increased $44.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was due to new operations in Israel, increased production from the ramp up of Phase 2A in Equatorial Guinea and new production in the Gulf of Mexico. Other factors affecting operations expense included increased service costs and workovers. 35 Production costs increased $38.7 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was due to several factors, including new operations in China, increased production and the startup of Phase 2A in Equatorial Guinea, new production in the Gulf of Mexico and higher production taxes. The table below includes the crude oil and natural gas production costs from continuing operations by area for the last three years.

Although production increased during 2004, unit rates decreased primarily due to increased low cost volumes in Equatorial Guinea and Israel. In 2004, DD&A expense includes $15.4 million of abandoned assets expense and $16.3 million of DD&A related to asset retirement obligations. 36 In 2003, DD&A expense from continuing operations increased $72.5 million compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher domestic DD&A rates and increased production volumes. Also, included in DD&A for 2003 is $20.6 million of abandoned assets expense and $20.2 million of DD&A related to asset retirement obligations, which increased DD&A by $1.26 per BOE as compared with 2002. The table below includes the DD&A from continuing operations for the years ended December 31: (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 United States $ 240,058 $ 254,041 $ 192,708 Equatorial Guinea 14,677 6,115 5,849 North Sea 18,244 28,219 28,279 Israel 9,058 40 31 Other International, Corporate and Other 26,818 20,928 10,014 Total DD&A expense $ 308,855 $ 309,343 $ 236,881 Unit rate of DD&A per BOE $ 7.92 $ 9.20 $ 7.55 Exploration Expense Crude oil and natural gas exploration expense consists of dry hole expense, unproved lease amortization, seismic, staff expense and other miscellaneous exploration expense, including lease rentals.

Exploration expense for 2003 included a pre tax charge of $20.2 million ($5.9 million after tax) to write off the Companys investment in Vietnam. Lower dry hole expense also contributed to lower overall exploration expense for 2004. Impairment of Operating Assets During 2004, the Company recorded $9.9 million of impairments, primarily related to downward reserve revisions on two domestic properties. In 2003, the Company recorded $31.9 million of impairments, primarily related to a reserve 37 revision on the East Cameron 338 field in the Gulf of Mexico after recompletion and remediation activities produced less than expected results. An analysis of the performance response of the field resulted in a reduction in proved reserves of 2.2 MMBoe. The Company recorded no operating asset impairments during 2002. Individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $6.6 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased $4.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in SG&A expenses for 2004 primarily reflects fees associated with the implementation of Sarbanes Oxley and increased salaries and bonuses. The increase in SG&A expenses for 2003 is due to increased corporate governance costs, professional fees and other costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance and increased salary expense. On a BOE basis, SG&A expenses were $1.52, $1.56 and $1.52 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gathering, Marketing and Processing NEMI markets the majority of the Companys domestic natural gas, as well as certain third party natural gas. NEMI sells natural gas directly to end users, natural gas marketers, industrial users, interstate and intrastate pipelines, power generators and local distribution companies. NEMI markets a portion of the Companys domestic crude oil, as well as certain third party crude oil. The Company records all of NEMIs sales, net of cost of goods sold, as GMP proceeds and NEMIs expenses as GMP. All intercompany sales and expenses have been eliminated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The GMP proceeds less expenses for NEMI are reflected in the table below. (in thousands, except margins) (amounts include inter company eliminations) 2004 2003 2002 Crude Oil Natural Gas Crude Oil Natural Gas Crude Oil Natural Gas Proceeds $ 20,610 $ 28,640 $ 31,867 $ 36,291 $ 26,824 $ 37,693 Expenses Transportation 12,086 20,269 21,456 28,844 20,323 29,000 General and administrative 43 5,301 182 8,632 802 3,857 Total expenses $ 12,129 $ 25,570 $ 21,638 $ 37,476 $ 21,125 $ 32,857 Gross margin $ 8,481 $ 3,070 $ 10,229 $ (1,185 ) $ 5,699 $ 4,836 Traded volumes Bbls/MMBTU 10,978 231,221 8,324 239,311 6,787 276,626 Margin per Bbl/MMBTU $ .77 $ .01 $ 1.23 $ (.01 ) $ .84 $ .02 NEMI employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to natural gas price risk. Most of the purchases made by NEMI are on an index basis; however, purchasers in the markets in which NEMI sells often require fixed or NYMEX related pricing. NEMI records gains and losses on derivative instruments using mark to market accounting. NEMI recorded a gain of less than $.1 million, a loss of $.2 million and a gain of $.9 million in GMP proceeds during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to derivative instruments. Interest Expense and Capitalized Interest Interest expense remained relatively constant at $61.6 million, $61.1 million and $64.0 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $13.4 million, $14.1 million and $16.3 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest is capitalized on the Companys development projects. The majority of the capitalized interest relates to long lead time projects in the deepwater and internationally, primarily Phase 2A and 2B in Equatorial Guinea. 38 Interest expense in 2004 includes $.5 million related to the reclassification of the deferred hedging loss from the settlement of an interest rate lock. The Company entered into the interest rate lock in late 2003 to protect against a rise in interest rates prior to the issuance of its $200 million senior unsecured notes in April 2004. At the time of the debt offering, the fair market value of the interest rate lock was a liability of $7.6 million ($4.9 million, net of tax). This amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and is being amortized into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the unsecured notes. Interest rates decreased during 2002 and 2003 while Company borrowings increased, peaking early in 2003. Throughout the remainder of 2003, the Company steadily paid down its debt resulting in a year over year decrease of $2.9 million in interest expense at December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 2002. Pension Expense The Company recognized net periodic benefit cost related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $9.1 million, $7.9 million and $8.5 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This expense included an expected return on pension plan assets of $6.7 million, $5.9 million and $5.5 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company is exposed to credit risk and takes reasonable steps to protect itself from nonperformance by its debtors, but is not able to predict sudden changes in its debtors creditworthiness. The Company periodically assesses its provision for bad debt allowance. The Company had allowances for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $13.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. During 2004, the allowance was increased by $5.4 million to reflect additional collection allowances resulting from higher power prices in Ecuador and $1.4 million due to various allowances related to the Companys domestic business. Other Expense/(Income) Other expense/(income) for 2004 includes a gain of $4.4 million ($2.9 million, net of tax) from a transaction in which the Company exchanged its interests in the Tweedsmuir development project and the producing Buchan and Hannay fields located in the North Sea for an interest in the currently producing MacCulloch field, also located in the North Sea. The Company expects to receive a total of $8.2 million in cash as part of the exchange. Income Taxes Income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to $202.2 million in 2004 from $51.7 million in 2003 due primarily to the increase in income. This increase in income tax expense was offset by the elimination of the Companys deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to China foreign loss carryforwards. The deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased from $14.5 million at December 31, 2003 to zero at December 31, 2004. Due to the positive results of development activities in China and projections of future taxable income, management now believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to the China foreign loss carryforward will be realized. The effective income tax rate increased to 39.2 percent in 2004 from 36.5 percent in 2003. This increase is primarily due to the tax benefit of the Vietnam write off in 2003, partially offset by the benefit of the release of the China valuation allowance in 2004 and the greater weighting toward domestic income in 2004. Income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to $51.7 million in 2003 from $19.8 million in 2002 primarily from the increase in income. However, the effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5 percent in 2003 from 70.9 percent in 2002. During 2003, the Companys income from international operations increased over 2002, but represented a smaller proportion of the Companys total income. Some of the countries in which the international operations were conducted have a higher statutory income tax rate than the United States. Also impacting the effective rate in 2003 was the realization of approximately $15.6 million of tax benefits for certain prior year costs incurred in Israel and Vietnam. 39 Discontinued Operations Summarized results of discontinued operations are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Oil and gas sales and royalties $ 12,575 $ 106,339 $ 91,576 Costs and Expenses: Write down to market value and realized (gain)/loss (14,996 ) 59,171 Oil and gas operations 4,709 27,731 28,468 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 28,762 48,405 Total costs and expenses (10,287 ) 115,664 76,873 Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes 22,862 (9,325 ) 14,703 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 8,002 (3,264 ) 5,146 Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations $ 14,860 $ (6,061 ) $ 9,557 Key Statistics: Daily Production Liquids (Bbls) 225 4,106 4,923 Natural Gas (Mcf) 4,429 32,823 46,615 Average Realized Price Liquids ($/Bbl) $ 33.96 $ 27.71 $ 22.57 Natural Gas ($/Mcf) $ 6.03 $ 5.41 $ 3.00 The long term debt of the Company is recorded at the consolidated level and is not reflected by each component. Thus, the Company has not allocated interest expense to the discontinued operations. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Tax The Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 and recognized a non cash pre tax charge of $9.0 million ($5.8 million, net of tax) in the first quarter of 2003 as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to adoption of this standard. FUTURE TRENDS On December 15, 2004, Noble Energy and Patina entered into the Merger Agreement under the terms of which Noble Energy has agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Patina. Total consideration for the shares of Patina is fixed at approximately $1.1 billion in cash and approximately 27 million shares of Noble Energy common stock, not including options and warrants exchanged in the transaction. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is conditioned upon, among other things: (1) approval by the stockholders of Noble Energy and Patina; (2) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals; and (3) the effectiveness of a registration statement relating to the shares of Noble Energy common stock to be issued in the proposed merger. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed early in the second quarter of 2005. There is no impact of the proposed merger on these financial statements. In connection with the proposed merger, the Company has received a $1.3 billion commitment from certain financial institutions. The new facility will be a reducing revolver due 2010 with a five percent per quarter commitment reduction in each calendar quarter during year four and 20 percent per quarter reduction in year five. The facility will incur a 7.5 basis point ticking fee from April 29, 2005 until the effective date of the facility. When the facility 40 becomes effective, the Company will incur a facility fee of 10 to 25 basis points per annum depending upon the Companys credit rating. The facility is to bear interest based upon a Eurodollar rate plus 30 to 100 basis points depending upon the Companys credit rating. The Company expects crude oil and natural gas production from continuing operations to increase in 2005 compared to 2004. The increased production is expected primarily from the continued expansion of natural gas markets in Israel, a full year of production from Phase 2A, the Phase 2B expansion of the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea and new deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The Companys production profile may be impacted by several factors, including: The timing of the production increases from Phase 2B in Equatorial Guinea and deepwater developments in the Gulf of Mexico during 2005; Seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect the Companys natural gas to power project; and Potential weather related shut ins in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas. The Company recently set its 2005 capital expenditures budget at approximately $735.0 million, excluding possible asset purchases or the previously announced proposed merger with Patina. The Company plans to fund such expenditures primarily from cash flows from operations. The Company believes that it has the capital structure to take advantage of strategic acquisitions, as they become available, through internally generated cash flows or available lines of credit and other borrowing opportunities. Management believes that the Company is well positioned with its balanced reserves of crude oil and natural gas and downstream projects. The uncertainty of commodity prices continues to affect the crude oil, natural gas and methanol industries. The Company periodically enters into crude oil and natural gas commodity hedges as a means to help reduce commodity price volatility. The Company cannot predict the extent to which its revenues will be affected by inflation, government regulation or changing prices. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Staff Position (FSP) FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, (FSP FAS 106 2). The adoption of FSP FAS 106 2 had no impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows because the Companys postretirement benefit plans, as currently structured, do not provide prescription drug benefits that qualify for the subsidy under the Act. Accounting for Costs Associated with Mineral Rights During 2003, a reporting issue arose regarding the application of certain provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to companies in the extractive industries, including oil and gas companies. The issue was whether SFAS No. 142 required registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as intangible assets on the balance sheet, apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs, and provided specific footnote disclosures. In September 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142 2, Application of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to Oil and Gas Producing Entities, (FSP FAS 142 2). FSP FAS 142 2 indicates that the scope exception in paragraph 8(b) of SFAS No. 142 includes the balance sheet classification and disclosures for drilling and mineral rights of oil and gas producing entities that are within the scope of SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies. The adoption of FSP FAS 142 2 had no effect on the Companys balance sheet, results of operations or cash flows as, historically, the Company has included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting crude oil and natural gas as a component of oil and gas properties in accordance with SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies. Accounting for Income Taxes On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) became law. The AJCA included numerous provisions that may materially affect accounting for income taxes. Those provisions include a repeal of an export tax benefit for U.S. based manufacturing activities and grants a special deduction that, 41 depending on the circumstances, could reduce the effective tax rate. In addition, the AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing for an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and, to date, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret some provisions of the AJCA. Two issues have arisen relating to accounting for the income tax effects of the AJCA: (1) whether the deduction on qualified production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction or a tax rate reduction under FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and (2) whether an enterprise should be allowed additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the AJCA was enacted to evaluate the effects of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of both current and prior years unremitted foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. In December 2004, the FASB issued two staff positions regarding these issues: FSP FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 stated that the staff believes that the qualified production activities deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The Company will account for any qualified production activities deduction as a special deduction in 2005 and believes that because of the phased in nature of the deduction, it will not have significant impact on its income tax provision or deferred tax assets or liabilities. FSP FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 stated that the staff believes that the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the AJCA and the timing of the enactment necessitate a practical exception to the SFAS No. 109 requirement to reflect in the period of enactment the effect of a new tax law. Accordingly, an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. The Company has begun an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision. However, due to uncertainty remaining as to how to interpret some provisions of the AJCA, the Company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. The Company is currently evaluating the possibility of repatriating earnings of its U.K. subsidiaries ranging in amount from $60 million to $125 million, with a respective tax liability ranging from $3.1 million to $6.6 million. The Company expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment by second quarter 2005. If management decides to repatriate a portion of its foreign earnings pursuant to the AJCA, the Company will reflect additional taxes on those earnings for the period in which that decision is made. Accounting for Nonmonetary Asset Exchanges In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS No. 153 requires that nonmonetary exchanges be accounted for at fair value, recognizing any gain or loss, if the transaction meets a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The provisions are to be applied prospectively, although earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 153 during third quarter 2005 for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring on or after July 1, 2005. Accounting for Stock Options In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) as of July 1, 2005, using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified prospective method, awards that are granted, modified or settled after the date of adoption will be measured in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to July 1, 2005 will be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123, except that the amounts will be recognized on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The Company is 42 currently evaluating the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and expects that it will recognize additional compensation expense for third quarter 2005. Accounting for Suspended Well Costs During 2004, an issue arose for companies using the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and production activities regarding the application of certain guidance in SFAS No. 19. Paragraph 19 of SFAS No. 19 requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If the well found proved reserves, the capitalized costs become part of the entitys wells, equipment and facilities; if, however, the well has not found proved reserves, the capitalized costs of drilling the wells are expensed, net of any salvage value. Questions have arisen in practice about the application of this guidance due to changes in oil and gas exploration processes and life cycles. The issue is whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future. In response, the FASB has issued a proposed Staff Position, FSP FAS 19 a, Accounting for Suspended Well Costs, to address this issue. FSP FAS 19 a proposes to amend the guidance for suspended wells to address circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future. For more information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs of this Form 10 K. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Derivative Instruments Held for Non Trading Purposes The Company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations. Management believes that the Company is well positioned with its mix of crude oil and natural gas reserves to take advantage of future price increases that may occur. However, the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, the Company has used derivative hedging instruments and may do so in the future as a means of managing its exposure to price changes. Such instruments include fixed price contracts, variable to fixed price swaps, costless collars and other contractual arrangements. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company entered into various crude oil and natural gas fixed price swaps and costless collars related to its crude oil and natural gas production. The tables below summarize the various transactions. Natural Gas 2004 2003 2002 Hedge MMBTUpd 120,284 190,038 170,274 Floor price range $3.75 $5.00 $3.25 $3.80 $2.00 $3.50 Ceiling price range $5.16 $9.65 $4.00 $5.25 $2.45 $5.10 Percent of daily production 33 % 56 % 50 % Gain (loss) per Mcf $(.08 ) $(.44 ) $.05 Crude Oil 2004 2003 2002 Hedge Bpd 16,261 15,793 5,247 Floor price range $24.00 $37.50 $23.00 $27.00 $23.00 $24.00 Ceiling price range $30.00 $54.00 $27.20 $35.05 $29.30 $30.10 Percent of daily production 36 % 44 % 18 % Loss per Bbl $(3.05 ) $(1.01 ) $(.02 ) During 2004, 2003 and 2002, no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Companys ineffectiveness related to its cash flow hedges was de minimis. 43 As of December 31, 2004, the Company had entered into costless collars related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows: Natural Gas Crude Oil Production Period MMBTUpd Average Price Per MMBTU Production Period Bopd Average Price Per Bbl Floor Ceiling Floor Ceiling 2005 79,932 $ 5.07 $ 7.82 2005 20,519 $ 31.56 $ 43.71 2006 3,699 $ 5.00 $ 8.00 2006 1,865 $ 29.00 $ 34.93 The contracts entitle the Company (floating price payor) to receive settlement from the counterparty (fixed price payor) for each calculation period in amounts, if any, by which the settlement price for the scheduled trading day applicable for each calculation period is less than the floor price. The Company would pay the counterparty if the settlement price for the scheduled trading day applicable for each calculation period is more than the ceiling price. The amount payable by the Company, if the floating price is above the ceiling price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the floating price over the ceiling price in respect of each calculation period. The amount payable by the counterparty, if the floating price is below the floor price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the floor price over the floating price in respect of each calculation period. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had entered into fixed price swaps related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows: Natural Gas Crude Oil Production Period MMBTUpd Average Price Per MMBTU Production Period Bopd Average Price Per Bbl 2005 53,699 $ 6.63 2005 6,443 $ 39.24 2006 130,000 $ 6.39 2006 10,600 $ 39.98 2007 130,000 $ 5.95 2007 11,100 $ 39.02 2008 130,000 $ 5.59 2008 10,500 $ 38.16 Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Company entered into fixed price swaps related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows: Natural Gas Crude Oil Production Period MMBTUpd Average Price Per MMBTU Production Period Bopd Average Price Per Bbl 2005 13,425 $ 6.50 2005 2,349 $ 40.66 2006 20,000 $ 6.40 2006 6,000 $ 41.33 2007 20,000 $ 5.98 2007 6,000 $ 39.50 2008 20,000 $ 5.65 2008 6,000 $ 38.35 The contracts entitle the Company (floating price payor) to receive settlement from the counterparty (fixed price payor) for each calculation period in amounts, if any, by which the settlement price for the scheduled trading day applicable for each calculation period is less than the fixed price. The Company would pay the counterparty if the settlement price for the scheduled trading day applicable for each calculation period is more than the fixed price. The amount payable by the Company, if the floating price is above the fixed price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the floating price over the fixed price in respect of each calculation period. The amount payable by the counterparty, if the floating price is below the fixed price, is the product of the notional quantity per calculation period and the excess, if any, of the fixed price over the floating price in respect of each calculation period. 44 In connection with the announcement of the Merger Agreement, in order to reduce the price sensitivity associated with future crude oil and natural gas prices, Noble Energy entered into additional derivative transactions (hedges), which are included in the tables above, using its own production that was available to be hedged. The natural gas hedges totaled 100,000 MMBTUpd starting in May 2005 through December 2005 and 150,000 MMBTUpd for 2006 through 2008. The crude oil hedges totaled 13,100 Bopd starting in May 2005 through December 2005 and approximately 16,700 Bopd for 2006 through 2008. These hedges consist of fixed price swaps that average $6.07 per MMBTU for natural gas and $39.30 per barrel of oil. Prior to closing of the proposed merger, Noble Energy may enter into additional derivative transactions using its existing production. The Merger Agreement provides that if Noble Energy terminates the Merger Agreement within three business days of receiving notification that the Patina Board of Directors has made an adverse recommendation change, or resolved to make such a change (in either case for any reason other than a superior proposal), Patina would be required to reimburse Noble Energy for up to $45.0 million of actual losses realized by Noble Energy with respect to certain hedges for the years 2006 through 2008. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had a net unrealized loss of $11.4 million related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments entered into for non trading purposes. Included in the net unrealized loss is $.7 million of ineffectiveness. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the balance in AOCI included net deferred losses of $6.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. The net deferred losses are net of deferred income tax benefit of $3.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively. If commodity prices were to stay the same as they were at December 31, 2004, approximately $22.3 million of deferred losses related to the fair values of crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments included in AOCI at December 31, 2004 would be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months as the forecasted transactions occur, and would be recorded as a reduction in oil and gas sales and royalties. Any actual increase or decrease in revenues will depend upon market conditions over the period during which the forecasted transactions occur. All current crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes In addition to the derivative instruments pertaining to the Companys production as described above, NEMI, from time to time, employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to natural gas price risk. Most of the purchases made by NEMI are on an index basis; however, purchasers in the markets in which NEMI sells often require fixed or NYMEX related pricing. NEMI may use a derivative to convert the fixed or NYMEX sale to an index basis thereby determining the margin and minimizing the risk of price volatility. NEMI records gains and losses on derivative instruments using mark to market accounting. Under this accounting method, the changes in the market value of outstanding financial instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change. NEMI recorded a gain of less than $.1 million, a loss of $.2 million and a gain of $.9 million in GMP proceeds during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2004, NEMI had a net receivable of $.6 million related to derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes. Receivables/Payables Related to Crude Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Instruments At December 31, 2004, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a receivable of $49.2 million (of which $28.7 million is current) and a payable of $60.0 million (of which $50.3 million is current) related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments. At December 31, 2003, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a receivable of $56.1 million (of which $48.1 million is current) and a payable of $67.2 million (of which $59.8 million is current) related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments. 45 Interest Rate Risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable and fixed interest rate debt. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $885.0 million of debt outstanding of which $650.0 million was fixed rate debt. The Company believes that anticipated near term changes in interest rates will not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt and will not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss. The remainder of the Companys debt at December 31, 2004 was variable rate debt and, therefore, exposes the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2004, $235.0 million of variable rate debt was outstanding. A 10 percent change in the floating interest rates applicable to the December 31, 2004 balance would result in a change in annual interest expense of $.7 million. The Company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate locks used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCI, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2004, AOCI included $4.6 million, net of tax, related to a settled interest rate lock. This amount is being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of the unsecured notes. Foreign Currency Risk The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivatives. The U.S. dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the Companys international operations. Transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars and recorded in the financial statements. Transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the Company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis. Transaction gains or losses are included in other expense/(income) on the statements of operations. Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Other Federal Securities Laws General. Noble Energy is including the following discussion to generally inform its existing and potential security holders of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect the Company and to take advantage of the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements afforded under federal securities laws. From time to time, the Companys management or persons acting on managements behalf make forward looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about the Company. These statements may include, but are not limited to, projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and the Companys future: (1) income, (2) crude oil and natural gas production, (3) crude oil and natural gas reserves and reserve replacement and (4) capital spending. Forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate, project, predict, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, goal or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Sometimes the Company will specifically describe a statement as being a forward looking statement. In addition, except for the historical information contained in this Form 10 K, the matters discussed in this Form 10 K are forward looking statements. These statements by their nature are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions and will be influenced by various factors. Should any of the assumptions underlying a forward looking statement prove incorrect, actual results could vary materially. Noble Energy believes the factors discussed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made herein or elsewhere by the Company or on its behalf. The factors listed below are not necessarily all of the important factors. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of forward looking statements. Noble Energy does not intend to update its description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises. The Company advises its stockholders that they should: (1) be aware that important factors not described below could affect the accuracy of our forward looking statements, and (2) use caution and common sense 46 when analyzing our forward looking statements in this document or elsewhere. All of such forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Volatility and Level of Hydrocarbon Commodity Prices. Historically, natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile. These prices rise and fall based on changes in market supply and demand fundamentals and changes in the political, regulatory and economic climates and other factors that affect commodities markets generally and are outside of Noble Energys control. Some of Noble Energys projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas and crude oil. These price assumptions are used for planning purposes. The Company expects its assumptions may change over time and that actual prices in the future may differ from our estimates. Any substantial or extended change in the actual prices of natural gas and or crude oil could have a material effect on: (1) the Companys financial position and results of operations, (2) the quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that the Company can economically produce, (3) the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to its properties, and (4) the Companys ability to fund its capital program. Production Rates and Reserve Replacement. Projecting future rates of crude oil and natural gas production is inherently imprecise. Producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs generally have declining production rates. Production rates depend on a number of factors, including geological, geophysical and engineering issues, weather, production curtailments or restrictions, prices for natural gas and crude oil, available transportation capacity, market demand and the political, economic and regulatory climates. Another factor affecting production rates is Noble Energys ability to replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through exploration success or acquisitions. Exploration success is difficult to predict, particularly over the short term, where results can vary widely from year to year. Moreover, the Companys ability to replace reserves over an extended period depends not only on the total volumes found, but also on the cost of finding and developing such reserves. Depending on the general price environment for natural gas and crude oil, Noble Energys finding and development costs may not justify the use of resources to explore for and develop such reserves. Reserve Estimates. Noble Energys forward looking statements are predicated, in part, on the Companys estimates of its crude oil and natural gas reserves. All of the reserve data in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by or on behalf of the Company are estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves. Projecting future rates of production and timing of future development expenditures is also inexact. Many factors beyond the Companys control affect these estimates. In addition, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Therefore, estimates made by different engineers may vary. The results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may also require a revision of that estimate, and these revisions may be material. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Laws and Regulations. Noble Energys forward looking statements are generally based on the assumption that the legal and regulatory environments will remain stable. Changes in the legal and or regulatory environments could have a material effect on the Companys future results of operations and financial condition. Noble Energys ability to economically produce and sell crude oil, natural gas, methanol and power is affected by a number of legal and regulatory factors, including federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and laws and regulations of foreign nations, affecting: (1) crude oil and natural gas production, (2) taxes applicable to the Company and or its production, (3) the amount of crude oil and natural gas available for sale, (4) the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities, and (5) the marketing of competitive fuels. The Companys operations are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and laws and regulations of foreign nations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Noble Energys forward looking statements are generally based upon the expectation that the Company will not be required, in the near future, to expend cash to comply with environmental laws and regulations that are material in relation to its total capital expenditures program. However, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, the Company is unable to accurately predict the ultimate financial impact of compliance. 47 Drilling and Operating Risks. Noble Energys drilling operations are subject to various risks common in the industry, including cratering, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids. In addition, a substantial amount of the Companys operations are currently offshore, domestically and internationally, and subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as loop currents, capsizing, collision, and damage or loss from severe weather. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents and adverse weather conditions. Competition. Competition in the industry is intense. Noble Energy actively competes for reserve acquisitions and exploration leases and licenses, for the labor and equipment required to operate and develop crude oil and natural gas properties and in the gathering and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, methanol and power. The Companys competitors include the major integrated oil companies, independent crude oil and natural gas concerns, individual producers, natural gas and crude oil marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers, many of whom have greater financial resources than the Company. Other. In the Companys exploration operations, losses may occur before any accumulation of crude oil or natural gas is found. If crude oil or natural gas is discovered, no assurance can be given that sufficient reserves will be developed to enable the Company to recover the costs incurred in obtaining the reserves or that reserves will be developed at a sufficient rate to replace reserves currently being produced and sold. The Companys international operations are also subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties including, among others, risk of war, terrorist acts and civil disturbances; expropriation or nationalization of assets; renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts; changes in taxation policies; laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign investment, taxation, trade and business conduct; foreign exchange restrictions; international monetary fluctuations; and other hazards arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the Company conducts operations. 48
