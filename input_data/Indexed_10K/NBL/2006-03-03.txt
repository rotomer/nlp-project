Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Noble Energy is an independent energy company engaged, directly or through its subsidiaries, in the exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas. The Company has exploration, exploitation and production operations domestically and internationally. Noble Energy operates throughout major basins in the United States including Colorados Wattenberg field, the Mid continent region of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the San Juan basin in New Mexico, 29 the Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. Noble Energy also operates internationally, in Equatorial Guinea, the Mediterranean Sea, Ecuador, the North Sea, China, Argentina and Suriname. The Companys accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Noble Energy is a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas. The Companys strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through the development of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is balanced between domestic and international projects. The Patina Merger allowed Noble Energy to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing its U.S. asset portfolio and has resulted in a company with assets and capabilities that include growing U.S. basins, coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties. After the Patina Merger Noble Energy has approximately 36% greater production than 2004 with a reserve base that is balanced between domestic and foreign sources. In addition, the Company has been reducing its investment in the Gulf of Mexicos conventional shallow shelf and shifting its domestic offshore exploration focus to Gulf of Mexico deepwater areas. Noble Energy is now a larger, more diversified company with greater opportunities for both domestic and international growth through high upside exploration drilling as well as lower risk exploitation projects. The Company had a successful year, both financially and operationally, in 2005. Financial highlights included the following: successful completion of the Patina Merger; record net income of $645.7 million, a 96% increase over 2004; diluted earnings per share of $4.12, a 48% increase over 2004; cash flow provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion, a 75% increase over 2004; and entry into a new $2.1 billion five year revolving credit facility. Significant operational highlights included the following: a 36% increase in daily equivalent production over 2004, including a 35% domestic increase and a 38% international increase; increases of 32% in the average realized crude oil price and 21% in the average realized natural gas price over 2004; increases in average realized methanol, LPG and Ecuador power prices; first production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico "Swordfish" development; "Belinda" discovery on Block "O" in Equatorial Guinea; completion and start up of Phase 2B (liquids expansion project) in Equatorial Guinea; sanctioning of the Dumbarton development in the North Sea; sanctioning of the Lorien development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration agreement with Samson Offshore Company signed in December; and impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Merger with Patina Oil & Gas Corporation On May 16, 2005, Noble Energy completed the Patina Merger in a transaction accounted for as a purchase of Patina by Noble Energy. Patina was an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas properties within the continental United States. Patinas properties and crude oil and natural gas reserves are principally located in relatively long lived fields with established production histories. The properties are primarily concentrated in the Wattenberg field of Colorados D J basin, the Mid continent region of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, and the San Juan basin in New Mexico. Noble Energy acquired the common stock of Patina for a total purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion, which was comprised primarily of cash and Noble Energy common stock, plus liabilities assumed. In exchange for Patinas common stock and options, Noble Energy issued 55.7 million shares of stock valued at $1.7 billion, issued options valued at $104.9 million, paid $1.1 billion in cash to Patina shareholders and assumed debt of 30 $610.5 million and deferred taxes of $1.1 billion. The consolidated operating and cash flow information includes financial results of Patina after May 16, 2005. Domestic Operations Domestic operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas in 2005, and a 35% overall increase in production. During 2005, Noble Energy drilled 644 gross domestic onshore and 22 gross domestic offshore wells. During 2006, the Companys North America (domestic) division continued to make progress on significant deepwater developments in the Gulf of Mexico that are expected to add substantial new production during 2006: Swordfish (Viosca Knoll Block 917, 961 and 962) Three subsea wells were tied back via dual flowlines to Kerr McGees Neptune spar in Viosca Knoll 826 and production began fourth quarter 2005 with a production volume of approximately 8,500 Boepd, net to the Company (60% working interest); Lorien (Green Canyon Block 199) A successful development well was drilled in 2005 and both the discovery well and development well were completed. Installation of subsea infrastructure to tie the wells back to a nearby host is currently underway, with production expected to commence in the first half of 2006 at an initial rate of approximately 12,000 Boepd, net to the Company (60% working interest); Ticonderoga (Green Canyon Block 768) A successful development well was drilled in 2005 and both the discovery well and development well were completed with a subsea tieback. Ticonderoga achieved first production on February 16, 2006 and has achieved peak production volumes of approximately 8,750 Bopd and 6,600 Mcfpd, net to Noble Energys 50% working interest. Impact of Gulf Coast Hurricanes In August 2005 Hurricane Katrina moved through the Gulf of Mexico and resulted in the loss of the Main Pass 306D platform. In September 2005 Hurricane Rita struck the Gulf Coast. Initial inspection of the Companys operated platforms indicated there was no additional major damage due to Hurricane Rita, although damage to third party processing and pipeline facilities slowed reinstatement of production from the Companys Gulf of Mexico assets. In addition, the hurricanes delayed efforts to restore sales of production from undamaged platforms at Main Pass 293/305/306 that were shut in by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. The Company estimates that 2005 production was reduced by approximately 6,700 Boepd due to the effects of the hurricanes. The loss of production is not covered by business interruption insurance. International Operations During 2005, international production volumes increased 38%, compared to 2004, primarily from increased production in Equatorial Guinea. International operations also benefited from higher realized commodity prices. In Equatorial Guinea, the Phase 2B liquids expansion project, which included increasing processing capacity, storage and offloading facilities at the existing LPG plant, has been completed and has increased LPG production by 1,622 Bbls per day and condensate production by 724 Bbls per day, net to Noble Energy, during 2005. In October 2005, Noble Energy announced successful results from its offshore Belinda exploration well on Block "O" in Equatorial Guinea. The Company is currently reviewing options for a multi well exploration and appraisal program, which is expected to begin in 2006. Noble Energy is the technical operator of Block "O" with a 45% participating interest. 2006 OUTLOOK In February 2006, Noble Energy announced that it had agreed to purchase the common stock of U.S. Exploration, a privately held corporation located in Billings, Montana, for $411.0 million. Subject to customary conditions, the transaction is scheduled to close on or before March 29, 2006. Prior to closing, U.S. Exploration will retire all company debt, terminate its commodity hedges and make all severance payments. Capital spending on the U.S. Exploration properties will be focused on accelerating production and reserve development. In 2006, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million. 31 Noble Energy has executed hedges on its own production volumes from March 2006 through 2010 that are equivalent to just over 50% of U.S. Explorations expected volumes. The hedges are in the form of collars. The average floors on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $6.23 per MMBtu and $58.74 per Bbl. The average ceilings on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $9.17 MMBtu and $72.52 per Bbl. The natural gas hedges are priced at the CIG index and thereby include basis differentials to Henry Hub. The Company expects crude oil and natural gas production from continuing operations to increase in 2006 compared to 2005. The expected year over year increase in production is impacted by several factors: a full year of production including assets acquired in the Patina Merger; the contribution of the Swordfish deepwater Gulf of Mexico development, which commenced production fourth quarter 2005; the start up of production from the Ticonderoga and Lorien deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments, which are expected to begin producing in the first and second quarters of 2006, respectively; and a full year of production from the Phase 2B liquids expansion project in Equatorial Guinea. Noble Energys production profile will be impacted by several factors, including: the timing and amount of initial production from Ticonderoga and Lorien; seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect the Companys natural gas to power project; potential weather related shut ins in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas; and downtime associated with plant maintenance or turnaround. 2006 Budget The Company has budgeted capital expenditures of $1.26 billion for 2006. Approximately 23% of the 2006 capital budget has been allocated to exploration opportunities and 77% has been allocated to production, development and other projects. Domestic spending is budgeted for $860 million (68% of the 2006 capital budget), international expenditures are budgeted for $380 million (30%) and corporate expenditures are budgeted for $20 million (2%). The 2006 budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases, including the previously announced pending purchase of U.S. Exploration as well as anticipated development costs associated with U.S. Exploration. The Company expects that its 2006 capital budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations. The Company will evaluate its level of capital spending throughout the year based upon drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations and property acquisitions. Accounting for Share Based Payments In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment." This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2006. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) as of January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified prospective transition method, awards that are granted, modified or settled after the date of adoption will be measured in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to January 1, 2006 will be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123, except that the amounts will be expensed in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the balance of deferred compensation relating to restricted stock in the Companys shareholders equity account will be reversed against capital in excess of par value in accordance with the transition requirements. Due to the complexity of developing a model to adequately value the Companys share based compensation awards, the Company has not yet quantified the impact of the new statement, but it is expected to increase compensation expense in 2006. 32 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. When alternatives exist among various accounting methods, the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts. The following is a discussion of the Companys accounting policies, estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in its application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Purchase Price Allocation As a result of the Patina Merger, in May 2005 the Company acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of Patina in a transaction accounted for as a purchase of Patina by the Company. In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of Patinas assets and liabilities the Company made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, the Company prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves. The Company estimated future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired, and estimated future operating and development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues were discounted using a market based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the merger. The market based weighted average cost of capital rate was subjected to additional project specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves were reduced by additional risk weighting factors. Estimated deferred taxes were based on available information concerning the tax basis of Patinas assets and liabilities and loss carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. While the estimates of fair value for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on Noble Energys cash flows, they can have an effect on the future results of operations. Generally, higher fair values assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties result in higher future depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, which results in a decrease in future net earnings. Also, a higher fair value assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties, based on higher future estimates of crude oil and natural gas prices, could increase the likelihood of an impairment in the event of lower commodity prices or higher operating costs than those originally used to determine fair value. An impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Certain data necessary to complete the Companys final purchase price allocation is not yet available, and includes, but is not limited to, final valuation of pre acquisition contingencies, final tax returns that provide the underlying tax bases of Patinas assets and liabilities at May 16, 2005, and final appraisals of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company expects to complete its valuation of assets and liabilities (including deferred taxes) for the purpose of allocation of the total purchase price amount to assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the twelve month period following the acquisition date. Any future change in the value of net assets up until the one year period has expired will be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in goodwill. Any change in deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the merger date (May 16, 2005) based on information that becomes available later will be recorded as an increase or decrease in goodwill. 33 Goodwill As of December 31, 2005 Noble Energy has $862.9 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the Patina Merger. The goodwill was assigned to the Companys domestic reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings but is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company conducted its goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2005. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. If the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be impaired, the amount of goodwill is reduced and a corresponding charge is made to earnings in the period in which the goodwill is determined to be impaired. The impairment assessment requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. The Company determines the fair value of its domestic reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates the fair value based on market multiples of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A")) and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, appropriate discount rates and other variables. Downward revisions of estimated reserve quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit, or sustained decreases in natural gas or crude oil prices could lead to an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods. Under the market approach, the Company makes certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums. Although the Company has based its fair value estimate on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ from the estimate. In 2005, no goodwill impairment was recognized. Reserves All of the reserve data in this Form 10 K are estimates. The Companys estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by the Companys engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the Companys DD&A expense. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, the Companys DD&A rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves could also trigger an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge which would reduce earnings. Oil and Gas Properties The Company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. The alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method. Under the successful efforts method, costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit of production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property by property basis as estimated by Company engineers. Application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals, during the periods the costs are incurred. Under the full cost method, these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of DD&A expense. In addition, under the full cost method capitalized costs are accumulated in pools on a country by country basis. DD&A is computed on a country by country basis, and capitalized costs are limited on the same basis through the application of a ceiling test. The Company believes the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use to account for its crude oil 34 and natural gas production activities because this method is better aligned with the Companys business strategy. If the Company had used the full cost method, its financial position and results of operations could have been significantly different. Exploratory Well Costs In accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting, the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well may be capitalized temporarily, or "suspended," pending a determination of whether commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas have been discovered. The Company will carry the costs of an exploratory well as an asset if the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its capitalization as a producing well and as long as the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. For certain capital intensive deepwater Gulf of Mexico or international projects, it may take the Company more than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability. The Companys ability to move forward on a project may be dependent on gaining access to transportation or processing facilities or obtaining permits and government or partner approval, the timing of which is beyond the Companys control. In such cases, exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the Company is actively pursuing access to necessary facilities and access to such permits and approvals and believes they will be obtained. Management assesses the status of its suspended exploratory well costs on a quarterly basis. These costs may be charged to exploration expense in future periods if the Company decides not to pursue additional exploratory or development activities. At December 31, 2005, the balance of property, plant and equipment included $35.2 million of suspended exploratory well costs, none of which had been capitalized for a period greater than one year. The wells relating to these suspended costs continue to be evaluated by various means including additional seismic work, drilling additional wells or evaluating the potential of the exploration wells. For more information, see "Note 5 Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs." Proved Oil and Gas Properties The Company assesses proved crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss as a result of a triggering event and when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than the current net book value. Estimated future cash flows are based on managements expectations for the future and include estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment. The Company recorded $5.4 million of impairments in 2005, primarily related to downward reserve revisions on certain domestic properties. Unproved Oil and Gas Properties The Company also performs periodic assessments of individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment. Cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon managements estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, future commodity prices and future costs to extract the reserves. Downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities, reductions in commodity prices, or increases in estimated costs could cause a reduction in the value of an unproved property and, therefore, could also cause a reduction in the carrying amounts of the property. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, indicating an impairment, the cash flows are discounted at a rate approximate to the Companys cost of capital and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. The estimated prices used in the cash flow analysis are determined by management based on forward price curves for the related commodities, adjusted for average historical location and quality differentials. Estimates of cash flows related to probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk weighting factors. Due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices, these cash flow estimates are inherently imprecise. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political climate in areas in which the Company operates also impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions. During 2005, the Company recorded impairments of significant unproved oil and gas properties totaling $3.1 million. 35 Asset Retirement Obligation The Companys asset retirement obligations ("ARO") consist of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO; estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements; the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used; and inflation rates. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, the Company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through DD&A. At December 31, 2005, the Companys balance sheet included a liability for ARO of $338.9 million, including $163.8 million resulting from hurricane damage. See "Note 6 Asset Retirement Obligations." Involuntary Conversions When an involuntary conversion occurs, such as the destruction of oil and gas producing assets by a hurricane, the Company accrues a loss by a charge to income if the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company recognizes an asset relating to insurance recovery only when realization of the claim for recovery of a loss recognized in the financial statements is deemed probable. The Company does not recognize a gain (a recovery of a loss not yet recognized in the financial statements or an amount recovered in excess of a loss recognized in the financial statements) until the insurance reimbursement has been received. Management of the Company must make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to these gain and loss accruals. These include estimated costs of salvage, clean up, restoration, redevelopment or abandonment and estimated amounts of insurance recoveries. The amount of an insurance recovery may be limited if total industry claims are in excess of the insurance providers ceiling limitation per event. A significant amount of time may be necessary for an insurance provider to review all related claims for an event and determine the Company specific claim limitation on the final recovery. In addition, the Company may continue to incur costs, submit claims and receive reimbursements over a multi year period. The estimates involved in this process can have significant effects on reported amounts of net income. A decrease in the estimated amount of insurance recoveries will result in a decrease in the involuntary conversion gain, which will result in a decrease in net income. An increase in estimated costs of salvage will result in an increase in the involuntary conversion loss, which will result in a decrease in net income. Unreimbursed losses will have a negative effect on the Companys cash flows. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses various derivative instruments to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations on forecasted sales of crude oil and natural gas production. The Company also uses derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to commodity price risk. In addition, the Company has used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties and the hedging counterparties creditworthiness. The Company accounts for its derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended". For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") until the hedged forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings. Therefore, prior to settlement of the derivative instruments, changes in the fair market value of those derivative instruments can cause significant increases or decreases in AOCI. For derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported in current period net income and therefore can result in significant increases or decreases in current period net income. All hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the current period in net income. Ineffectiveness is the amount of gains or losses from derivative instruments which are not offset by corresponding and opposite 36 gains or losses on the expected future transaction. Regression analysis is performed on initial assessment of the hedge and subsequently every quarter thereafter in order to determine that the hedge instrument will be or has been highly effective in offsetting gains or losses on the future transaction. Income Taxes The Company is subject to income and other taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. For financial reporting purposes, the Company provides taxes at rates applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Estimates of amounts of income tax to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws, including the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on domestic taxes, and estimates regarding the timing and amounts of future repatriation of earnings from controlled foreign corporations. The Companys balance sheet includes deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. Ultimately, realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the future periods to absorb future deductible temporary differences, loss carryforwards or credits. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. The Company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in its reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards, credits and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration. As a result, the Company may determine that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be established. Any increases or decreases in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense. Pension Plan The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans. The actuarial determination of the projected benefit obligation and related benefit expense requires that certain assumptions be made regarding such variables as expected return on plan assets, discount rates, rates of future compensation increases, estimated future employee turnover rates and retirement dates, distribution election rates, mortality rates, retiree utilization rates for health care services and health care cost trend rates. The selection of assumptions requires considerable judgment concerning future events and has a significant impact on the amount of the obligation recorded on the Companys balance sheets and on the amount of expense included on the Companys statements of operations, as well as on funding. Noble Energy bases its determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had cumulative asset losses of approximately $3.4 million, which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets. The Company utilizes the services of an outside actuarial firm to assist in the calculations of the projected benefit obligation and related costs. The Company and its actuaries use historical data and forecasts to determine assumptions regarding future events. In selecting the assumption for expected long term rate of return on assets, the Company considers the average rate of earnings expected on the funds to be invested to provide for plan benefits. This includes considering the plans asset allocation, historical returns on these types of assets, the current economic environment and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan. It is assumed that the long term asset mix will be consistent with the target asset allocation of 70% equity and 30% fixed income, with a range of plus or minus 10% acceptable degree of variation in the plans asset allocation. The discount rate is determined by analyzing the interest rates 37 implicit in current annuity contract prices and available yields on high quality fixed income securities. By definition, discount rates reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. A 1% decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would have increased 2005 benefit expense by $0.9 million. The expected return assumption for 2005 is 8.25%, and the assumed discount rate for 2005 is 6.00%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview The Companys primary cash needs are to fund capital expenditures related to the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, to repay outstanding borrowings or to pay other contractual commitments, for interest payments on debt, to pay cash dividends on common stock and to fund contributions to the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Companys traditional sources of liquidity are its cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities. Funds may also be generated from occasional sales of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties. A new $2.1 billion unsecured five year credit facility, with $820 million in remaining funds available at December 31, 2005, will provide increased liquidity in 2006. The Companys ratio of debt to book capital (defined as the Companys total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus equity) was 40% at December 31, 2005, compared to 38% at December 31, 2004. Significant changes in the Companys financial position causing a change in the ratio of debt to book capital include: increases in total debt related to the funding of the Patina Merger and additional capital expenditures; an increase in retained earnings from current year net income; an increase in capital in excess of par value from the issuance of stock in the Patina Merger; and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to an increase in deferred hedge losses. Cash Flows Operating Activities The Company reported a $531.7 million year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $708.2 million in 2004 and $602.8 million in 2003. The increases for 2005 and 2004 were driven by overall production increases, higher realized commodity prices and higher distributions from earnings of an equity method investee. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.9 billion, $588.1 million and $444.8 million for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys 2005 investing activities relate primarily to the Patina Merger as well as expenditures made for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties. Expenditures were offset by the receipt of $13.2 million, $62.5 million and $81.1 million from sales of assets during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities totaled $583.1 million, $(2.7) million and $(111.0) million for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank or other long term debt, repayment of notes payable, the payment of cash dividends and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. During 2005, the Company had a net $1.2 billion increase in outstanding debt primarily related to the Patina Merger. In addition, the Company received $67.7 million from the exercise of stock options. 38  Acquisition, Exploration and Development Related Expenditures Values preliminarily allocated to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties acquired in the Patina Merger were $2.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The Companys exploration and development related expenditure information (on an accrual basis) is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Exploration and Development Related Expenditures: Exploratory drilling and completion $ 41,739 $ 31,295 $ 67,665 Dry hole 98,015 46,192 63,637 Lease acquisition costs 16,793 44,685 10,234 Seismic 21,761 23,360 17,674 Total exploration expenditures 178,308 145,532 159,210 Development drilling and completion 662,585 399,217 325,990 Corporate and other 21,478 22,639 16,873 Total exploration and development related expenditures from consolidated operations $ 862,371 $ 567,388 $ 502,073 Companys share of equity method investees capital spending $ 27,639 $ 61,498 $ 41,944 Capital expenditures budget 962,000 750,000 510,000 Total capital expenditures during 2005 increased $261.1 million, or 42%, as compared with 2004. The increase includes $275.1 million of post merger exploration and development related expenditures on Patina properties. Capital expenditures during 2004 increased $84.9 million, or 16%, as compared with 2003. The increase included costs related to the acquisition of deepwater Gulf of Mexico interests and costs expended in further development of the Amistad gas field in Ecuador. Capital expenditures during 2005 were lower than budgeted amounts due to cost reductions and increased lead times for international capital outlays, offset by costs of an expanded domestic drilling program. Capital expenditures during 2004 were lower than budgeted amounts due to timing of capital outlays, which were delayed until 2005, for certain projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the United Kingdom, Israel and Phase 2B liquids expansion project in Equatorial Guinea. Capital spending in excess of budget for 2003 was primarily due to the acceleration of the initial costs to begin the Phase 2B liquids expansion project in Equatorial Guinea. Discontinued Operations and Asset Sales During 2004, the Company completed an asset disposition program, including five domestic property packages that had first been announced during July 2003. The sales price for the five property packages totaled $130 million. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods previously presented to reflect the operations of the properties being sold as discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss from discontinued operations of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $59.2 million ($38.5 million, net of tax) non cash write down to market value for certain of the five property packages. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $13.2 million, $62.5 million and $81.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company believes the disposition of non strategic properties allows it to concentrate efforts on strategic properties and reduce leverage. 39 Financing Activities Debt The Companys debt totaled $2.035 billion (excluding unamortized discount) at December 31, 2005, all of which was long term. Maturities range from 2009 to 2097. The Companys principal source of liquidity is a new $2.1 billion unsecured five year credit facility (the "New Facility") entered into in December 2005. The New Facility is available (a) to refinance existing indebtedness of the Company, and (b) for general corporate purposes. The New Facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and bears interest rates based upon a Eurodollar rate plus a range of 20.0 basis points to 95.0 basis points depending upon the Companys credit rating and utilization of the New Facility. The New Facility has facility fees that range from 7.5 basis points to 17.5 basis points depending upon the Companys credit rating. At December 31, 2005, $1.28 billion in borrowings were outstanding under the New Facility. The New Facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, the following financial covenants: (a) the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Exploration Expense to interest expense for any consecutive period of four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter may not be less than 4.0 to 1.0; and (b) the total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, may not exceed 60% at any time. A violation of these covenants will result in a default under the New Facility, which could permit the participating banks to restrict the Companys ability to access the New Facility and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the New Facility. At December 31, 2005, the ratios were 18.7 to 1.0 and 34.5%. The total debt to capitalization ratio for this purpose is calculated as the Companys total debt divided by the sum of debt plus equity, with increases or decreases thereto as provided by the New Facility. Upon acquisition of the New Facility, the Company repaid and terminated its existing credit facilities, which consisted of a $400 million credit agreement due October 2009, a $400 million credit agreement due November 2006, and a $1.3 billion acquisition facility due April 2010. The $1.3 billion acquisition facility was used by the Company to finance a portion of the cash consideration paid in the Patina Merger and the repayment of Patina debt. The Company also prepaid $45 million on its term loans due January 2009. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Debt Term Loans." The Company made cash interest payments of $92.5 million, $46.6 million and $46.0 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Dividends The Company paid quarterly cash dividends of two cents per share from 1989 through third quarter 2003. For fourth quarter 2003, for each quarter of 2004, and for the first two quarters of 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 2.5 cents per common share. In third quarter 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to five cents per common share. (The above amounts have been adjusted for the Companys two for one stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, in third quarter 2005.) The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of five cents per common share for fourth quarter 2005. On January 24, 2006, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of five cents per common share, payable February 21, 2006 to shareholders of record on February 6, 2006. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Exercise of Stock Options The Company received $67.7 million, $62.6 million and $24.7 million from the exercise of stock options during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of stock options fluctuate primarily based on the price at which the Companys common stock trades on the NYSE in relation to the exercise price of the options issued. Of the $67.7 million received from the exercise of stock options during 2005, approximately $43.5 million resulted from the exercise of Patina options that had been exchanged for Noble Energy options in the Patina Merger. 40 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2005, the material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into included operating lease agreements, drilling commitments, undrawn letters of credit, and derivative contracts. Other than the off balance sheet arrangements listed above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See "Contractual Obligations" below for more information regarding the Companys off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and or disclosed in the accompanying Notes.

The Company regularly analyzes current information and accrues for probable liabilities on the disposition of certain matters, as necessary. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income and Revenues The Companys net income for 2005 was $645.7 million, an increase of 96% compared to 2004 net income. Factors contributing to the change in net income included: the successful completion of the Patina Merger in May; a 36% overall increase in production, with 90% of the increase attributed to Patina properties; a 68%, or $381.4 million, increase in crude oil sales due to a 28% increase in consolidated daily production and a 32% increase in average realized crude oil prices; a 70%, or $420.1 million, increase in natural gas sales due to a 38% increase in daily production and a 21% increase in average realized natural gas prices; a 52%, or $61.4 million, increase in exploration expense; and a 16%, or $12.6 million, increase in income from equity method investees involved in the production and sale of condensate, LPG and methanol in Equatorial Guinea.

Natural gas revenues increased 25% in 2004, compared to 2003, due to a 14% increase in natural gas prices and a 9% increase in daily natural gas production. Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Natural gas sales $ 1,023,644 $ 603,571 $ 482,285 42 The table below depicts average daily natural gas production and prices from continuing operations by area for the last three years. 2005 2004 2003 Mcfpd $/Mcf Mcfpd $/Mcf Mcfpd $/Mcf United States (1) 343,953 $ 7.43 240,647 $ 6.03 260,560 $ 4.83 Equatorial Guinea (2) 65,581 0.25 45,755 0.25 39,906 0.25 North Sea 9,299 5.93 11,286 4.73 13,861 3.86 Israel 66,377 2.68 48,015 2.78 Ecuador (3) 22,795 20,875 21,485 Other International 190 1.10 387 0.75 799 0.41 Total 508,195 $ 5.78 366,965 $ 4.76 336,611 $ 4.19 (1)Reflects reductions of $0.77 per Mcf in 2005, $0.08 per Mcf in 2004 and $0.44 per Mcf in 2003 from hedging in the United States. (2)Natural gas in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 MMBtu through 2026 to a methanol plant and year to year to an LPG plant. Sales from the Alba field to these plants are based on a BTU equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. Both of these plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The volumes produced by the LPG plant are included in the table below under crude oil information. (3)The natural gas to power project in Ecuador is 100% owned by a subsidiary of Noble Energy and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales of $74.2 million, $58.6 million, and $58.0 million are included in total revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Factors contributing to the change in natural gas production included: additional domestic production (140 MMcfpd) from newly acquired Patina properties; increase in Phase 2A (Alba field expansion project) production and start up of Phase 2B (liquids expansion project) in Equatorial Guinea; higher production in Israel which commenced second quarter 2004; loss of production due to Gulf of Mexico hurricanes; natural field decline in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea; and increase in production in Ecuador. Crude Oil Information Crude oil revenues increased 68% during 2005, compared to 2004, due to a 32% increase in crude oil prices and a 28% increase in consolidated daily crude oil production. Crude oil revenues increased 58% during 2004, compared to 2003, due to a 25% increase in crude oil prices and a 27% increase in daily crude oil production. Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Crude oil sales $ 942,778 $ 561,404 $ 354,575 43 The table below depicts average daily crude oil production and prices from continuing operations by area for the last three years. 2005 2004 2003 Bopd $/Bbl Bopd $/Bbl Bopd $/Bbl United States (1) 25,941 $ 46.67 21,725 $ 32.64 16,084 $ 26.79 Equatorial Guinea (2) 17,786 42.51 9,190 38.16 5,464 28.34 North Sea 5,380 52.68 6,718 38.90 7,412 29.95 Other International (3) 7,851 42.37 6,848 31.06 6,141 26.67 Total Consolidated Operations 56,958 45.35 44,481 34.48 35,101 27.67 Equity Investee (4) 3,240 43.43 894 32.01 913 25.47 Total 60,198 $ 45.25 45,375 $ 34.44 36,014 $ 27.62 (1)Reflects reductions of $8.03 per Bbl in 2005, $3.05 per Bbl in 2004 and $1.01 per Bbl in 2003 from hedging activities.

Factors attributing to the change in crude oil production included: additional domestic production (12 Mbopd) from newly acquired Patina properties; increase in Phase 2A (Alba field expansion project) production and start up of Phase 2B (liquids expansion project) in Equatorial Guinea; new production from the Swordfish development in the Gulf of Mexico; loss of production due to Gulf of Mexico hurricanes; increase in production in China; and natural field decline in the North Sea. Gathering, Marketing and Processing NEMI, a wholly owned subsidiary, marketed approximately 55% of Noble Energys domestic natural gas production in 2005, as well as certain third party natural gas. NEMI sells natural gas directly to end users, natural gas marketers, industrial users, interstate and intrastate pipelines, power generators and local distribution companies. NEMI also markets certain third party crude oil. NEMIs gross margin from gathering, marketing and processing ("GMP") activities was as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Proceeds $ 55,261 $ 49,250 $ 68,158 Total expenses 28,067 37,699 59,114 Gross margin $ 27,194 $ 11,551 $ 9,044 NEMI employs derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to commodity price risk. Most of the purchases made by NEMI are on an index basis. However, purchasers in the markets in which NEMI sells often require fixed or NYMEX related pricing. NEMI records gains and losses on derivative instruments using mark to market accounting. The net loss related to these contracts totaled $1.5 million during 2005. Gains (losses) were de minimis for 2004 and 2003. GMP proceeds for 2005, includes a gain of $11.2 million for the sale of certain gas sales and transportation contractual assets. 44  Electricity Sales Ecuador Integrated Power Project The Company, through its subsidiaries, EDC Ecuador Ltd. and MachalaPower Cia. Ltda., has a 100% ownership interest in an integrated natural gas to power project. The project includes the Amistad natural gas field, offshore Ecuador, which supplies fuel to the Machala power plant. The Machala power plant commenced commercial electricity generation in September 2002. Operating data is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Operating income (in thousands) $ 21,091 $ 10,839 $ 7,176 Power production (MW) 799,160 720,300 751,689 Average power price ($/Kwh) $ 0.093 $ 0.081 $ 0.077 The volume of natural gas and electric power produced in Ecuador are related to thermal electricity demand in Ecuador which typically declines at the onset of the rainy season. When Ecuador has sufficient rainfall to allow hydroelectric power producers to provide base load power, Noble Energy provides electricity only to meet peak demand. As seasonal rains subside, the Company experiences increasing demand for thermal electricity. Electricity generation expense for 2005 and 2004 includes $11.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively, for net increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts. These increases have been made to cover potentially uncollectible balances related to the Ecuador power operations. Certain entities purchasing electricity in Ecuador have been slow to pay amounts due Noble Energy. The Company is pursuing various strategies to protect its interests including international arbitration and litigation. Income from Equity Method Investees Noble Energy owns a 45% interest in AMPCO, which owns and operates a methanol production facility and related facilities in Equatorial Guinea and a 28% interest in Alba Plant, which owns and operates an LPG processing plant. Noble Energy owns 50% interests in AMPCO Marketing, LLC and AMPCO Services, LLC, which provide technical and consulting services. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. The Companys share of operations of the equity method investees was as follows: Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Income from AMPCO LLC (in thousands) $ 54,982 $ 66,807 $ 38,235 Dividends from AMPCO (in thousands) $ 59,625 $ 57,825 $ 46,125 Income from Alba Plant LLC (in thousands) $ 33,916 $ 9,099 $ 4,560 Income from other equity method investees (in thousands) $ 1,914 $ 2,293 $ 2,391 Methanol sales volumes (gallons in thousands) 162,446 146,821 122,015 Methanol averaged realized price per gallon $ 0.77 $ 0.69 $ 0.65 Condensate sales volumes (barrels in thousands) 333 69 77 Condensate average realized price per barrel $ 55.76 $ 37.25 $ 28.32 LPG sales volumes (barrels in thousands) 850 259 256 LPG average realized price per barrel $ 38.63 $ 30.62 $ 24.61 The Company received a $31.4 million cash payment from Alba Plant, LLC on February 2, 2006. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. Such instruments include variable to fixed price swaps and costless collars. Although these derivative instruments expose the Company to credit risk, the 45 Company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and believes that losses from nonperformance are unlikely to occur. Hedging gains and losses related to the Companys crude oil and natural gas production are recorded in oil and gas sales and royalties. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized a reduction of revenues of $237.7 million, $61.3 million and $67.5 million related to its cash flow hedges in oil and gas sales and royalties. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk." Costs and Expenses Production Costs Production costs, from continuing operations, consisting of lease operating expense, workover expense, production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs increased $112.4 million, or 56%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was due to higher production volumes attributed to newly acquired Patina properties and to higher per unit production and ad valorem taxes. Production costs increased $39.3 million, or 24%, in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was due to new operations in Israel, increased production from the ramp up of Phase 2A in Equatorial Guinea and new production in the Gulf of Mexico. Other factors affecting operations expense included increased service costs and workovers. The table below includes the crude oil and natural gas production costs from continuing operations by area for the last three years.

In 2005, DD&A expense includes $11.3 million of abandoned assets expense and $14.2 million of DD&A related to capitalized asset retirement costs. The DD&A rate for 2005 has decreased primarily due to increasing low cost volumes in Equatorial Guinea and Israel. In 2004, DD&A expense from continuing operations remained flat versus 2003. Although production increased during 2004, unit rates decreased primarily due to increased low cost volumes in Equatorial Guinea and Israel. In 2004, DD&A expense includes $15.4 million of abandoned assets expense and $16.3 million of DD&A related to capitalized asset retirement costs. Included in DD&A for 2003 is $20.6 million of abandoned assets expense and $20.2 million of DD&A related to capitalized asset retirement costs.

Exploration expense increased $61.4 million, or 52%, during 2005 as compared with 2004. The increase was due to increased dry hole expense in the U.S. where a total of 36.8 net wells were classified as dry holes and expensed during the year. Exploration expense declined $31.8 million, or 21%, in 2004 compared with 2003. Costs related to 18.2 net wells were included in dry hole expense for 2004. Exploration expense for 2003 included a pre tax charge of $20.2 million ($5.9 million after tax) to write off the Companys investment in Vietnam. Lower dry hole expense also contributed to lower overall exploration expense for 2004. Costs related to 23.3 net wells were included in dry hole expense for 2003. Impairment of Operating Assets During 2005, the Company recorded $5.4 million of impairments, related to downward reserve revisions on four domestic properties. In 2004, the Company recorded $9.9 million of impairments, primarily related to downward reserve revisions on two domestic properties. In 2003, the Company recorded $31.9 million of impairments, primarily related to a reserve revision on a Gulf of Mexico property after recompletion and remediation activities produced less than expected results. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased $38.3 million, or 62%, in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased $6.9 million, or 13%, in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in SG&A expenses for 2005 reflects additional costs incurred relating to the combined operations of Noble Energy and Patina. The increase in SG&A expenses for 2004 primarily reflects fees associated with the implementation of 48 Sarbanes Oxley and increased salaries and bonuses. On a BOE basis, SG&A expenses were $1.94, $1.60 and $1.65 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest Expense and Capitalized Interest Interest expense totaled $96.2 million, $61.6 million and $61.1 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $8.7 million, $8.2 million and $13.4 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest is capitalized on the Companys development projects using an interest rate equivalent to the average rate paid on the Companys long term debt. Capitalized interest is included in the cost of oil and gas assets and amortized with other costs on a unit of production basis. The majority of the capitalized interest relates to long lead time projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and internationally, primarily Phase 2A in Equatorial Guinea. Interest expense includes $0.8 million in 2005 and $0.5 million in 2004 related to the reclassification of the deferred hedging loss from AOCI related to the settlement of an interest rate lock. The Company entered into the interest rate lock in late 2003 to protect against a rise in interest rates prior to the issuance of its $200 million senior unsecured notes in April 2004. At the time of the debt offering, the fair market value of the interest rate lock was a liability of $7.6 million ($4.9 million, net of tax). This amount is included in AOCI and is being amortized into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the Companys 51/4% Senior Notes due April 2014. Deferred Compensation Adjustment In connection with the Patina Merger, Noble Energy acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities related to a deferred compensation plan. The assets of the deferred compensation plan are held in a rabbi trust and include shares of Noble Energy common stock, which are classified as treasury stock. Increases or decreases in the market value of the deferred compensation liability, including the shares of Noble Energy common stock held by the rabbi trust, are included as deferred compensation adjustments in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded deferred compensation expense of $17.9 million from the date of the Patina Merger through December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, 69% of the market value of the assets in the rabbi trust related to Noble Energy common stock. Loss on Involuntary Conversion The net loss on involuntary conversion of assets for 2005 is equal to the amount of the Companys insurance deductible related to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina which primarily consisted of the destruction of the Main Pass 306D platform. Estimated salvage and clean up expenses are expected to cost $67.0 million. The Company has been notified by its insurance carrier that it should expect to recover no more than 50% of its total claim due to submission of total industry claims from Katrina damage in excess of a $1 billion ceiling limitation per event. However, the Company currently expects to recover sufficient insurance proceeds to cover the expected salvage and clean up costs and has offset anticipated insurance proceeds against the accrued salvage and clean up expense except for the $1.0 million deductible. The loss for 2004 is the insurance deductible related to infrastructure damage at Main Pass 293/305/306 caused by Hurricane Ivan. The Company expects to fully recover through insurance proceeds all salvage and clean up expenses and a portion of its redevelopment capital. Future additional expenditures for redevelopment will be capitalized as development costs, net of any remaining insurance proceeds. As of December 31, 2005, based upon work completed, Noble Energy has submitted $84.0 million (cumulative) in claims related to Hurricane Ivan damage, none of which has been disputed, and received $49.0 million (cumulative) in reimbursements. The Company received an additional $35.0 million in reimbursements in January 2006. In February 2006, the Company received insurance reimbursements of $6.4 million related to Hurricane Katrina damage. Noble Energy expects to continue to incur costs, submit claims and receive reimbursements in the normal course of business in 2006 and beyond. The Company will adjust the total loss attributable to the involuntary conversions in the period in which the contingencies related to the replacement costs are resolved. The Company does not recognize a gain until the insurance 49 reimbursement has been received. The loss of production is not covered by business interruption insurance. Pension Expense The Company recognized an actuarially computed net periodic benefit expense related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $11.0 million, $9.1 million and $7.9 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This expense reflects an expected return on pension plan assets of 8.25%, 8.5% and 8.5% during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company is exposed to credit risk and takes reasonable steps to protect itself from nonperformance by its debtors, but is not able to predict sudden changes in its debtors creditworthiness. The Company periodically assesses its provision for bad debt allowance. The Company had allowances for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $18.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively. During 2005, the allowance had a net increase of $5.6 million which included an increase of $11.3 million, net of collections, for Ecuador power operations, offset by $6.4 million in final write offs of allowances recorded in prior years. During 2004, the allowance was increased by $5.4 million to reflect additional collection allowances resulting from higher power prices in Ecuador and $1.4 million due to various allowances related to the Companys domestic business. Other Expense (Income), Net As a result of the impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the timing of the Companys forecasted production during the fourth quarter of 2005, derivative instruments hedging approximately 6,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 40,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas no longer qualified for hedge accounting. Accordingly, beginning October 1, 2005 the changes in fair value of these derivative contracts were recognized in the Companys results of operations, causing a mark to market gain of $20.0 million ($13.0 million, net of tax). In addition, the delay in the timing of the Companys production resulted in a loss of $51.8 million in fourth quarter 2005 ($33.7 million, net of tax) related to amounts previously recorded in AOCI. Both the gain and the loss are included in other expense (income), net on the statements of operations. Other expense (income), net for 2004 includes a gain of $4.4 million ($2.9 million, net of tax) from a transaction in which the Company exchanged its interests in the Tweedsmuir development project and the producing Buchan and Hannay fields located in the North Sea for an interest in the currently producing MacCulloch field, also located in the North Sea. The Company received a total of $8.2 million in cash as part of the exchange. Other expense (income), net for 2003 includes gains related to the sale of various domestic properties, excluding the properties included in discontinued operations. Income Taxes Income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to $322.9 million in 2005 from $199.2 million in 2004 due primarily to the increase in income. The effective income tax rate decreased to 33.3% in 2005 from 38.8% in 2004. This decrease is primarily due to the Companys ability to claim a foreign tax credit for the income taxes paid by its foreign branch operations, as well as to a benefit realized on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Income tax expense associated with continuing operations increased to $199.2 million in 2004 from $50.5 million in 2003 due primarily to the increase in income. This increase in income tax expense was offset by the elimination of the Companys deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to China foreign loss carryforwards. The effective income tax rate increased to 38.8% in 2004 from 36.0% in 2003. This increase is primarily due to the tax benefit of the Vietnam write off in 2003, partially offset by the benefit of the release of the China 50 valuation allowance in 2004 and the greater weighting toward domestic income in 2004 which is taxed at lower rates than income sourced from operations outside the U.S. See "Note 8 Income Taxes." Discontinued Operations Summarized results of discontinued operations are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 (in thousands) Oil and gas sales and royalties $ 12,575 $ 106,339 Write down to market value and realized gain (loss) 14,996 (59,171 ) Income (loss) before income taxes 22,862 (9,325 ) Key Statistics: Daily production Liquids (Bbls) 225 4,106 Natural Gas (Mcf) 4,429 32,823 Average realized price Liquids (Bbls) $ 33.96 $ 27.71 Natural Gas ($/Mcf) $ 6.03 $ 5.41 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Tax The Company adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" on January 1, 2003 and recognized a non cash pre tax charge of $9.0 million ($5.8 million, net of tax) in the first quarter of 2003 as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to adoption of this standard. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments Held for Non Trading Purposes The Company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations. Management believes that the Company is well positioned with its mix of crude oil and natural gas reserves to take advantage of future price increases that may occur. However, the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, the Company has used derivative hedging instruments and may do so in the future as a means of managing its exposure to price changes. Such instruments include variable to fixed price swaps and costless collars. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had open costless collar positions related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows: Natural Gas Crude Oil Average price per MMBtu Average price per Bbl Production Period MMBtupd Floor Ceiling Bopd Floor Ceiling 2006 (NYMEX) 3,699 $ 5.00 $ 8.00 1,865 $ 29.00 $ 34.93 2007 (Brent) 6,748 45.00 70.63 2008 (Brent) 4,077 45.00 66.52 2009 (Brent) 3,074 45.00 63.04 51 As of December 31, 2005, the Company had open fixed price swap positions related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows: Natural Gas Crude Oil Production Period MMBtupd Average Price per MMBtu Bopd Average price per Bbl 2006 (NYMEX)(1) 170,000 $ 6.49 16,600 $ 40.47 2007 (NYMEX) 170,000 6.04 17,100 39.19 2008 (NYMEX) 170,000 5.67 16,500 38.23 (1)Includes derivative instruments of 40,000 MMBtupd of natural gas and 6,000 Bopd of crude oil that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment at December 31, 2005. These derivative instruments were re designated as cash flow hedges in February 2006. The hedging instruments above represent 27% of the Companys expected worldwide natural gas production in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and 22% of the Companys expected worldwide crude oil production in 2006, 2007, and 2008. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had a net unrealized loss of $1.2 billion (pre tax) related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes. A net unrealized loss of $763.8, net of tax, is recorded in AOCI in the shareholders equity section of the Companys balance sheet and will be recognized in earnings as adjustments to revenue as the individual contracts are settled. In anticipation of the purchase of U.S. Exploration, expected to close on or before March 29, 2006, Noble Energy has executed hedges on its own production volumes. The hedges are for the period March 2006 through 2010 and are equivalent to just over 50% of U.S. Explorations expected volumes. The hedges are in the form of collars. The average floors on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $6.23 per MMBtu and $58.74 per Bbl. The average ceilings on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are $9.17 per MMBtu and $72.52 per Bbl. The natural gas hedges are priced at the CIG index and thereby include basis differentials to Henry Hub. The instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges. Derivative Instruments Held for Trading Purposes NEMI, from time to time, employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of production. While most of the purchases are made for an index based price, customers often require prices that are either fixed or related to NYMEX. In order to establish a fixed margin and mitigate the risk of price volatility, NEMI may convert a fixed or NYMEX sale to an index based sales price (such as purchasing a NYMEX futures contract at the Henry Hub with an adjoining basis swap at a physical location). Due to the size of such transactions and certain restraints imposed by contract and by Noble Energy guidelines, the Company believes it had no material market risk exposure from these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2005. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in earnings as incurred. Interest Rate Risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable and fixed interest rate debt. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $2.035 billion of debt outstanding of which $650 million was fixed rate debt. The Company believes that anticipated near term changes in interest rates will not have a material effect on the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt and will not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss. The remainder of the Companys debt at December 31, 2005 was variable rate debt and, therefore, exposes the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2005, $1.385 billion of variable rate debt was outstanding. A 10% change in the floating interest rates applicable to the December 31, 2005 balance would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $6.7 million. The Company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate "locks" used as cash flow hedges are 52 reported in AOCI, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At December 31, 2005, AOCI included $4.1 million, net of tax, related to a settled interest rate lock. This amount is being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of the Companys 51/4% Senior Notes due April 2014. Foreign Currency Risk The Company has not entered into foreign currency derivatives. The U.S. dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the Companys international operations. Transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars and recorded in the financial statements. Transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the Company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis. Transaction gains or losses are included in other expense (income), net on the statements of operations. 53
