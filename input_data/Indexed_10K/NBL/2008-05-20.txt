Business and Properties. This Annual Report on Form 10 K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward looking statements based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the date of this filing. These statements by their nature are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are influenced by various factors. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk FactorsDisclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements of this Form 10 K. General Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy, we or us) is a Delaware corporation, formed in 1969, that has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1980. We are an independent energy company that has been engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas since 1932. In this report, unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, information includes that of Noble Energy and its subsidiaries. Exploration activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling on properties for which we have exploration rights. We operate throughout major basins in the United States (US) including Colorados Wattenberg field and Piceance basin, the Mid continent area of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the San Juan basin in New Mexico, the Gulf Coast and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we conduct business internationally in China, Ecuador, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, West Africa (Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon) and in other areas. Strategy We are a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas. Our strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through the development of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is balanced between US and international projects. Strategic acquisitions (Patina Oil & Gas Corporation (Patina) in 2005 and U.S. Exploration Holdings, Inc. (U.S. Exploration) in 2006), along with additional capital investment have resulted in substantial growth in the last five years. Acquisitions and capital investment, combined with the sale of non core assets, have allowed us to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing our US asset portfolio, resulting in a company with assets and capabilities that include growing US basins coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties. Crude oil and natural gas sales volumes have doubled since 2003. Our reserve base, which includes both US and international sources at 58% US and 42% international, has almost doubled in the same period. We are now a larger, more diversified company with greater opportunities for both US and international growth. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data for additional financial and operating information for fiscal years 2003 2007. Proved Reserves As of December 31, 2007, we had estimated proved reserves of 3.3 Tcf of natural gas and 329 MMBbls of crude oil. On a combined basis, these proved reserves were equivalent to 880 MMBoe, an increase of 5% over the prior year. At December 31, 2007, 74% of reserves were proved developed reserves. 1 Proved reserves estimates at December 31, 2007 were as follows: December 31, 2007 Proved Proved Total Developed Undeveloped Proved Reserves Reserves Reserves United States Natural gas (Bcf) 1,259 581 1,840 Crude oil (MMBbls) 129 78 207 Total US (MMBoe) 339 175 514 International Natural gas (Bcf) 1,297 170 1,467 Crude oil (MMBbls) 100 22 122 Total International (MMBoe) 316 50 366 Worldwide Natural gas (Bcf) 2,556 751 3,307 Crude oil (MMBbls) 229 100 329 Total Worldwide (MMBoe) 655 225 880 Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. For additional information regarding estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves, including estimates of proved and proved developed reserves, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and the changes in discounted future net cash flows, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataSupplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesReserves. Engineers in our Houston, Denver and London offices prepare all reserve estimates for our different geographical regions. These reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by senior engineering staff and division management with final approval by the Director of Asset Development and certain members of senior management. During each of the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we retained Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), independent third party reserve engineers, to perform reserve audits of proved reserves. A reserve audit, as we use the term, is a process involving an independent third party engineering firms visits, collection of any and all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firms complete external preparation of reserve estimates. Our use of the term reserve audit is intended only to refer to the collective application of the procedures which NSAI was engaged to perform. The term reserve audit may be defined and used differently by other companies. The reserve audit for 2007 included a detailed review of 16 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and US fields, which covered approximately 71% of US proved reserves and 96% of international proved reserves (81% of total proved reserves). The reserve audit for 2006 included a detailed review of 14 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and US fields, which covered approximately 80% of our total proved reserves. The reserve audit for 2005 included a detailed review of 11 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and US fields, which covered approximately 72% of our total proved reserves. In connection with the 2007 reserve audit, NSAI prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, NSAI examined our estimates with respect to reserve quantities, future producing rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI also examined our estimates with respect to reserve categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Regulation S X Rule 4 10(a) and subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff interpretations and guidance. In the conduct of the reserve audit, NSAI did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of NSAI which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. NSAI determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of reasonable certainty, as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4 10(a)(2) of Regulation S X. NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at December 31, 2007, based upon its evaluation. Its opinion concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. 2 The fields that NSAI audits include our most significant fields and are chosen by senior engineering staff and division management with final approval by the Director of Asset Development and certain members of senior management. We usually include all deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, all international fields that require reports by requirement of the host government, all fields that require sanctioning by our Board of Directors, and other major fields. No significant fields were excluded from the December 31, 2007 reserve audit. When compared on a field by field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of NSAI. Given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected. On a quantity basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 21,966 MBoe above to 16,882 MBoe below as compared with our estimates. On a percentage basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 9% above our estimates to 42% below our estimates. Differences between our estimates and those of NSAI are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 10%. At December 31, 2007, reserves differences, in the aggregate, were less than 13,200 MBoe, or 2%. Since January 1, 2007, no crude oil or natural gas reserve information has been filed with, or included in any report to any federal authority or agency other than the SEC and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US Department of Energy. We file Form 23, including reserve and other information, with the EIA. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We maintain an ongoing portfolio optimization program. We may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the assets. We may also divest non core assets in order to optimize our property portfolio. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective July 1, 2007. We expect the sale, which is subject to regulatory and partner approvals, to close in 2008. Crude oil reserves for the Argentina properties totaled 7 MMBbls at December 31, 2007. In 2006, we sold all of our Gulf of Mexico shelf properties except for the Main Pass area, which is undergoing redevelopment studies. As of the effective date of the sale, proved reserves for the Gulf of Mexico properties sold totaled approximately 7 MMBbls of crude oil and 110 Bcf of natural gas. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast onshore areas remain core areas and are more aligned with our long term business strategies. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3Acquisitions and Divestitures. In 2006, we acquired U.S. Exploration, a privately held corporation, for $412 million plus liabilities assumed. U.S. Explorations reserves and production are located in Colorados Wattenberg field. This acquisition significantly expanded our operations in one of our core areas. Proved reserves of U.S. Exploration at the time of acquisition were approximately 234 Bcfe, of which 38% of the reserves were proved developed and 55% of the reserves were natural gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $413 million and unproved properties were valued at $131 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3Acquisitions and Divestitures. In 2005, we acquired Patina through merger (Patina Merger) for a total purchase price of $4.9 billion. Patinas long lived crude oil and natural gas reserves provide a significant inventory of low risk opportunities that balanced our portfolio. Patinas proved reserves at the time of acquisition were estimated to be approximately 1.6 Tcfe, of which 72% of the reserves were proved developed and 67% of the reserves were natural gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $2.6 billion and unproved properties were valued at $1.1 billion. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3Acquisitions and Divestitures. 3 Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Activities We search for crude oil and natural gas properties, seek to acquire exploration rights in areas of interest and conduct exploratory activities. These activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling, where appropriate, on properties for which we have acquired exploration rights. Our properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases. We also own natural gas processing plants and natural gas gathering and other crude oil and natural gas related pipeline systems. United States We have been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities throughout onshore US since 1932 and in the Gulf of Mexico since 1968. The Patina Merger and the acquisition of U.S. Exploration have significantly increased the breadth of our onshore operations, especially in the Rocky Mountain and Mid continent areas. These two acquisitions have provided us with a multi year inventory of exploitation and development opportunities. In 2007, we continued to expand our acreage position with the acquisition of approximately 290,000 net acres in the Piceance, Niobrara, and New Albany Shale areas. US operations accounted for 58% of our 2007 consolidated sales volumes and 58% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2007. Approximately 60% of the proved reserves are natural gas and 40% are crude oil. Our onshore US portfolio at December 31, 2007 included 1,308,823 gross developed acres and 1,234,858 gross undeveloped acres. We also hold interests in 97 offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $1.2 billion, or 74%, of budgeted capital in the US. Sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our significant US operating areas were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Sales Volumes Proved Reserves Natural Gas Crude Oil Total Natural Gas Crude Oil Total (MMcf) (MBbls) (MBoe) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe) Northern Region Wattenberg 59,670 4,674 14,619 893 109 258 Piceance 7,797 7 1,307 183 31 Niobrara 7,897 1,316 98 16 Other 9,392 53 1,618 139 1 24 Total 84,756 4,734 18,860 1,313 110 329 Southern Region Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 18,722 5,847 8,967 79 21 34 Mid continent 30,760 3,340 8,467 341 51 108 Gulf Coast onshore and other 16,219 1,530 4,233 107 25 43 Total 65,701 10,717 21,667 527 97 185 Total United States 150,457 15,451 40,527 1,840 207 514 4 Additional information for our significant US operating areas is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Gross Wells Drilled/ Gross Participated in Productive Wells Northern Region Wattenberg 508 5,161 Piceance 55 112 Niobrara 125 744 Other 56 1,239 Total 744 7,256 Southern Region Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 6 13 Mid continent 147 3,981 Gulf Coast onshore and other 38 457 Total 191 4,451 Total United States 935 11,707 Northern RegionThe Northern region consists of our operations in the Rocky Mountain area, which includes the D J (Wattenberg field), San Juan, Wind River, and Piceance basins, as well as the Niobrara, Bowdoin and Siberia Ridge fields. The addition of Patina and U.S. Exploration assets, particularly in the Wattenberg field, combined with our legacy operations in the Bowdoin field, the Niobrara trend, the Wind River basin and Piceance basin, have made the Rocky Mountains one of our core operating areas. We are currently running 13 drilling rigs and 24 completion/workover units. We plan to invest approximately $744 million, or 62% of budgeted US capital in the Northern region during 2008. Wattenberg FieldThe Wattenberg field (approximately 97% operated working interest), our largest US asset, continues to grow production and reserves. In 2007, sales of production from this field accounted for 36% of total US sales volumes. Wattenberg field proved reserves accounted for 50% of US proved reserves at December 31, 2007. We acquired working interests in the Wattenberg field through the Patina Merger in 2005 and acquisition of U.S. Exploration in 2006. Located in the D J basin of north central Colorado, the Wattenberg field provides us with a substantial future project inventory. One of the most attractive features of the field is the presence of multiple productive formations, which include the Codell, Niobrara and J Sand formations, as well as the D Sand, Dakota and the shallower Shannon, Sussex and Parkman formations. Drilling in the Wattenberg field is considered lower risk from the perspective of finding crude oil and natural gas reserves, with 99.8% of the wells drilled in 2007 encountering sufficient quantities of reserves to be completed as economic producers. In May 1998, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) adopted the Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A which allows all formations in the Wattenberg field to be drilled, produced and commingled from any or all of ten potential drilling locations on a 320 acre parcel. A commingled well is one which produces crude oil from two or more formations or zones through a common string of casing and tubing. In December 2005, the COGCC amended Rule 318A providing for an effective well density of one well per 20 acres in a designated portion of the Greater Wattenberg Area to more effectively drain the reservoir. The amendment applies only to the Niobrara, Codell and J Sand formations and became effective in March 2006. We are currently running seven drilling rigs and 17 completion units in the Wattenberg field. Our current field activities are focused primarily on the development of J Sand, Codell and Niobrara reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores, recompleting the Codell formation within existing J Sand wells, refracturing or trifracturing existing Codell wells and refracturing or recompleting the Niobrara formation within existing Codell wells. A refracture consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves. A trifracture is effectively a refracture of a refracture. These projects and continued success with our production enhancement program, which includes well workovers, reactivations, and commingling of zones, allow us to increase production and add proved reserves to what is considered a mature field. During 2007, we drilled or participated in 508 development wells, with a 99.8% success rate, and added approximately 244 Bcfe of proved reserves in the Wattenberg field. Approximately 58% of these reserve additions were natural gas. We also grew production from an average of 227 MMcfe per day for 2006 to 240 MMcfe per day for 2007. We plan to drill approximately 480 wells in 2008 (of which 337 will be combination Codell/Niobrara new drills). We also plan to participate in 120 non operated drilling projects in 2008. We have a substantial project inventory remaining and plan to perform approximately 340 projects including refractures, trifractures, and recompletions during 2008. 5 Other Rocky Mountain areas include: Niobrara TrendThe Niobrara trend (approximately 87% operated working interest) is located in eastern Colorado and extends into Kansas and Nebraska. During 2007, we expanded our acreage position with the acquisition of 160,000 net acres. We are currently running two drilling rigs and three completion units. During 2007, we drilled or participated in 125 wells with a 79% success rate, and our activity resulted in the addition of 19 Bcfe of proved reserves. We plan to drill 300 wells in 2008. Piceance BasinThe Piceance basin in western Colorado (approximately 96% operated working interest) is another rapidly growing area for us. During 2007, we added 10,500 net acres to our position. We are currently running four drilling rigs and three completion units. We drilled or participated in 55 development wells during 2007, 100% of which were successful, and our activity resulted in the addition of 83 Bcfe of proved reserves. We plan to drill over 100 wells during 2008. OtherWe are also active in the Bowdoin field (approximately 60% operated working interest), located in north central Montana; the San Juan basin (approximately 81% operated working interest), located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado; and the Wind River basin (approximately 56% operated working interest), located in central Wyoming. During 2007 we drilled or participated in a total of 56 development wells in these areas, 100% of which were successful. We plan to drill approximately 60 wells and recomplete 190 wells during 2008. Southern RegionThe Southern region includes the Gulf Coast onshore, West and East Texas, Louisiana, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Mid continent area (the Texas Panhandle and parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Illinois and Indiana). The Gulf Coast and deepwater Gulf of Mexico are core US operating areas. During 2006, we sold all of our Gulf of Mexico shelf properties except for the Main Pass area. The sale of our shelf properties allows us to migrate future investments and growth from the Gulf of Mexico shelf to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which we believe is an area of higher potential. We plan to invest approximately $460 million, or 38% of budgeted US capital, in the Southern region during 2008, with approximately 67% in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the remainder to the Gulf Coast and the Mid continent areas. Deepwater Gulf of MexicoDeepwater Gulf of Mexico accounted for 22% of 2007 US sales volumes and 7% of US proved reserves at December 31, 2007. During 2007, we continued to focus on the growth of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico business highlighted by a successful exploration discovery at Isabela and a successful sidetrack appraisal well at our 2006 Raton discovery. We also completed successful development drilling programs in our Ticonderoga and Swordfish fields. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity resulted in proved reserve additions of 12 MMBoe during 2007. Participation in the 2007 Central Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Sale resulted in our being awarded eight new deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases totaling $50 million. At year end, development planning was underway for Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562, 33% working interest). We have also acquired an interest in adjacent acreage with additional exploration potential on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 519 and 563 (23.25% working interest). We plan to drill a well on Block 519 (Santa Cruz Prospect) in 2008 pending rig availability. In total there are three prospects on the combined leasehold that, conceptually, would be co developed in a subsea tieback to an existing production facility. Other 2007 exploration drilling included the Mississippi Canyon Block 568 #1 (Robusto Prospect, 20% working interest) and the East Breaks Block 465 #1 (Lost Ark South Prospect, 98.4% working interest), neither of which encountered hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. During 2007 we saw an extremely active deepwater Gulf of Mexico development program. At our Raton project in Mississippi Canyon Block 248 (66.67% operated working interest), we successfully sidetracked and completed the 248 #1 discovery well drilled in 2006. At year end the project had moved into the development stage and is slated for subsea tieback and first production in the second quarter of 2008. At our operated Swordfish project (85% working interest), we drilled and completed a sidetrack to Viosca Knoll Block 917 #1 well and began gas production from this well at year end. At the Ticonderoga development in Green Canyon Block 768 (50% working interest, non operated), the #3 and #1 ST4 wells were drilled and completed to extend and enhance production from the field. Both are slated for first production in the first quarter of 2008. 6 At the Lost Ark project in East Breaks Blocks 421 and 464 (48.4% operated working interest), the 421 #1 well, which had reached the end of its productive life, was plugged and abandoned, and the 464 #1 well was completed and put on production to develop the remaining reserves at the field. We are currently evaluating a possible sidetrack appraisal well to be drilled at the Raton South oil discovery in Mississippi Canyon Block 292 during late 2008 (originally drilled in 2006). The Redrock natural gas/condensate discovery, also drilled in 2006, is currently considered a co development candidate to a successful sidetrack appraisal well at Raton South. Additional key exploration activity planned for 2008 includes a well at the Mississippi Canyon Block 948, Gunflint prospect, (50% working interest), in the second half of 2008. Mid continentA significant area of activity in Mid continent is the Granite Wash development, located in the Texas Panhandle. We drilled or participated in 53 development wells in 2007, 100% of which were successful. The potential for horizontal drilling is currently being evaluated. Another significant area in Mid continent is the ongoing Southern Oklahoma development. In 2007 we drilled or participated in 45 wells resulting in additional incremental production of 1,515 Boepd. In addition, we continue to selectively increase our acreage position in resource plays, including shale plays. We have accumulated over 179,000 acres in the New Albany Shale. During 2007, we drilled 16 New Albany Shale wells. Currently nine are producing and seven are in the progress of pipeline connection. The Paxton facility, which we operate, will serve the majority of wells in the Paxton field. We plan to have an active drilling program during 2008. Other Mid continent areas include parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana and Arkansas. During 2007, we drilled or participated in a total of 33 wells. We plan to drill or participate in 60 wells in the Mid continent area during 2008. Gulf Coast OnshoreDuring late 2007, we began a six well program at Oliver Creek in Shelby County, Texas to develop the Travis Peak reservoir as well as test deeper Cotton Valley horizons. We have completed one Travis Peak well and are currently completing the second Travis Peak well. The deeper Cotton Valley horizons are being tested in two additional wells currently being drilled or completed. Two additional wells remain in the current six well program. Additional drilling is planned for later in 2008. International International operations are significant to our business, accounting for 42% of consolidated sales volumes in 2007 and 42% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2007. International proved reserves are approximately 67% natural gas and 33% crude oil. Operations in Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Ecuador, China and Suriname are conducted in accordance with the terms of production sharing contracts. In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $392 million, or 24%, of budgeted capital in our international locations. 7 Additional information for our significant international operating areas is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Sales Volumes Proved Reserves Natural Gas Crude Oil Total Natural Gas Crude Oil Total (MMcf) (MBbls) (MBoe) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe) International West Africa 48,349 5,500 13,558 941 82 239 North Sea 2,276 4,564 4,943 19 25 28 Israel 40,449 6,742 319 53 Ecuador 9,385 1,564 188 31 China 1,402 1,402 8 8 Argentina 1,034 1,034 7 7 Total consolidated 100,459 12,500 29,243 1,467 122 366 Equity investees: Condensate (MBbls) 670 670 LPG (MBbls) 2,135 2,135 Total 100,459 15,305 32,048 Equity investee share of methanol sales (Kgal) 160,540 Wells drilled in 2007 and productive wells at December 31, 2007 in our international operating areas were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Gross Wells Gross Drilled/Participated in Productive Wells International West Africa 7 20 North Sea 2 22 Israel 1 8 Ecuador 5 China 16 Argentina 50 732 Total International 60 803 West Africa (Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon)Operations in West Africa accounted for 46% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 65% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 45,203 gross developed acres and 850,197 gross undeveloped acres in Equatorial Guinea and 1,125,000 gross undeveloped acres in Cameroon. We began investing in West Africa in the early 1990s. Activities center around our 34% non operated working interest in the Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which is one of our most significant assets. Operations include the Alba field and related production and condensate facilities, a methanol plant (located on Bioko Island), and an onshore LPG processing plant where additional condensate is produced. The methanol plant was originally designed to produce commercial grade methanol at a rate of 2,500 MTpd gross. As a result of various upgrade efforts, the plant is now capable of producing up to 3,000 MTpd gross. We sell our share of natural gas production from the Alba field to the LPG plant, the methanol plant and an LNG plant. The LPG plant is owned by Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant) in which we have a 28% interest accounted for by the equity method. The methanol plant is owned by Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO) in which we have a 45% interest accounted for by the equity method. The methanol plant purchases natural gas from the Alba field under a contract that runs through 2026. AMPCO subsequently markets the produced methanol to customers in the US and northwestern Europe. We sell our share of condensate produced in the Alba field and from the LPG plant under short term contracts at market based prices. 8 Our exploration activities in West Africa center around Blocks O and I offshore Equatorial Guinea and the PH 77 license offshore the Republic of Cameroon. We are the technical operator on Blocks O and I (45% and 40% working interest, respectively) and the operator on the PH 77 license (50% working interest). We drilled seven wells in the area during 2007 resulting in three new discoveries and three successful appraisal wells: Benita The I 1 well, testing the Benita prospect, resulted in a new gas condensate discovery on Block I. Benita appraisal The I 2 appraisal well on Block I encountered crude oil. Testing has been deferred in order to secure an additional drilling rig that will be capable of further appraisal drilling downdip in the Benita oil column, which is in deeper water. It is expected that a rig will be available for drilling the additional Benita appraisal well in the first quarter of 2008. Yolanda The I 3 well, testing the Yolanda prospect, resulted in another new gas condensate discovery on Block I. I 4 The I 4 well on Block I was a successful well on trend with the 2005 Belinda discovery on Block O. Adriana The O 2 exploration well (the Adriana Southwest prospect) on Block O offshore Equatorial Guinea did not contain commercial hydrocarbons. The well was plugged and abandoned. Belinda appraisal The O 3 appraisal well on Block O successfully extended the Belinda discovery by establishing significant downdip resources. YoYo The YoYo 1 well resulted in a new gas condensate discovery on the PH 77 license offshore the Republic of Cameroon. Additional appraisal work is necessary to verify the areal extent of the discovery. There was also a secondary target, in which commercial hydrocarbons were not found. In 2008, we plan to have an active exploration and appraisal drilling program for both Blocks I and O as we assess our options to commercialize our discoveries in the region. Effective November 2006, the government of Equatorial Guinea enacted a new hydrocarbons law (the 2006 Hydrocarbons Law) governing petroleum operations in Equatorial Guinea. The governmental agency responsible for the energy industry was given the authority to renegotiate any contract for the purpose of adapting any terms and conditions that are inconsistent with the new law. At this time we are uncertain what economic impact this law will have on our operations in Equatorial Guinea. North SeaOperations in the North Sea (the Netherlands, Norway and the UK) comprise another core international asset, and we have been conducting business there since 1996. We have working interests in 23 licenses with working interests ranging from 7% to 100%. We are the operator of four blocks, covered by three licenses. The North Sea accounted for 17% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 8% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 48,230 gross developed acres and 836,625 gross undeveloped acres. In January 2007, production began at the non operated Dumbarton development (30% working interest) in Blocks 15/20a and 15/20b in the UK sector of the North Sea. Dumbarton, a re development of the Donan field, includes a subsea tie back to the GP III, a floating production, storage and offloading vessel in which we own a 30% interest. We expect to continue the development of Dumbarton in 2008 with phases 2a and 2b. In addition, we will participate in the development of the Lochranza prospect, which will also consist of a subsea tie back to the GP III. Exploration efforts continued in 2007 as we and our partners successfully completed an exploratory appraisal well on the Flyndre Block (22.5% working interest) in the UK sector of the North Sea. We also participated in a successful exploration well at Selkirk in Block 22/22b P233 (30.5% working interest), also in the UK sector of the North Sea. Mediterranean Sea (Israel)Operations in Israel accounted for 23% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 14% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 123,552 gross developed acres and 1,183,479 gross undeveloped acres located between 10 and 60 miles offshore Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 5,500 feet. Our leasehold position in Israel includes one preliminary permit, two leases and three licenses, and we are the operator. We have been operating in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Israel, since 1998, and our 47% working interest in the Mari B field is one of our core international assets. The Mari B field is the first offshore natural gas production facility in the State of Israel. During 2007, we completed the Mari B #7, which is designed to produce twice what a normal Mari B well produces in Israel, or approximately 200 MMcfpd of natural gas. The Mari B#7 well has resulted in peak field deliverability of 600 MMcfpd. 9 Natural gas sales began in 2004 and have been increasing steadily as Israels natural gas infrastructure has developed. In 2007, our gas sales volumes increased 19% over 2006 volumes and 67% over 2005 volumes. During 2007 we completed construction of a permanent onshore receiving terminal in Ashdod for distribution of natural gas from the Mari B field to purchasers. Commissioning of the terminal is expected in early 2008. We also began selling natural gas to a desalinization plant and a paper mill in 2007. Additional natural gas sales in 2008 will depend on the timing of onshore pipeline construction and plant conversion, which should allow the Israel Electric Corporation Limited power plants at Gezer and Hagit to consume gas. Exploration activities continue in Israel. We are in the process of securing a rig and intend to drill one exploration well testing the Tamar prospect (33% working interest), offshore northern Israel, in 2008. EcuadorOperations in Ecuador accounted for 5% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 8% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. The concession covers 12,355 gross developed acres and 851,771 gross undeveloped acres. We have been operating in Ecuador since 1996. We are currently utilizing the natural gas from the Amistad field (offshore Ecuador) to generate electricity through a 100% owned natural gas fired power plant, located near the city of Machala. The Machala power plant, which began operating in 2002, is a single cycle generator with a capacity of 130 MW from twin turbines. It is the only natural gas fired commercial power generator in Ecuador and currently one of the lowest cost producers of thermal power in the country. The Machala power plant connects to the Amistad field via a 40 mile pipeline. During 2007, power generation totaled 911,830 MW hours. Other InternationalOther international includes China, Argentina and Suriname. We have been engaged in exploration and development activities in China since 1996 and production began in 2003. We are operator of the Cheng Dao Xi field (57% working interest), which is located in the shallow water of the southern Bohai Bay. During 2007, activities consisted primarily of workover projects. China accounted for 5% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 2% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 7,413 gross developed acres and no undeveloped acres. We continue to work with our Chinese partner (Shengli) to obtain governmental approval of the Supplemental Development Plan, designed to further develop the Cheng Dao Xi field through additional drilling and facilities construction. Our producing properties in Argentina are located in southern Argentina in the El Tordillo field (13% working interest), which is characterized by secondary recovery crude oil production. During 2007, we participated in the drilling of 50 gross (6.7 net) development wells. Argentina accounted for 4% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 2% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 113,325 gross developed acres and no undeveloped acres in Argentina. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective July 1, 2007. We expect the sale, which is subject to regulatory and partner approvals, to close in 2008. Crude oil reserves for the Argentina properties totaled 7 MMBbls at December 31, 2007. Suriname, a country located on the northern coast of South America, represents a new exploration area for us. We have entered into participation agreements on non operated Block 30 (60% working interest) and on Block 32 (100% working interest), which combined cover approximately 7.7 million gross acres offshore. We expect to participate in the drilling of one well on the West Tapir prospect on Block 30 in 2008. 10 Sales Volumes, Price and Cost DataSales volumes, price and cost data are as follows: Average Sales Volumes (1) Average Sales Price Production Cost Natural Gas Crude Oil Natural Gas Crude Oil MMcf MBbls Per Mcf (2) Per Bbl (2) Per BOE (3) Year Ended December 31, 2007 United States 150,457 15,451 $ 7.51 $ 53.22 $ 8.49 West Africa (4) (5) 48,349 5,500 0.29 71.27 2.89 North Sea 2,276 4,564 6.54 76.47 9.81 Israel 40,449 2.79 1.14 Other International (6) 9,385 2,436 53.69 12.06 Total Consolidated Operations 250,916 27,951 5.26 60.61 6.99 Equity Investee (7) 2,805 55.09 Total 250,916 30,756 $ 5.26 $ 60.10 Year Ended December 31, 2006 United States 164,875 16,715 $ 6.61 $ 50.68 $ 8.12 West Africa (4) (5) 16,579 6,519 0.37 62.51 2.86 North Sea 2,967 1,357 8.00 67.43 10.08 Israel 33,906 2.72 1.60 Other International (6) 9,041 2,752 0.96 52.05 9.74 Total Consolidated Operations 227,368 27,343 5.55 54.47 6.97 Equity Investee (7) 2,931 45.83 Total 227,368 30,274 $ 5.55 $ 53.64 Year Ended December 31, 2005 United States 125,543 9,468 $ 7.43 $ 46.67 $ 7.39 West Africa (4) (5) 23,938 6,492 0.25 42.51 2.93 North Sea 3,394 1,964 5.93 52.68 7.54 Israel 24,228 2.68 2.11 Other International (6) 8,389 2,866 1.10 42.37 7.15 Total Consolidated Operations 185,492 20,790 5.78 45.35 6.06 Equity Investee (7) 1,183 43.43 Total 185,492 21,973 $ 5.78 $ 45.25 (1) 2007 volumes include the effect of crude oil sales less than volumes produced of 165 MBbls in Equatorial Guinea, 112 MBbls in the North Sea and 48 MBbls in other international. 2006 volumes include the effect of crude oil sales in excess of volumes produced of 195 MBbls in Equatorial Guinea, less than volumes produced of 99 MBbls in the North Sea, and in excess of volumes produced of 18 MBbls in other international. The variance between production from the field and sales volumes is attributable to the timing of liquid hydrocarbon tanker liftings. Sales volumes equal production volumes in 2005. (2) Average natural gas sales prices in the US reflect an increase of $1.12 per Mcf (2007), and reductions of $0.25 per Mcf (2006) and $0.77 per Mcf (2005) from hedging activities. Average crude oil sales prices for the US reflect reductions of $13.68 per Bbl (2007), $11.41 per Bbl (2006) and $8.03 per Bbl (2005) from hedging activities. Average crude oil sales prices for West Africa reflect reductions of $2.19 (2007) and $9.93 (2005) from hedging activities. We did not hedge West Africa crude oil sales in 2006. (3) Average production costs include oil and gas operating costs, workover and repair expense, production and ad valorem taxes, and transportation expense. (4) Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG facility. Sales to these plants are based on a BTU equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The volumes produced by the LPG plant are included in the crude oil information. For 2007 and 2006, the price on an Mcf basis has been adjusted to reflect the Btu content of gas sales. 11 (5) Equatorial Guinea natural gas volumes include sales to the LNG facility of 78,090 Mcfpd for 2007. There were no natural gas sales to the LNG facility before 2007. (6) Other International natural gas volumes include Ecuador and Argentina. Although Ecuador natural gas volumes are included in Other International production, they are excluded from average natural gas sales prices. We own 100% of the natural gas to power project in Ecuador and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated. Natural gas production volumes associated with the gas to power project were 9,385 MMcf for 2007, 8,933 MMcf for 2006 and 8,321 MMcf for 2005. Other International oil includes China and Argentina. (7) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. LPG volumes were 2,135 MBbls in 2007, 2,297 MBbls in 2006 and 850 MBbls in 2005. Revenues from sales of crude oil and natural gas and from gathering, marketing and processing have accounted for 90% or more of consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years. At December 31, 2007, our operated properties accounted for approximately 62% of our total production. Being the operator of a property improves our ability to directly influence production levels and the timing of projects, while also enhancing our control over operating expenses and capital expenditures. Productive WellsThe number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest as of December 31, 2007 is as follows: Crude Oil Wells Natural Gas Wells Total Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net United States Onshore 7,055 5,997.8 4,609 3,134.5 11,664 9,132.3 United States Offshore 28 26.1 15 8.1 43 34.2 West Africa 1 0.4 19 7.2 20 7.6 North Sea 15 2.7 7 0.7 22 3.4 Israel 8 3.8 8 3.8 Ecuador 5 5.0 5 5.0 China 16 9.1 16 9.1 Argentina 732 95.4 732 95.4 Total 7,847 6,131.5 4,663 3,159.3 12,510 9,290.8 Multiple Completions 8 5.9 14 3.6 22 9.5 Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. A net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. One or more completions in the same borehole are counted as one well in this table. 12 Developed and Undeveloped AcreageDeveloped and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) held at December 31, 2007 was as follows: Developed Acreage Undeveloped Acreage Gross Net Gross Net United States Onshore 1,308,823 835,445 1,234,858 786,391 Offshore 147,945 94,963 485,258 227,627 Total United States 1,456,768 930,408 1,720,116 1,014,018 Equatorial Guinea 45,203 15,727 850,197 379,026 Cameroon 1,125,000 562,500 North Sea (1) 48,230 5,671 836,625 339,151 Israel 123,552 58,142 1,183,479 532,818 China 7,413 4,225 Ecuador 12,355 12,355 851,771 851,771 Argentina 113,325 15,548 Suriname 7,740,328 6,362,884 Total International 350,078 111,668 12,587,400 9,028,150 Total Worldwide (2) 1,806,846 1,042,076 14,307,516 10,042,168 (1) The North Sea includes acreage in the UK, the Netherlands and Norway. In 2008, we entered into an agreement, subject to regulatory approval, to sell our interest in the Norway acreage consisting of 411,065 gross (126,607 net) undeveloped acres. (2) If production is not established, approximately 731,079 gross acres (433,236 net acres) will expire during 2008, 424,734 gross acres (193,554 net acres) will expire during 2009, and 683,274 gross acres (367,949 net acres) will expire during 2010. Developed acreage includes leases that contain wells capable of production. A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. Undeveloped acreage is considered to be those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Drilling ActivityThe results of crude oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three years were as follows: Net Exploratory Wells Net Development Wells Productive Dry Total Productive (1) Dry Total Year Ended December 31, 2007 United States 14.2 4.5 18.7 757.6 27.6 785.2 West Africa 2.6 0.5 3.1 North Sea 0.5 0.5 Israel 0.4 0.4 Argentina 0.1 0.1 6.7 6.7 Total 17.3 5.1 22.4 764.7 27.6 792.3 Year Ended December 31, 2006 United States 6.3 9.0 15.3 666.6 5.5 672.1 West Africa 0.4 0.4 1.8 1.8 North Sea 1.1 1.1 Argentina 7.6 7.6 Total 6.3 9.4 15.7 677.1 5.5 682.6 Year Ended December 31, 2005 United States 4.7 10.7 15.4 488.1 25.9 514.0 West Africa 0.3 0.3 North Sea 0.2 0.2 Argentina 7.7 7.7 Total 4.7 10.9 15.6 496.1 25.9 522.0 (1) Does not include wells drilled but not yet completed. A productive well is an exploratory or a development well that is not a dry well. A dry well (hole) is an exploratory or a development well found to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend a known reservoir. A development well, for purposes of the table above and as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry hole, to the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. In addition to the wells drilled and completed during 2007 included in the table above, at December 31, 2007, we were drilling or completing 2 gross (1.0 net) development wells offshore US, 223 gross (192.3 net) development wells and 4 gross (3.3 net) exploratory wells onshore US and one gross (0.1 net) development well in Argentina. Marketing ActivitiesWe seek opportunities to enhance the value of our US natural gas production by marketing directly to end users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. We also engage in the purchase and sale of third party crude oil and natural gas production. Such third party production may be purchased from non operators who own working interests in our wells or from other producers properties in which we own no interest. Natural gas produced in the US is sold predominately under short term or long term contracts at market based prices. In Equatorial Guinea and Israel, we sell natural gas to end users under long term contracts at negotiated prices. During 2007, approximately 12% of natural gas sales were made pursuant to long term contracts. Crude oil and condensate produced in the US and foreign locations is generally sold under short term contracts at market based prices adjusted for location and quality. In China, we sell crude oil into the local market under a long term contract at market based prices. Crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks or tankers to gatherers, transportation companies and refineries. 13 Significant PurchaserMarathon Petroleum Supply Company (Marathon) was the largest single non affiliated purchaser of 2007 production and purchased our share of condensate from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea. Sales to Marathon accounted for 18% of 2007 crude oil sales, or 10% of 2007 total oil and gas sales. No other single non affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of crude oil and natural gas sales in 2007. We believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production. Hedging ActivitiesCommodity prices remained volatile during 2007 and prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. We have used derivative instruments, and expect to do so in the future, to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk FactorsHedging transactions may limit our potential gains, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesReserves. Engineers in our Houston, Denver and London offices prepare all reserve estimates for our different geographical regions. These reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by senior engineering staff and division management with final approval by the Director of Asset Development and certain members of senior management. During each of the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we retained Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), independent third party reserve engineers, to perform reserve audits of proved reserves. A reserve audit, as we use the term, is a process involving an independent third party engineering firms visits, collection of any and all required geologic, geophysical, engineering and economic data, and such firms complete external preparation of reserve estimates. Our use of the term reserve audit is intended only to refer to the collective application of the procedures which NSAI was engaged to perform. The term reserve audit may be defined and used differently by other companies. The reserve audit for 2007 included a detailed review of 16 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and US fields, which covered approximately 71% of US proved reserves and 96% of international proved reserves (81% of total proved reserves). The reserve audit for 2006 included a detailed review of 14 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and US fields, which covered approximately 80% of our total proved reserves. The reserve audit for 2005 included a detailed review of 11 of our major international, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and US fields, which covered approximately 72% of our total proved reserves. In connection with the 2007 reserve audit, NSAI prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In order to prepare its estimates of proved reserves, NSAI examined our estimates with respect to reserve quantities, future producing rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI also examined our estimates with respect to reserve categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Regulation S X Rule 4 10(a) and subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff interpretations and guidance. In the conduct of the reserve audit, NSAI did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of NSAI which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. NSAI determined that our estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of reasonable certainty, as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4 10(a)(2) of Regulation S X. NSAI issued an unqualified audit opinion on our proved reserves at December 31, 2007, based upon its evaluation. Its opinion concluded that our estimates of proved reserves were, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. 2 The fields that NSAI audits include our most significant fields and are chosen by senior engineering staff and division management with final approval by the Director of Asset Development and certain members of senior management. We usually include all deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields, all international fields that require reports by requirement of the host government, all fields that require sanctioning by our Board of Directors, and other major fields. No significant fields were excluded from the December 31, 2007 reserve audit. When compared on a field by field basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of NSAI. Given the inherent uncertainties and judgments that go into estimating proved reserves, differences between internal and external estimates are to be expected. On a quantity basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 21,966 MBoe above to 16,882 MBoe below as compared with our estimates. On a percentage basis, the NSAI field estimates ranged from 9% above our estimates to 42% below our estimates. Differences between our estimates and those of NSAI are reviewed for accuracy but are not further analyzed unless the aggregate variance is greater than 10%. At December 31, 2007, reserves differences, in the aggregate, were less than 13,200 MBoe, or 2%. Since January 1, 2007, no crude oil or natural gas reserve information has been filed with, or included in any report to any federal authority or agency other than the SEC and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US Department of Energy. We file Form 23, including reserve and other information, with the EIA. Acquisition and Divestiture Activities We maintain an ongoing portfolio optimization program. We may engage in acquisitions of additional crude oil or natural gas properties and related assets through either direct acquisitions of the assets or acquisitions of entities owning the assets. We may also divest non core assets in order to optimize our property portfolio. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective July 1, 2007. We expect the sale, which is subject to regulatory and partner approvals, to close in 2008. Crude oil reserves for the Argentina properties totaled 7 MMBbls at December 31, 2007. In 2006, we sold all of our Gulf of Mexico shelf properties except for the Main Pass area, which is undergoing redevelopment studies. As of the effective date of the sale, proved reserves for the Gulf of Mexico properties sold totaled approximately 7 MMBbls of crude oil and 110 Bcf of natural gas. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast onshore areas remain core areas and are more aligned with our long term business strategies. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3Acquisitions and Divestitures. In 2006, we acquired U.S. Exploration, a privately held corporation, for $412 million plus liabilities assumed. U.S. Explorations reserves and production are located in Colorados Wattenberg field. This acquisition significantly expanded our operations in one of our core areas. Proved reserves of U.S. Exploration at the time of acquisition were approximately 234 Bcfe, of which 38% of the reserves were proved developed and 55% of the reserves were natural gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $413 million and unproved properties were valued at $131 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3Acquisitions and Divestitures. In 2005, we acquired Patina through merger (Patina Merger) for a total purchase price of $4.9 billion. Patinas long lived crude oil and natural gas reserves provide a significant inventory of low risk opportunities that balanced our portfolio. Patinas proved reserves at the time of acquisition were estimated to be approximately 1.6 Tcfe, of which 72% of the reserves were proved developed and 67% of the reserves were natural gas. Proved crude oil and natural gas properties were valued at $2.6 billion and unproved properties were valued at $1.1 billion. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3Acquisitions and Divestitures. 3 Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Activities We search for crude oil and natural gas properties, seek to acquire exploration rights in areas of interest and conduct exploratory activities. These activities include geophysical and geological evaluation and exploratory drilling, where appropriate, on properties for which we have acquired exploration rights. Our properties consist primarily of interests in developed and undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases. We also own natural gas processing plants and natural gas gathering and other crude oil and natural gas related pipeline systems. United States We have been engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities throughout onshore US since 1932 and in the Gulf of Mexico since 1968. The Patina Merger and the acquisition of U.S. Exploration have significantly increased the breadth of our onshore operations, especially in the Rocky Mountain and Mid continent areas. These two acquisitions have provided us with a multi year inventory of exploitation and development opportunities. In 2007, we continued to expand our acreage position with the acquisition of approximately 290,000 net acres in the Piceance, Niobrara, and New Albany Shale areas. US operations accounted for 58% of our 2007 consolidated sales volumes and 58% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2007. Approximately 60% of the proved reserves are natural gas and 40% are crude oil. Our onshore US portfolio at December 31, 2007 included 1,308,823 gross developed acres and 1,234,858 gross undeveloped acres. We also hold interests in 97 offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $1.2 billion, or 74%, of budgeted capital in the US. Sales of production and estimates of proved reserves for our significant US operating areas were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Sales Volumes Proved Reserves Natural Gas Crude Oil Total Natural Gas Crude Oil Total (MMcf) (MBbls) (MBoe) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe) Northern Region Wattenberg 59,670 4,674 14,619 893 109 258 Piceance 7,797 7 1,307 183 31 Niobrara 7,897 1,316 98 16 Other 9,392 53 1,618 139 1 24 Total 84,756 4,734 18,860 1,313 110 329 Southern Region Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 18,722 5,847 8,967 79 21 34 Mid continent 30,760 3,340 8,467 341 51 108 Gulf Coast onshore and other 16,219 1,530 4,233 107 25 43 Total 65,701 10,717 21,667 527 97 185 Total United States 150,457 15,451 40,527 1,840 207 514 4 Additional information for our significant US operating areas is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Gross Wells Drilled/ Gross Participated in Productive Wells Northern Region Wattenberg 508 5,161 Piceance 55 112 Niobrara 125 744 Other 56 1,239 Total 744 7,256 Southern Region Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 6 13 Mid continent 147 3,981 Gulf Coast onshore and other 38 457 Total 191 4,451 Total United States 935 11,707 Northern RegionThe Northern region consists of our operations in the Rocky Mountain area, which includes the D J (Wattenberg field), San Juan, Wind River, and Piceance basins, as well as the Niobrara, Bowdoin and Siberia Ridge fields. The addition of Patina and U.S. Exploration assets, particularly in the Wattenberg field, combined with our legacy operations in the Bowdoin field, the Niobrara trend, the Wind River basin and Piceance basin, have made the Rocky Mountains one of our core operating areas. We are currently running 13 drilling rigs and 24 completion/workover units. We plan to invest approximately $744 million, or 62% of budgeted US capital in the Northern region during 2008. Wattenberg FieldThe Wattenberg field (approximately 97% operated working interest), our largest US asset, continues to grow production and reserves. In 2007, sales of production from this field accounted for 36% of total US sales volumes. Wattenberg field proved reserves accounted for 50% of US proved reserves at December 31, 2007. We acquired working interests in the Wattenberg field through the Patina Merger in 2005 and acquisition of U.S. Exploration in 2006. Located in the D J basin of north central Colorado, the Wattenberg field provides us with a substantial future project inventory. One of the most attractive features of the field is the presence of multiple productive formations, which include the Codell, Niobrara and J Sand formations, as well as the D Sand, Dakota and the shallower Shannon, Sussex and Parkman formations. Drilling in the Wattenberg field is considered lower risk from the perspective of finding crude oil and natural gas reserves, with 99.8% of the wells drilled in 2007 encountering sufficient quantities of reserves to be completed as economic producers. In May 1998, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) adopted the Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A which allows all formations in the Wattenberg field to be drilled, produced and commingled from any or all of ten potential drilling locations on a 320 acre parcel. A commingled well is one which produces crude oil from two or more formations or zones through a common string of casing and tubing. In December 2005, the COGCC amended Rule 318A providing for an effective well density of one well per 20 acres in a designated portion of the Greater Wattenberg Area to more effectively drain the reservoir. The amendment applies only to the Niobrara, Codell and J Sand formations and became effective in March 2006. We are currently running seven drilling rigs and 17 completion units in the Wattenberg field. Our current field activities are focused primarily on the development of J Sand, Codell and Niobrara reserves through drilling new wells or deepening within existing wellbores, recompleting the Codell formation within existing J Sand wells, refracturing or trifracturing existing Codell wells and refracturing or recompleting the Niobrara formation within existing Codell wells. A refracture consists of the restimulation of a producing formation within an existing wellbore to enhance production and add incremental reserves. A trifracture is effectively a refracture of a refracture. These projects and continued success with our production enhancement program, which includes well workovers, reactivations, and commingling of zones, allow us to increase production and add proved reserves to what is considered a mature field. During 2007, we drilled or participated in 508 development wells, with a 99.8% success rate, and added approximately 244 Bcfe of proved reserves in the Wattenberg field. Approximately 58% of these reserve additions were natural gas. We also grew production from an average of 227 MMcfe per day for 2006 to 240 MMcfe per day for 2007. We plan to drill approximately 480 wells in 2008 (of which 337 will be combination Codell/Niobrara new drills). We also plan to participate in 120 non operated drilling projects in 2008. We have a substantial project inventory remaining and plan to perform approximately 340 projects including refractures, trifractures, and recompletions during 2008. 5 Other Rocky Mountain areas include: Niobrara TrendThe Niobrara trend (approximately 87% operated working interest) is located in eastern Colorado and extends into Kansas and Nebraska. During 2007, we expanded our acreage position with the acquisition of 160,000 net acres. We are currently running two drilling rigs and three completion units. During 2007, we drilled or participated in 125 wells with a 79% success rate, and our activity resulted in the addition of 19 Bcfe of proved reserves. We plan to drill 300 wells in 2008. Piceance BasinThe Piceance basin in western Colorado (approximately 96% operated working interest) is another rapidly growing area for us. During 2007, we added 10,500 net acres to our position. We are currently running four drilling rigs and three completion units. We drilled or participated in 55 development wells during 2007, 100% of which were successful, and our activity resulted in the addition of 83 Bcfe of proved reserves. We plan to drill over 100 wells during 2008. OtherWe are also active in the Bowdoin field (approximately 60% operated working interest), located in north central Montana; the San Juan basin (approximately 81% operated working interest), located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado; and the Wind River basin (approximately 56% operated working interest), located in central Wyoming. During 2007 we drilled or participated in a total of 56 development wells in these areas, 100% of which were successful. We plan to drill approximately 60 wells and recomplete 190 wells during 2008. Southern RegionThe Southern region includes the Gulf Coast onshore, West and East Texas, Louisiana, and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Mid continent area (the Texas Panhandle and parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Illinois and Indiana). The Gulf Coast and deepwater Gulf of Mexico are core US operating areas. During 2006, we sold all of our Gulf of Mexico shelf properties except for the Main Pass area. The sale of our shelf properties allows us to migrate future investments and growth from the Gulf of Mexico shelf to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which we believe is an area of higher potential. We plan to invest approximately $460 million, or 38% of budgeted US capital, in the Southern region during 2008, with approximately 67% in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the remainder to the Gulf Coast and the Mid continent areas. Deepwater Gulf of MexicoDeepwater Gulf of Mexico accounted for 22% of 2007 US sales volumes and 7% of US proved reserves at December 31, 2007. During 2007, we continued to focus on the growth of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico business highlighted by a successful exploration discovery at Isabela and a successful sidetrack appraisal well at our 2006 Raton discovery. We also completed successful development drilling programs in our Ticonderoga and Swordfish fields. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity resulted in proved reserve additions of 12 MMBoe during 2007. Participation in the 2007 Central Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Sale resulted in our being awarded eight new deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases totaling $50 million. At year end, development planning was underway for Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562, 33% working interest). We have also acquired an interest in adjacent acreage with additional exploration potential on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 519 and 563 (23.25% working interest). We plan to drill a well on Block 519 (Santa Cruz Prospect) in 2008 pending rig availability. In total there are three prospects on the combined leasehold that, conceptually, would be co developed in a subsea tieback to an existing production facility. Other 2007 exploration drilling included the Mississippi Canyon Block 568 #1 (Robusto Prospect, 20% working interest) and the East Breaks Block 465 #1 (Lost Ark South Prospect, 98.4% working interest), neither of which encountered hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. During 2007 we saw an extremely active deepwater Gulf of Mexico development program. At our Raton project in Mississippi Canyon Block 248 (66.67% operated working interest), we successfully sidetracked and completed the 248 #1 discovery well drilled in 2006. At year end the project had moved into the development stage and is slated for subsea tieback and first production in the second quarter of 2008. At our operated Swordfish project (85% working interest), we drilled and completed a sidetrack to Viosca Knoll Block 917 #1 well and began gas production from this well at year end. At the Ticonderoga development in Green Canyon Block 768 (50% working interest, non operated), the #3 and #1 ST4 wells were drilled and completed to extend and enhance production from the field. Both are slated for first production in the first quarter of 2008. 6 At the Lost Ark project in East Breaks Blocks 421 and 464 (48.4% operated working interest), the 421 #1 well, which had reached the end of its productive life, was plugged and abandoned, and the 464 #1 well was completed and put on production to develop the remaining reserves at the field. We are currently evaluating a possible sidetrack appraisal well to be drilled at the Raton South oil discovery in Mississippi Canyon Block 292 during late 2008 (originally drilled in 2006). The Redrock natural gas/condensate discovery, also drilled in 2006, is currently considered a co development candidate to a successful sidetrack appraisal well at Raton South. Additional key exploration activity planned for 2008 includes a well at the Mississippi Canyon Block 948, Gunflint prospect, (50% working interest), in the second half of 2008. Mid continentA significant area of activity in Mid continent is the Granite Wash development, located in the Texas Panhandle. We drilled or participated in 53 development wells in 2007, 100% of which were successful. The potential for horizontal drilling is currently being evaluated. Another significant area in Mid continent is the ongoing Southern Oklahoma development. In 2007 we drilled or participated in 45 wells resulting in additional incremental production of 1,515 Boepd. In addition, we continue to selectively increase our acreage position in resource plays, including shale plays. We have accumulated over 179,000 acres in the New Albany Shale. During 2007, we drilled 16 New Albany Shale wells. Currently nine are producing and seven are in the progress of pipeline connection. The Paxton facility, which we operate, will serve the majority of wells in the Paxton field. We plan to have an active drilling program during 2008. Other Mid continent areas include parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana and Arkansas. During 2007, we drilled or participated in a total of 33 wells. We plan to drill or participate in 60 wells in the Mid continent area during 2008. Gulf Coast OnshoreDuring late 2007, we began a six well program at Oliver Creek in Shelby County, Texas to develop the Travis Peak reservoir as well as test deeper Cotton Valley horizons. We have completed one Travis Peak well and are currently completing the second Travis Peak well. The deeper Cotton Valley horizons are being tested in two additional wells currently being drilled or completed. Two additional wells remain in the current six well program. Additional drilling is planned for later in 2008. International International operations are significant to our business, accounting for 42% of consolidated sales volumes in 2007 and 42% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2007. International proved reserves are approximately 67% natural gas and 33% crude oil. Operations in Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Ecuador, China and Suriname are conducted in accordance with the terms of production sharing contracts. In 2008, we plan to invest approximately $392 million, or 24%, of budgeted capital in our international locations. 7 Additional information for our significant international operating areas is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Sales Volumes Proved Reserves Natural Gas Crude Oil Total Natural Gas Crude Oil Total (MMcf) (MBbls) (MBoe) (Bcf) (MMBbls) (MMBoe) International West Africa 48,349 5,500 13,558 941 82 239 North Sea 2,276 4,564 4,943 19 25 28 Israel 40,449 6,742 319 53 Ecuador 9,385 1,564 188 31 China 1,402 1,402 8 8 Argentina 1,034 1,034 7 7 Total consolidated 100,459 12,500 29,243 1,467 122 366 Equity investees: Condensate (MBbls) 670 670 LPG (MBbls) 2,135 2,135 Total 100,459 15,305 32,048 Equity investee share of methanol sales (Kgal) 160,540 Wells drilled in 2007 and productive wells at December 31, 2007 in our international operating areas were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 December 31, 2007 Gross Wells Gross Drilled/Participated in Productive Wells International West Africa 7 20 North Sea 2 22 Israel 1 8 Ecuador 5 China 16 Argentina 50 732 Total International 60 803 West Africa (Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon)Operations in West Africa accounted for 46% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 65% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 45,203 gross developed acres and 850,197 gross undeveloped acres in Equatorial Guinea and 1,125,000 gross undeveloped acres in Cameroon. We began investing in West Africa in the early 1990s. Activities center around our 34% non operated working interest in the Alba field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which is one of our most significant assets. Operations include the Alba field and related production and condensate facilities, a methanol plant (located on Bioko Island), and an onshore LPG processing plant where additional condensate is produced. The methanol plant was originally designed to produce commercial grade methanol at a rate of 2,500 MTpd gross. As a result of various upgrade efforts, the plant is now capable of producing up to 3,000 MTpd gross. We sell our share of natural gas production from the Alba field to the LPG plant, the methanol plant and an LNG plant. The LPG plant is owned by Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant) in which we have a 28% interest accounted for by the equity method. The methanol plant is owned by Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO) in which we have a 45% interest accounted for by the equity method. The methanol plant purchases natural gas from the Alba field under a contract that runs through 2026. AMPCO subsequently markets the produced methanol to customers in the US and northwestern Europe. We sell our share of condensate produced in the Alba field and from the LPG plant under short term contracts at market based prices. 8 Our exploration activities in West Africa center around Blocks O and I offshore Equatorial Guinea and the PH 77 license offshore the Republic of Cameroon. We are the technical operator on Blocks O and I (45% and 40% working interest, respectively) and the operator on the PH 77 license (50% working interest). We drilled seven wells in the area during 2007 resulting in three new discoveries and three successful appraisal wells: Benita The I 1 well, testing the Benita prospect, resulted in a new gas condensate discovery on Block I. Benita appraisal The I 2 appraisal well on Block I encountered crude oil. Testing has been deferred in order to secure an additional drilling rig that will be capable of further appraisal drilling downdip in the Benita oil column, which is in deeper water. It is expected that a rig will be available for drilling the additional Benita appraisal well in the first quarter of 2008. Yolanda The I 3 well, testing the Yolanda prospect, resulted in another new gas condensate discovery on Block I. I 4 The I 4 well on Block I was a successful well on trend with the 2005 Belinda discovery on Block O. Adriana The O 2 exploration well (the Adriana Southwest prospect) on Block O offshore Equatorial Guinea did not contain commercial hydrocarbons. The well was plugged and abandoned. Belinda appraisal The O 3 appraisal well on Block O successfully extended the Belinda discovery by establishing significant downdip resources. YoYo The YoYo 1 well resulted in a new gas condensate discovery on the PH 77 license offshore the Republic of Cameroon. Additional appraisal work is necessary to verify the areal extent of the discovery. There was also a secondary target, in which commercial hydrocarbons were not found. In 2008, we plan to have an active exploration and appraisal drilling program for both Blocks I and O as we assess our options to commercialize our discoveries in the region. Effective November 2006, the government of Equatorial Guinea enacted a new hydrocarbons law (the 2006 Hydrocarbons Law) governing petroleum operations in Equatorial Guinea. The governmental agency responsible for the energy industry was given the authority to renegotiate any contract for the purpose of adapting any terms and conditions that are inconsistent with the new law. At this time we are uncertain what economic impact this law will have on our operations in Equatorial Guinea. North SeaOperations in the North Sea (the Netherlands, Norway and the UK) comprise another core international asset, and we have been conducting business there since 1996. We have working interests in 23 licenses with working interests ranging from 7% to 100%. We are the operator of four blocks, covered by three licenses. The North Sea accounted for 17% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 8% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 48,230 gross developed acres and 836,625 gross undeveloped acres. In January 2007, production began at the non operated Dumbarton development (30% working interest) in Blocks 15/20a and 15/20b in the UK sector of the North Sea. Dumbarton, a re development of the Donan field, includes a subsea tie back to the GP III, a floating production, storage and offloading vessel in which we own a 30% interest. We expect to continue the development of Dumbarton in 2008 with phases 2a and 2b. In addition, we will participate in the development of the Lochranza prospect, which will also consist of a subsea tie back to the GP III. Exploration efforts continued in 2007 as we and our partners successfully completed an exploratory appraisal well on the Flyndre Block (22.5% working interest) in the UK sector of the North Sea. We also participated in a successful exploration well at Selkirk in Block 22/22b P233 (30.5% working interest), also in the UK sector of the North Sea. Mediterranean Sea (Israel)Operations in Israel accounted for 23% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 14% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 123,552 gross developed acres and 1,183,479 gross undeveloped acres located between 10 and 60 miles offshore Israel in water depths ranging from 700 feet to 5,500 feet. Our leasehold position in Israel includes one preliminary permit, two leases and three licenses, and we are the operator. We have been operating in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Israel, since 1998, and our 47% working interest in the Mari B field is one of our core international assets. The Mari B field is the first offshore natural gas production facility in the State of Israel. During 2007, we completed the Mari B #7, which is designed to produce twice what a normal Mari B well produces in Israel, or approximately 200 MMcfpd of natural gas. The Mari B#7 well has resulted in peak field deliverability of 600 MMcfpd. 9 Natural gas sales began in 2004 and have been increasing steadily as Israels natural gas infrastructure has developed. In 2007, our gas sales volumes increased 19% over 2006 volumes and 67% over 2005 volumes. During 2007 we completed construction of a permanent onshore receiving terminal in Ashdod for distribution of natural gas from the Mari B field to purchasers. Commissioning of the terminal is expected in early 2008. We also began selling natural gas to a desalinization plant and a paper mill in 2007. Additional natural gas sales in 2008 will depend on the timing of onshore pipeline construction and plant conversion, which should allow the Israel Electric Corporation Limited power plants at Gezer and Hagit to consume gas. Exploration activities continue in Israel. We are in the process of securing a rig and intend to drill one exploration well testing the Tamar prospect (33% working interest), offshore northern Israel, in 2008. EcuadorOperations in Ecuador accounted for 5% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 8% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. The concession covers 12,355 gross developed acres and 851,771 gross undeveloped acres. We have been operating in Ecuador since 1996. We are currently utilizing the natural gas from the Amistad field (offshore Ecuador) to generate electricity through a 100% owned natural gas fired power plant, located near the city of Machala. The Machala power plant, which began operating in 2002, is a single cycle generator with a capacity of 130 MW from twin turbines. It is the only natural gas fired commercial power generator in Ecuador and currently one of the lowest cost producers of thermal power in the country. The Machala power plant connects to the Amistad field via a 40 mile pipeline. During 2007, power generation totaled 911,830 MW hours. Other InternationalOther international includes China, Argentina and Suriname. We have been engaged in exploration and development activities in China since 1996 and production began in 2003. We are operator of the Cheng Dao Xi field (57% working interest), which is located in the shallow water of the southern Bohai Bay. During 2007, activities consisted primarily of workover projects. China accounted for 5% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 2% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 7,413 gross developed acres and no undeveloped acres. We continue to work with our Chinese partner (Shengli) to obtain governmental approval of the Supplemental Development Plan, designed to further develop the Cheng Dao Xi field through additional drilling and facilities construction. Our producing properties in Argentina are located in southern Argentina in the El Tordillo field (13% working interest), which is characterized by secondary recovery crude oil production. During 2007, we participated in the drilling of 50 gross (6.7 net) development wells. Argentina accounted for 4% of 2007 consolidated international sales volumes and 2% of international proved reserves at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we held 113,325 gross developed acres and no undeveloped acres in Argentina. In December 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective July 1, 2007. We expect the sale, which is subject to regulatory and partner approvals, to close in 2008. Crude oil reserves for the Argentina properties totaled 7 MMBbls at December 31, 2007. Suriname, a country located on the northern coast of South America, represents a new exploration area for us. We have entered into participation agreements on non operated Block 30 (60% working interest) and on Block 32 (100% working interest), which combined cover approximately 7.7 million gross acres offshore. We expect to participate in the drilling of one well on the West Tapir prospect on Block 30 in 2008. 10 Sales Volumes, Price and Cost DataSales volumes, price and cost data are as follows: Average Sales Volumes (1) Average Sales Price Production Cost Natural Gas Crude Oil Natural Gas Crude Oil MMcf MBbls Per Mcf (2) Per Bbl (2) Per BOE (3) Year Ended December 31, 2007 United States 150,457 15,451 $ 7.51 $ 53.22 $ 8.49 West Africa (4) (5) 48,349 5,500 0.29 71.27 2.89 North Sea 2,276 4,564 6.54 76.47 9.81 Israel 40,449 2.79 1.14 Other International (6) 9,385 2,436 53.69 12.06 Total Consolidated Operations 250,916 27,951 5.26 60.61 6.99 Equity Investee (7) 2,805 55.09 Total 250,916 30,756 $ 5.26 $ 60.10 Year Ended December 31, 2006 United States 164,875 16,715 $ 6.61 $ 50.68 $ 8.12 West Africa (4) (5) 16,579 6,519 0.37 62.51 2.86 North Sea 2,967 1,357 8.00 67.43 10.08 Israel 33,906 2.72 1.60 Other International (6) 9,041 2,752 0.96 52.05 9.74 Total Consolidated Operations 227,368 27,343 5.55 54.47 6.97 Equity Investee (7) 2,931 45.83 Total 227,368 30,274 $ 5.55 $ 53.64 Year Ended December 31, 2005 United States 125,543 9,468 $ 7.43 $ 46.67 $ 7.39 West Africa (4) (5) 23,938 6,492 0.25 42.51 2.93 North Sea 3,394 1,964 5.93 52.68 7.54 Israel 24,228 2.68 2.11 Other International (6) 8,389 2,866 1.10 42.37 7.15 Total Consolidated Operations 185,492 20,790 5.78 45.35 6.06 Equity Investee (7) 1,183 43.43 Total 185,492 21,973 $ 5.78 $ 45.25 (1) 2007 volumes include the effect of crude oil sales less than volumes produced of 165 MBbls in Equatorial Guinea, 112 MBbls in the North Sea and 48 MBbls in other international. 2006 volumes include the effect of crude oil sales in excess of volumes produced of 195 MBbls in Equatorial Guinea, less than volumes produced of 99 MBbls in the North Sea, and in excess of volumes produced of 18 MBbls in other international. The variance between production from the field and sales volumes is attributable to the timing of liquid hydrocarbon tanker liftings. Sales volumes equal production volumes in 2005. (2) Average natural gas sales prices in the US reflect an increase of $1.12 per Mcf (2007), and reductions of $0.25 per Mcf (2006) and $0.77 per Mcf (2005) from hedging activities. Average crude oil sales prices for the US reflect reductions of $13.68 per Bbl (2007), $11.41 per Bbl (2006) and $8.03 per Bbl (2005) from hedging activities. Average crude oil sales prices for West Africa reflect reductions of $2.19 (2007) and $9.93 (2005) from hedging activities. We did not hedge West Africa crude oil sales in 2006. (3) Average production costs include oil and gas operating costs, workover and repair expense, production and ad valorem taxes, and transportation expense. (4) Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG facility. Sales to these plants are based on a BTU equivalent and then converted to a dry gas equivalent volume. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The volumes produced by the LPG plant are included in the crude oil information. For 2007 and 2006, the price on an Mcf basis has been adjusted to reflect the Btu content of gas sales. 11 (5) Equatorial Guinea natural gas volumes include sales to the LNG facility of 78,090 Mcfpd for 2007. There were no natural gas sales to the LNG facility before 2007. (6) Other International natural gas volumes include Ecuador and Argentina. Although Ecuador natural gas volumes are included in Other International production, they are excluded from average natural gas sales prices. We own 100% of the natural gas to power project in Ecuador and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated. Natural gas production volumes associated with the gas to power project were 9,385 MMcf for 2007, 8,933 MMcf for 2006 and 8,321 MMcf for 2005. Other International oil includes China and Argentina. (7) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. LPG volumes were 2,135 MBbls in 2007, 2,297 MBbls in 2006 and 850 MBbls in 2005. Revenues from sales of crude oil and natural gas and from gathering, marketing and processing have accounted for 90% or more of consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years. At December 31, 2007, our operated properties accounted for approximately 62% of our total production. Being the operator of a property improves our ability to directly influence production levels and the timing of projects, while also enhancing our control over operating expenses and capital expenditures.

A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned. A net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. One or more completions in the same borehole are counted as one well in this table. 12 Developed and Undeveloped AcreageDeveloped and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) held at December 31, 2007 was as follows: Developed Acreage Undeveloped Acreage Gross Net Gross Net United States Onshore 1,308,823 835,445 1,234,858 786,391 Offshore 147,945 94,963 485,258 227,627 Total United States 1,456,768 930,408 1,720,116 1,014,018 Equatorial Guinea 45,203 15,727 850,197 379,026 Cameroon 1,125,000 562,500 North Sea (1) 48,230 5,671 836,625 339,151 Israel 123,552 58,142 1,183,479 532,818 China 7,413 4,225 Ecuador 12,355 12,355 851,771 851,771 Argentina 113,325 15,548 Suriname 7,740,328 6,362,884 Total International 350,078 111,668 12,587,400 9,028,150 Total Worldwide (2) 1,806,846 1,042,076 14,307,516 10,042,168 (1) The North Sea includes acreage in the UK, the Netherlands and Norway. In 2008, we entered into an agreement, subject to regulatory approval, to sell our interest in the Norway acreage consisting of 411,065 gross (126,607 net) undeveloped acres. (2) If production is not established, approximately 731,079 gross acres (433,236 net acres) will expire during 2008, 424,734 gross acres (193,554 net acres) will expire during 2009, and 683,274 gross acres (367,949 net acres) will expire during 2010. Developed acreage includes leases that contain wells capable of production. A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. Undeveloped acreage is considered to be those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves.

A productive well is an exploratory or a development well that is not a dry well. A dry well (hole) is an exploratory or a development well found to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend a known reservoir. A development well, for purposes of the table above and as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry hole, to the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. In addition to the wells drilled and completed during 2007 included in the table above, at December 31, 2007, we were drilling or completing 2 gross (1.0 net) development wells offshore US, 223 gross (192.3 net) development wells and 4 gross (3.3 net) exploratory wells onshore US and one gross (0.1 net) development well in Argentina. Marketing ActivitiesWe seek opportunities to enhance the value of our US natural gas production by marketing directly to end users and aggregating natural gas to be sold to natural gas marketers and pipelines. We also engage in the purchase and sale of third party crude oil and natural gas production. Such third party production may be purchased from non operators who own working interests in our wells or from other producers properties in which we own no interest. Natural gas produced in the US is sold predominately under short term or long term contracts at market based prices. In Equatorial Guinea and Israel, we sell natural gas to end users under long term contracts at negotiated prices. During 2007, approximately 12% of natural gas sales were made pursuant to long term contracts. Crude oil and condensate produced in the US and foreign locations is generally sold under short term contracts at market based prices adjusted for location and quality. In China, we sell crude oil into the local market under a long term contract at market based prices. Crude oil and condensate are distributed through pipelines and by trucks or tankers to gatherers, transportation companies and refineries. 13 Significant PurchaserMarathon Petroleum Supply Company (Marathon) was the largest single non affiliated purchaser of 2007 production and purchased our share of condensate from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea. Sales to Marathon accounted for 18% of 2007 crude oil sales, or 10% of 2007 total oil and gas sales. No other single non affiliated purchaser accounted for 10% or more of crude oil and natural gas sales in 2007. We believe that the loss of any one purchaser would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since there are numerous potential purchasers of our production. Hedging ActivitiesCommodity prices remained volatile during 2007 and prices for crude oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. We have used derivative instruments, and expect to do so in the future, to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to commodity price fluctuations.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas domestically and internationally. We operate throughout major basins in the US including Colorados Wattenberg field and Piceance basin, the Mid continent area of western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, the San Juan basin in New Mexico, the Gulf Coast and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We also conduct business internationally, in China, Ecuador, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, West Africa (Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon) and in other areas. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas. Our strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through the development of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is diversified between US and international projects. The Patina Merger, purchase of U.S. Exploration and sale of Gulf of Mexico shelf properties have allowed us to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing our US asset portfolio. The result is a company with assets and capabilities that include growing US basins coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties. Our reserve base includes both US and international sources at 58% US and 42% international. We are now a larger, more diversified company with greater opportunities for both US and international growth. 2007 was a strong year for us, both financially and operationally. Significant financial results included the following: net income of $944 million, a 39% increase over 2006 net income; diluted earnings per share of $5.45, a 44% increase over 2006; cash flow provided by operating activities of $2.0 billion, a 17% increase over 2006; and completion of a $500 million common stock repurchase program begun in 2006. Significant operational highlights included the following: eight successful exploration wells drilled internationally, six offshore West Africa and two in the North Sea; deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration success at Isabela (Mississippi Canyon Block 562); commencement of production and continued ramp up at the Dumbarton development and successful exploratory appraisal well drilled at the Flyndre prospect in the UK sector of the North Sea; completion of the Mari B #7 well and record natural gas sales in Israel; continued success of development program in the US Wattenberg field; and acquisition of approximately 290,000 net acres onshore US in the Piceance basin, Niobrara trend and New Albany Shale areas. Sale of ArgentinaIn December 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million, effective July 1, 2007. We expect the sale, which is subject to regulatory and partner approvals, to close in 2008. Equatorial Guinea 2006 Hydrocarbons LawEffective November 2006, the government of Equatorial Guinea enacted the 2006 Hydrocarbons Law governing petroleum operations in Equatorial Guinea. The governmental agency responsible for the energy industry was given the authority to renegotiate any contract for the purpose of adapting any terms and conditions that are inconsistent with the new law. The stated purpose of the law is to modify the legal framework in order to deal with a variety of matters that were not previously or adequately covered, with the law addressing areas such as minimum participation of the state in contract areas, training and social programs and the establishment of environmental programs. At this time we are uncertain what economic impact this law will have on our operations in Equatorial Guinea, as regulations contemplated by the law have not been implemented and the application of certain of the laws provisions is unknown. 23 2008 OUTLOOK We expect crude oil and natural gas production to increase in 2008 compared to 2007. Factors which may impact our expected year over year increase in production include: higher sales of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea; and growing production from the D J and Piceance basins, where we are continuing active drilling programs; offset by: natural field decline in the Gulf Coast area. Factors which may impact our expected production profile include: potential hurricane related volume curtailments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas; potential winter storm related volume curtailments in the Northern region of our US operations; potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountain area of our US operations; infrastructure development in Israel; potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and or LNG facilities in Equatorial Guinea; seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect our natural gas to power project; and timing of capital expenditures, as discussed below, which are expected to result in near term production. 2008 BudgetWe have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion for 2008. Approximately 24% of the 2008 capital budget has been allocated to exploration opportunities and 76% has been allocated to production, development and other projects. US spending is budgeted for $1.2 billion, international expenditures are budgeted for $392 million and corporate expenditures are budgeted for $27 million. The 2008 budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases. We expect that the 2008 capital budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations and property acquisitions and divestitures. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. When alternatives exist among various accounting methods, the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts. The following is a discussion of the accounting policies, estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in the application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Purchase Price AllocationAs a result of the Patina Merger in 2005 and the acquisition of U.S. Exploration in 2006, we acquired assets and assumed liabilities in transactions accounted for as purchases. In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed we made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We estimated future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired, and estimated future operating and development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows were discounted using a market based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the merger. The market based weighted average cost of capital rate was subjected to additional project specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves were reduced by additional risk weighting factors. 24 Estimated deferred taxes were based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. While the estimates of fair value for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our cash flows, they can have an effect on the future results of operations. Generally, higher fair values assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties result in higher future depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense, which results in decreased future net earnings. Also, a higher fair value assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties, based on higher estimates of future crude oil and natural gas prices, could increase the likelihood of impairment in the event of lower commodity prices or higher operating or development costs than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. GoodwillAs of December 31, 2007, the consolidated balance sheet included $760 million of goodwill, all of which has been assigned to the US reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings but is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. We conduct the goodwill impairment test as of December 31 of each year. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. If the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be impaired, the amount of goodwill is reduced and a corresponding charge is made to earnings in the period in which the goodwill is determined to be impaired. The impairment assessment requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. The fair value of the US reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is estimated based on selected financial metrics. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, appropriate discount rates and other variables. Downward revisions of estimated reserve quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit, or sustained decreases in natural gas or crude oil prices could lead to an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods. Under the market approach, we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums. Although we have based the fair value estimate on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ from the estimate. In 2007, no goodwill impairment was recognized. When we dispose of a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business, we include goodwill associated with that business in the carrying amount of the business in order to determine the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount is based on the relative fair value of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. During 2006, we allocated $100 million of US reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of our Gulf of Mexico shelf properties sold. The amount of goodwill allocated to the carrying amount of a business can significantly impact the amount of gain or loss recognized on the sale of that business. ReservesAll of the reserve data in this Form 10 K are estimates. Estimates of our crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by our engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect our DD&A expense. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, the DD&A rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves could also trigger an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge, which would reduce earnings. In addition, a decline in estimates of proved reserves could trigger a goodwill impairment analysis. 25 Oil and Gas PropertiesWe account for crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. The alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method. Under the successful efforts method, costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Proved property acquisition costs are amortized to operations by the unit of production method on a property by property basis based on total proved crude oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by our engineers. Costs to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are also amortized to operations by the unit of production method on a property by property basis. They are amortized based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. Application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals, during the periods the costs are incurred. Under the full cost method, these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of DD&A expense. In addition, under the full cost method capitalized costs are accumulated in pools on a country by country basis. DD&A is computed on a country by country basis, and capitalized costs are limited on the same basis through the application of a ceiling test. We believe the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use in accounting for our crude oil and natural gas properties as this method is better aligned with our business strategy. If we had used the full cost method, our financial position and results of operations could have been significantly different. Exploratory Well CostsIn accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting, the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well may be capitalized temporarily, or suspended, pending a determination of whether commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas have been discovered. We will carry the costs of an exploratory well as an asset if the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and as long as we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. For certain capital intensive deepwater Gulf of Mexico or international projects, it may take more than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability. Our ability to move forward on a project may be dependent on gaining access to transportation or processing facilities or obtaining permits and government or partner approval, the timing of which is beyond our control. In such cases, exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing access to necessary facilities and access to such permits and approvals and believe they will be obtained. Management assesses the status of suspended exploratory well costs on a quarterly basis. These costs may be charged to exploration expense in future periods if we decide not to pursue additional exploratory or development activities. At December 31, 2007, the balance of property, plant and equipment included $249 million of suspended exploratory well costs, $62 million of which had been capitalized for a period greater than one year. The wells relating to these suspended costs continue to be evaluated by various means including additional seismic work, drilling additional wells, or evaluating the potential of the exploration wells. For more information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 5Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs. Impairment of Proved Oil and Gas PropertiesWe assess proved crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss as a result of a triggering event and when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than the carrying value. If impairment is indicated, the cash flows are discounted at a rate approximate to our cost of capital and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. Estimated future cash flows are based on managements expectations for the future and include estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs. Downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate property impairment. We recorded approximately $4 million of impairments in 2007, primarily related to adjustment of the carrying value of properties to their fair values. Impairment of Unproved Oil and Gas PropertiesWe also perform periodic assessments of individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment. Cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon managements estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, future commodity prices and future costs to extract the reserves. Downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities, reductions in commodity prices, or increases in estimated costs could cause a reduction in the value of an unproved property and, therefore, could also cause a reduction in the carrying amounts of the property. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, indicating impairment, the cash flows are discounted at a rate approximate to our cost of capital and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. 26 The estimated prices used in the cash flow analysis are determined by management based on forward price curves for the related commodities, adjusted for average historical location and quality differentials. Estimates of cash flows related to probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk weighting factors. Due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices, these cash flow estimates are inherently imprecise. Managements assessment of the results of exploration activities, availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political climate in areas in which we operate also impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions. During 2007, we recorded impairments of significant unproved oil and gas properties totaling approximately $3 million in exploration expense. Asset Retirement ObligationOur asset retirement obligations (ARO) consist of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with our oil and gas properties. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO; estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements; the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used; and inflation rates. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through DD&A. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 6Asset Retirement Obligations. Involuntary ConversionsWhen an involuntary conversion occurs, such as the destruction of oil and gas producing assets by a hurricane, a loss is accrued by a charge to income if the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. An asset relating to insurance recovery is recognized only when realization of the claim for recovery of a loss recognized in the financial statements is deemed probable. A gain (recovery of a loss not yet recognized in the financial statements or an amount recovered in excess of a loss recognized in the financial statements) is not recognized until the insurance reimbursement has been received. Management must make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to these gain and loss accruals. These include estimated costs of salvage, clean up, restoration, redevelopment or abandonment and estimated amounts of insurance recoveries. The amount of an insurance recovery may be limited if total industry claims are in excess of the insurance carriers ceiling limitation per event. A significant amount of time may be necessary for an insurance carrier to review all related claims for an event and determine the company specific claim limitation on the final recovery. In addition, we may continue to incur costs, submit claims and receive reimbursements over a multi year period. The estimates involved in this process can have significant effects on reported amounts of net income. A decrease in the estimated amount of insurance recoveries will result in an increase in the involuntary conversion loss, which will result in a decrease in net income. An increase in estimated costs of salvage, if not covered by insurance, will also result in an increase in the involuntary conversion loss, which will result in a decrease in net income. Unreimbursed losses will have a negative effect on our cash flows. During the first half of 2007, several factors contributed to an increase in our estimated cleanup costs for damage related to Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina. These factors included cost escalation due to weather delays and an increase in effort for the design and construction of the deck lifting barge and mooring system, as well as additional costs for the actual deck lifting activities. These increases caused the total project costs, combined with net book value of the assets destroyed, to exceed certain insurance coverage limitations. As a result, we recorded $51 million as a loss on involuntary conversion during 2007. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 4Effect of Gulf Coast Hurricanes. Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesWe use various derivative instruments to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations on forecasted sales of crude oil and natural gas production. We also use derivative instruments in connection with purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to commodity price risk. In addition, we have used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties creditworthiness. We account for derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCL) until the hedged 27 forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings. Therefore, prior to settlement of the derivative instruments, changes in the fair market value of those derivative instruments can cause significant increases or decreases in AOCL. For derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported in current period net income and therefore can result in significant increases or decreases in current period net income. All hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the current period in net income. Ineffectiveness is the amount of gains or losses from derivative instruments which are not offset by corresponding and opposite gains or losses on the expected future transaction. Regression analysis is performed on initial assessment of the hedge and subsequently every quarter thereafter in order to determine that the hedge instrument will be or has been highly effective in offsetting gains or losses on the future transaction. As discussed in
