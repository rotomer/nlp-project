Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are an independent energy company engaged in worldwide crude oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production. We operate primarily in the Rocky Mountains, Mid continent, and deepwater Gulf of Mexico areas in the US, with key international operations offshore Israel, the North Sea and West Africa. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas. Our strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flows through the continued expansion of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is diversified among US and international projects; crude oil and natural gas; and near, medium and long term opportunities. Financial and Operating Results 2008 was a successful year for us as evidenced by our record earnings, cash flows provided by operating activities and production. We extended our acreage position both onshore and offshore US and pursued new exploration opportunities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international locations which led to significant new discoveries. We funded our capital program primarily with cash flows from operations and increased our ending cash balance. Our financial results included the following: net income of $1.4 billion, a 43% increase over 2007; $440 million gain on commodity derivative instruments; diluted earnings per share of $7.58, a 39% increase over 2007; cash flows provided by operating activities of $2.3 billion, a 13% increase over 2007; $294 million asset impairment charges; $38 million write down of receivable from Semcrude, L.P.; year end cash balance of $1.1 billion, a $480 million increase over the prior year ending cash balance; and year end ratio of debt to book capital of 26% as compared with 28% at December 31, 2007. Significant operational highlights included the following: significant oil discovery at the Gunflint prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; continued production growth in the Rocky Mountains area of our US operations; successful Benita oil appraisal well, offshore Equatorial Guinea; exploration discoveries offshore Equatorial Guinea at Diega and Felicita; start up of Phase 2 at the North Sea Dumbarton development; acquisition of producing properties in western Oklahoma; expanded acreage position onshore North America; successful appraisal of the South Raton discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; production start up at the Raton gas development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; new Ticonderoga development wells brought online in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; successful high bids on 15 deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease blocks in the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale; and record annual natural gas production in Israel of 139 MMcfpd. In addition, in January 2009, we announced a very significant natural gas discovery at the Tamar prospect offshore Israel. Impact of Recession and Current Credit and Commodity Markets The US and other world economies are currently in a recession which could last well into 2009 and beyond. Additionally, the credit markets are experiencing significant volatility, and many financial institutions have liquidity concerns, prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit markets. Our primary exposure to the current credit market crisis includes our revolving credit facility, cash investments and counterparty nonperformance risks. Our revolving credit facility is committed in the amount of $2.1 billion until December 2011, at which time it reduces to $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had $494 million available credit under the facility. If not extended, the credit facility matures in December 2012. Should current credit market tightening be prolonged for several years, future extensions of our credit facility may contain terms that are less favorable than those of our current credit facility. Current market conditions also elevate the concern over our cash investments, which total $1.1 billion, and counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit. With regard to our cash investments, we invest in highly liquid, investment grade securities, US Treasury securities and short term deposits with major financial institutions. In response to the credit market crisis, we have shortened the duration of our investment maturities and have increased our investments in US Treasury securities. 30 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net receivable position with a fair value of $445 million. We have all of our commodity derivative instruments with major financial institutions. Should one of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our derivative instruments under lower commodity prices and we could incur a loss. We sell our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. Some of these parties are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience liquidity problems. Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the way of parental guarantees or letters of credit, including from our largest international crude oil purchaser; however, we do not have all of our trade credit enhanced through guarantees or credit support. Nonperformance by a trade creditor could result in losses. In third quarter 2008, we reduced the carrying value of a receivable from SemCrude, L.P., a crude oil purchaser, and recognized a pre tax charge of $38 million for a probable loss. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies. Crude oil and natural gas prices are also volatile as evidenced by the significant decline during 2008 and into 2009. Continued lower commodity prices will reduce our cash flows from operations. To mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices on our cash flows, we have entered into crude oil and natural gas commodity contracts for 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Depending on the length of the current recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing a prolonged downturn, which would further reduce our cash flows from operations. This could cause us to alter our business plans including reducing or delaying our exploration and development program spending and other cost reduction initiatives. In addition, the following events impacted our business in 2008: Asset Impairments As a result of the depressed economic environment, coupled with a severe decrease in commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2008, we assessed the recoverability of our oil and gas properties and other investments. As a result of this analysis we determined that certain of our assets were impaired. In addition, during third quarter 2008, we initiated a process to sell our remaining operated non core Gulf of Mexico shelf asset at Main Pass and recorded an impairment loss (based on anticipated proceeds less costs to sell). For 2008, total pre tax (non cash) asset impairment charges totaled $294 million. See Critical Accounting Policies Impairment of Proved Oil and Gas Properties and Other Investments, and Impairment of Unproved Oil and Gas Properties. See also Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 3 Asset Impairments and Note 4 Acquisitions and DivestituresMain Pass Asset. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike In September, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike moved through the Gulf of Mexico. Inspection of our facilities and equipment indicated there was no major damage from the hurricanes, although damage to third party processing and pipeline facilities has slowed reinstatement of production from our Gulf of Mexico assets, including Lorien and Ticonderoga. Temporary shut ins of production reduced volumes on average 7.2 MBoepd during third quarter 2008 and 9.0 MBoepd during fourth quarter 2008. Approximately 8.5 MBoepd of our Gulf of Mexico production remained shut in at December 31, 2008. We expect production to resume during the first half of 2009, pending the successful resumption of pipeline and other non operated facilities. Mid continent Acquisition In July 2008, we acquired producing properties in western Oklahoma for $292 million in cash. Properties acquired cover approximately 15,500 net acres and are currently producing a net 20 MMcfepd with approximately 70% natural gas and 30% liquids. We operate the assets with an average working interest of 83%. Sale of Argentina Assets In February 2008, effective July 1, 2007, we sold our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million. The sale is subject to Argentine government approval, which has not been received. Accordingly, the gain on sale of approximately $24 million has been deferred. We are currently unable to predict when government approval will be obtained. 2009 OUTLOOK We expect the mid point of our 2009 crude oil, natural gas and NGL production to be slightly above our 2008 results. The expected year over year change in production is impacted by several factors including: the amount of development capital expenditures; higher sales of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea; growth in demand for natural gas in Israel; and growing production from our Rocky Mountains assets, where we are continuing an active drilling program; offset by natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid continent areas of our US operations. 31 Table of Contents Factors potentially impacting our expected production profile include: overall level and timing of capital expenditures, as discussed below, which, dependent upon our drilling success, are expected to result in near term production growth; potential hurricane related volume curtailments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas of our US operations as occurred with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike; the restoration of pipeline and facilities necessary to increase our Gulf of Mexico production; potential winter storm related volume curtailments in the Northern region of our US operations; potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountains area of our US operations and timing of start up of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system which will run from Weld County, Colorado to Cushing, Oklahoma; deliveries of Egyptian gas in Israel, which could lower our sales volumes; potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and or LNG plants in Equatorial Guinea; seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect our natural gas to power project; and timing of significant project completion and initial production. 2009 BudgetDue to the uncertain economic and commodity price environment, we have designed a flexible capital spending program that will be responsive to conditions that develop during 2009. Our preliminary base capital program for 2009 will accommodate an investment level similar to our original 2008 program which was $1.6 billion. However, depending on commodity prices and other economic conditions we experience in the first half of 2009, this base capital program may be adjusted up or down by approximately 10% to 15%. Approximately 40% of the 2009 budget is committed to longer term projects that will provide considerable production growth several years in the future. The remainder is allocated toward maintaining and strengthening the existing property base. Development spending will focus on our international and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets as well as certain higher return opportunities onshore in the US. The exploration budget will center on significant resource potential in Israel, West Africa and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. International expenditures are estimated to represent 30% of the total capital program. The 2009 budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases. We expect that the 2009 budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and or other financing. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations and property acquisitions and divestitures. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Net income for 2008 was $1.4 billion, a 43% increase over 2007. Factors contributing to the increase in net income included the following: $629 million, or 19%, increase in total revenues, due primarily to higher commodity prices; and $440 million gain on derivative instruments; offset by: $294 million impairment of assets; $106 million increase in total production costs; $55 million increase in DD&A expense; and $38 million write down of receivable from Semcrude, L.P. Net income for 2007 was $944 million, a 39% increase over 2006. Factors contributing to the increase in net income from 2006 to 2007 included the following: $332 million, or 11%, increase in total revenues, due primarily to higher average realized commodity prices and an increase in income from equity method investees; and $394 million decrease in loss on derivative instruments; offset by: $208 million decrease in gains from asset sales; $103 million increase in DD&A expense; $51 million loss on involuntary conversion expense; and $51 million increase in oil and gas exploration expense. 32 Table of Contents Discontinuance of Cash Flow Hedge Accounting Effective January 1, 2008, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on all existing commodity contracts (or commodity derivative instruments). We voluntarily made this change to provide greater flexibility in our use of derivative instruments. From January 1, 2008 forward, we recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. The discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting for commodity derivative instruments has no impact on our net assets or cash flows and previously reported amounts have not been adjusted. However, the use of mark to market accounting adds volatility to our net income. Net income for 2008 included a $440 million gain on commodity derivative instruments, of which $82 million was a pre tax realized loss, and $522 million was a pre tax, unrealized, non cash gain due to the change in the mark to market value of our commodity contracts related to production in future periods. Unrealized mark to market gains or losses recognized in the current period will be realized in the future when they are cash settled in the month that the related production occurs. The amount of gain or loss actually realized may be more or less than the amount of unrealized mark to market gain or loss previously reported. Oil, Gas and NGL Sales Revenues from sales of commodities were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Crude oil and condensate sales $ 2,101 $ 1,694 $ 1,489 Natural gas sales 1,375 1,272 1,212 NGL sales (1) 175 Total $ 3,651 $ 2,966 $ 2,701 (1) For 2007 and 2006, US NGL sales volumes were included with natural gas volumes. Effective in 2008, we began reporting US NGLs separately, which has lowered the comparative natural gas sales revenues from 2007 to 2008. 33 Table of Contents Average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices were as follows: Sales Volumes Average Realized Sales Prices Crude Oil & Natural Crude Oil & Natural Condensate Gas (1) NGLs (1) Condensate Gas (1) NGLs (1) (MBopd) (MMcfpd) (MBpd) (Per Bbl) (Per Mcf) (Per Bbl) Year Ended December 31, 2008 United States (2) 40 395 9 $ 75.53 $ 8.12 $ 50.15 West Africa (3) 15 206 88.95 0.27 North Sea 10 5 100.56 10.54 Israel 139 3.10 Ecuador (4) 22 Other International 4 82.66 Total Consolidated Operations 69 767 9 82.60 5.04 50.15 Equity Investees (5) 2 6 96.77 58.81 Total 71 767 15 $ 82.96 $ 5.04 $ 53.45 Year Ended December 31, 2007 United States (2) 42 412 $ 53.22 $ 7.51 $ West Africa (3) 15 132 71.27 0.29 North Sea 13 6 76.47 6.54 Israel 111 2.79 Ecuador (4) 26 Other International 7 53.69 Total Consolidated Operations 77 687 60.61 5.26 Equity Investees (5) 2 6 74.87 48.87 Total 79 687 6 $ 60.94 $ 5.26 $ 48.87 Year Ended December 31, 2006 United States (2) 46 452 $ 50.68 $ 6.61 $ West Africa (3) 18 45 62.51 0.37 North Sea 4 8 67.43 8.00 Israel 93 2.72 Ecuador (4) 25 Other International 7 52.05 Total Consolidated Operations 75 623 54.47 5.55 Equity Investees (5) 2 6 66.60 40.10 Total 77 623 6 $ 54.75 $ 5.55 $ 40.10 (1) For 2007 and 2006, US NGL sales volumes were included with natural gas volumes. Effective in 2008, we began reporting US NGLs separately, which has lowered the comparative natural gas sales volumes from 2007 to 2008. (2) Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect reductions of $22.06 per Bbl for 2008, $13.68 per Bbl for 2007, and $11.41 per Bbl for 2006 from hedging activities. Average realized natural gas prices reflect increases of $0.23 per Mcf for 2008 and $1.12 per Mcf for 2007, and a reduction of $0.25 per Mcf for 2006 from hedging activities. The price increases and reductions resulted from hedge gains and losses that had been previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCL). (3) Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect reductions of $7.59 per Bbl for 2008 and $2.19 per Bbl for 2007 from hedging activities. The price reductions resulted from hedge losses that had been previously deferred in AOCL. We did not hedge West Africa crude oil sales in 2006. Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Natural gas volumes sold to the LNG plant totaled 163 MMcfpd in 2008 and 78 MMcfpd in 2007. The natural gas sold to the LNG and methanol plants has a lower Btu content than the natural gas sold to the LPG plant. As a result of the increase in natural gas volumes sold to the LNG plant to 2008, the average price received on an Mcf basis is lower. (4) The natural gas to power project in Ecuador is 100% owned by our subsidiaries and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales are included in other revenues. See Electricity Sales below. (5) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. See Equity Method Investees below. 34 Table of Contents Crude oil and condensate sales volumes in the table above may differ from actual production volumes due to the timing of liquid hydrocarbon tanker liftings. Crude oil and condensate production volumes were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (MBopd) United States 40 42 46 West Africa 14 15 17 North Sea 10 13 4 Other International 4 7 8 Total Consolidated Operations 68 77 75 Equity Investees 2 2 2 Total 70 79 77 If the realized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, which are included in (gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments, had been included in oil and gas revenues, average realized prices would have been as follows: Year Ended December 31,2008 (1) Crude Oil & Natural Condensate Gas (Per Bbl) (Per Mcf) United States $ 71.68 $ 8.05 West Africa 85.98 0.27 Total Consolidated Operations 79.75 5.00 Total 80.19 5.00 (1) In 2007 and 2006 we applied cash flow hedge accounting. Crude Oil and Condensate Sales 2008 Compared with 2007 Crude oil sales increased a net $407 million, or 24%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The increase was affected by both volume and price changes. In the US, crude oil sales increased by $286 million due to higher average realized prices. Sales volumes declined due to hurricane related production shut ins in the Gulf of Mexico from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and declining production in the Gulf Coast onshore and Mid continent areas of our US operations, offset by growth in the Rocky Mountains area of our US operations. Internationally, West Africa crude oil sales increased $88 million due to higher average realized prices. North Sea crude oil sales increased $39 million due to higher average realized prices, while sales volumes were affected by natural field decline. Other international crude oil sales decreased $6 million primarily due to natural field decline in China. Fourth quarter 2008 crude oil sales were significantly impacted by declining prices. Our average realized crude oil prices were $33.16 per Bbl for the US and $43.80 per Bbl for total consolidated operations for fourth quarter 2008. 2007 Compared with 2006Crude oil sales increased a net $205 million, or 14%, in 2007 as compared with 2006. The increase was affected by both volume and price changes. In the US, crude oil sales declined by $25 million from the previous year. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico volumes were lower due to well performance, third party facility restrictions and storm related shut ins. The Gulf Coast onshore area had lower production due to natural field decline, and a loss of production from the sale of our significant Gulf of Mexico shelf properties in 2006. Northern region production was negatively impacted by severe winter weather in the Rocky Mountains in the first and fourth quarters of 2007. However, development activity in the Wattenberg field, as well as a full year of production from U.S. Exploration properties acquired in 2006, resulted in increased production in our Northern region. The overall US volume decline was partially offset by higher average realized prices. 35 Table of Contents Internationally, West Africa crude oil sales declined by $15 million from the previous year. Volumes declined due to increased downtime and lower condensate yields in Equatorial Guinea, but the decline was offset by substantially higher average realized crude oil prices. In January 2007, production began at the Dumbarton development in the North Sea, and, as a result, crude oil production was more than triple that of the prior year. North Sea crude oil sales increased $257 million over 2006 due to the increased volumes and, to a lesser extent, higher average realized prices. Other international crude oil sales declined $12 million. China experienced lower volumes due to facility downtime and natural field decline. Crude oil sales include amounts reclassified from AOCL related to commodity derivative instruments which were accounted for as cash flow hedges through December 31, 2007. Amounts included decreases of $365 million in 2008, $223 million in 2007, and $191 million in 2006. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 6Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Natural Gas Sales 2008 Compared with 2007Natural gas sales increased a net $103 million, or 8%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The increase was affected by both volume and price changes. In the US, natural gas sales increased $44 million primarily due to higher commodity prices despite lower sales volumes. Lower volumes were the result of several factors including hurricane related production shut ins in the Gulf of Mexico from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, reduction for shrink gas associated with the natural gas liquids now being reported separately, and declining production in the Gulf Coast onshore and Mid continent areas of our US operations. The volume decline was offset by a successful drilling program in the Piceance basin along with less severe winter weather in the Rocky Mountains area of our US operations. Internationally, West Africa gas sales increased $6 million from the previous year. Natural gas volumes were higher due to increased sales of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea; however, the effect of higher production was somewhat offset by lower average realized gas prices. In the North Sea, sales increased $6 million primarily due to higher average realized prices. In Israel, natural gas sales increased $44 million due to record sales volumes, which included the commencement of sales to the IEC power plant at Gezer, and higher average realized prices. Fourth quarter 2008 natural gas sales were significantly impacted by declining prices. Our average realized natural gas prices were $5.30 per Mcf for the US and $3.62 per Mcf for total consolidated operations for fourth quarter 2008. 2007 Compared with 2006Natural gas sales increased a net $60 million, or 5%, in 2007 as compared with 2006. The increase was affected by both volume and price changes. In the US, natural gas sales increased $40 million from the previous year despite lower sales volumes. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico volumes were slightly higher than 2006, while development activity in the Piceance basin and a full year of production from U.S. Exploration properties acquired in 2006 resulted in increased production in the Northern region. However, the Gulf Coast onshore area had lower production due to natural field decline, and there was a loss of production due to the sale of our significant Gulf of Mexico shelf properties in 2006. The Northern region also experienced a temporary decline in production due to third party processing downtime and inclement weather. The net production decrease was more than offset by a 14% increase in average realized natural gas prices. Internationally, West Africa natural gas sales increased $8 million from the previous year. Natural gas volumes were higher due to increased sales of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea; however, the effect of higher production was somewhat offset by lower average realized gas prices. In the North Sea, natural gas production decreased 23% as compared with the prior year primarily due to natural field decline. Lower production, combined with lower average realized prices, resulted in a $9 million decrease in North Sea natural gas sales. In Israel, natural gas sales increased $21 million due to record sales volumes. There was a full year of sales to the IEC Reading power plant in Tel Aviv, as well as the start up of sales to a desalinization plant and a paper mill. Natural gas revenues include amounts reclassified from AOCL related to commodity derivative instruments which were accounted for as cash flow hedges through December 31, 2007. Amounts included increases of $34 million in 2008 and $169 million in 2007, and a decrease of $41 million in 2006. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 6Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 36 Table of Contents NGL Sales Effective in 2008, we began reporting US NGL sales separately. This has lowered the comparative natural gas sales volumes and revenues from 2007 to 2008. Most of our US NGL production is from the Wattenberg field and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Income from Equity Method Investees We have a 45% interest in AMPCO, which owns and operates a methanol plant and related facilities. We also have a 28% interest in Alba Plant, which owns and operates an LPG processing plant. The plants and related facilities are located in Equatorial Guinea. We account for investments in entities that we do not control but over which we exert significant influence using the equity method of accounting. Our share of operations of equity method investees was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income (in millions, except as noted) AMPCO and affiliates $ 56 $ 83 $ 38 Alba Plant 118 128 101 Distributions/dividends AMPCO and affiliates 65 97 37 Alba Plant 156 132 151 Sales volumes Methanol (MMgal) (1) 119 161 110 Condensate (MBopd) 2 2 2 LPG (MBpd) 6 6 6 Production volumes Methanol (MMgal) (1) 116 163 109 Condensate (MBopd) 2 2 2 LPG (MBpd) 6 6 6 Average realized prices Methanol (per gallon) $ 1.25 $ 1.09 $ 0.90 Condensate (per Bbl) 96.77 74.87 66.60 LPG (per Bbl) 58.81 48.87 40.10 (1) The variance between methanol production and sales volumes is attributable to managements decision to increase or decrease inventory. AMPCO and Affiliates Net income from AMPCO and affiliates decreased $27 million, or 33%, in 2008 as compared with 2007 due to decreases in methanol sales volumes that resulted from 95 days of down time for compressor and other equipment repair and maintenance. The decreases in methanol sales volumes were offset by higher average realized methanol prices. Net income from AMPCO and affiliates increased substantially in 2007 as compared with 2006 due to increases in methanol sales volumes and average realized methanol prices. The increase in methanol sales volumes was due to a 57 day shutdown of methanol production for the plant turnaround that occurred during May and June 2006 followed by 35 days of compressor repairs. Alba PlantNet income from Alba Plant decreased $10 million, or 8%, in 2008 as compared with 2007 primarily due to the expiration of the Alba Plant tax holiday, offset by higher average realized condensate and LPG prices. Net income from Alba Plant increased $27 million, or 27%, in 2007 as compared with 2006 due to increases in average realized condensate and LPG prices. Our operating cash flows include dividends received from Alba Plant of $156 million in 2008 and $132 million in 2007. In 2006, distributions received from Alba Plant were classified within investing cash flows as a repayment of a loan. The change in classification was the result of all outstanding loans being repaid to us by Alba Plant in December 2006. Other Revenues Other revenues include electricity sales and gathering, marketing and processing revenues. See Electricity Sales below. See also Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 37 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses Production CostsProduction costs were as follows: United West North Other Intl/ Total States Africa Sea Israel Corporate (1) (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Oil and gas operating costs (2) $ 333 $ 222 $ 39 $ 50 $ 9 $ 13 Workover and repair expense 38 35 3 Lease operating expense 371 257 39 53 9 13 Production and ad valorem taxes 166 135 31 Transportation expense 57 49 7 1 Total production costs $ 594 $ 441 $ 39 $ 60 $ 9 $ 45 Year Ended December 31, 2007 Oil and gas operating costs (2) $ 299 $ 190 $ 39 $ 38 $ 8 $ 24 Workover and repair expense 23 23 Lease operating expense 322 213 39 38 8 24 Production and ad valorem taxes 114 91 23 Transportation expense 52 40 11 1 Total production costs $ 488 $ 344 $ 39 $ 49 $ 8 $ 48 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Oil and gas operating costs (2) $ 270 $ 205 $ 27 $ 12 $ 9 $ 17 Workover and repair expense 47 47 Lease operating expense 317 252 27 12 9 17 Production and ad valorem taxes 109 86 23 Transportation expense 29 21 7 1 Total production costs $ 455 $ 359 $ 27 $ 19 $ 9 $ 41 (1) Other international includes Ecuador, China and Argentina (through February 2008). (2) Oil and gas operating costs include labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs and exclude depreciation of support equipment and facilities such as vehicles. Oil and gas operating costs increased $34 million, or 11%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The increase is primarily the result of higher costs related to the continuing active drilling program in the Rocky Mountains and Mid continent areas of our US operations. North Sea oil and gas operating costs increased due to expanded operations and higher costs at the Dumbarton development. Oil and gas operating costs increased $29 million, or 11%, in 2007 as compared with 2006. The increase was primarily the result of expanded operations in Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea. Workover and repair expense increased $15 million, or 65%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The increase was primarily due to increased workover activity in the Piceance basin, Wattenberg field, and Mid continent and Gulf Coast areas of our US operations. Workover and repair expense decreased $24 million, or 51%, in 2007 as compared with 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in hurricane related repair expense, which totaled $30 million in 2006 and $1 million in 2007. Production and ad valorem tax expense increased $52 million, or 46%, in 2008 as compared with 2007, and increased $5 million, or 5%, in 2007 as compared with 2006. The increases were driven primarily by higher commodity prices and also by an increase in volumes subject to such taxes, mainly in the Northern region of our US operations. Transportation expense increased $5 million, or 10%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. The increase was due primarily to higher natural gas production in the Wattenberg field and increased production from the Swordfish development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 38 Table of Contents Transportation expense increased $23 million, or 79%, in 2007 as compared with 2006. The increase was due primarily due to changes in the terms of certain sales contracts for Northern region production and increased production in the North Sea. Selected expenses on a per BOE of sales volume basis were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Oil and gas operating costs $ 4.39 $ 4.29 $ 4.14 Workover and repair expense 0.51 0.33 0.72 Lease operating costs 4.90 4.62 4.86 Production and ad valorem taxes 2.19 1.63 1.67 Transportation expense 0.75 0.74 0.44 Total production costs (1) $ 7.84 $ 6.99 $ 6.97 (1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea that began late first quarter of 2007. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.19 per BOE for 2008 and $0.51 per BOE for 2007. The unit rates of total production costs per BOE have been increasing year over year since 2006. The increases are due to rising third party costs, higher production taxes and increased workover activity in the Piceance basin, Wattenberg field, and Mid continent and Gulf Coast areas of our US operations. Oil and Gas Exploration ExpenseExploration expense was as follows: United West North Other Intl/ Total States Africa Sea Israel Corporate (1) (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Dry hole expense $ 84 $ 42 $ 1 $ 8 $ $ 33 Seismic 57 50 4 3 Staff expense 62 14 7 5 1 35 Other 14 13 1 Total exploration expense $ 217 $ 119 $ 8 $ 18 $ 4 $ 68 Year Ended December 31, 2007 Dry hole expense $ 90 $ 50 $ 40 $ $ $ Seismic 65 55 1 8 1 Staff expense 46 12 2 9 1 22 Other 18 17 1 Total exploration expense $ 219 $ 134 $ 43 $ 17 $ 2 $ 23 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Dry hole expense $ 70 $ 66 $ $ 4 $ $ Seismic 38 29 4 1 4 Staff expense 39 13 3 5 18 Other 21 20 1 Total exploration expense $ 168 $ 128 $ 7 $ 11 $ $ 22 (1) Other international includes Ecuador, China, Argentina (through February 2008), Suriname and other international new ventures. Exploration expense was flat in 2008 as compared with 2007. Dry hole expense in 2008 related to exploratory drilling in Suriname ($33 million), the deepwater Gulf of Mexico ($35 million), the North Sea ($8 million), and other onshore US areas ($7 million). Exploration expense increased $51 million, or 30%, in 2007 as compared with 2006. US dry hole expense decreased $16 million due to a reduction in the number of dry holes drilled in 2007. Dry hole expense increased $40 million in West Africa and included amounts related to a dry exploratory well in Equatorial Guinea and expense related to a secondary target of an exploration well in Cameroon. Seismic expense increased a net $27 million in 2007 as compared with 2006, primarily due to increases in US seismic expense incurred in support of the 2007 central Gulf of Mexico outer continental shelf sale. Staff expense increased a net $7 million primarily due to new venture activity. 39 Table of Contents Exploration expense included stock based compensation expense of $1 million in 2008, $2 million in 2007 and $1 million in 2006. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ExpenseDepreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) United States $ 646 $ 580 $ 552 West Africa 34 25 24 North Sea 55 81 9 Israel 24 18 14 Other international, corporate, and other 32 32 34 Total DD&A expense (1) $ 791 $ 736 $ 633 Unit rate of DD&A per BOE (2) $ 10.44 $ 10.55 $ 9.71 (1) DD&A expense includes accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations of $10 million in 2008, $8 million in 2007, and $11 million in 2006. (2) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea that began late first quarter of 2007. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.29 per BOE for 2008 and $0.63 per BOE for 2007. Total DD&A expense increased in 2008 as compared with 2007 due to several factors including higher acquisition and or development costs in the Wattenberg field and other Rocky Mountain and Mid continent areas in the US, negative year end reserve revisions in the US due to lower commodity prices, and higher natural gas sales volumes in Israel and West Africa, offset by declining production in the North Sea. Total DD&A expense increased in 2007 as compared with 2006 primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes in the North Sea due to start up of the Dumbarton development, higher natural gas sales volumes in Israel and West Africa and higher acquisition and or development costs in the North Sea and in the Wattenberg field and deepwater Gulf of Mexico in the US. The decrease in the unit rate for 2008 as compared with 2007 is due to a change in the mix of production. Increased production of lower cost natural gas volumes from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea and Israel were partially offset by increased production from areas with higher acquisition and or development costs (the Wattenberg field and other Rocky Mountain and Mid continent areas in the US) and negative year end reserve revisions in the US due to lower commodity prices. The increase in the unit rate for 2007 as compared with 2006 was primarily due to higher acquisition and development costs in the US and the North Sea Dumbarton development. DD&A expense includes abandoned assets cost of $5 million in 2007 and $1 million in 2006. There was no abandoned asset cost in 2008. General and Administrative ExpenseGeneral and administrative (G&A) expense was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 G&A expense (in millions) $ 236 $ 206 $ 165 Unit rate per BOE (1) $ 3.12 $ 2.96 $ 2.52 (1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea that began late first quarter of 2007. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $0.47 per BOE for 2008 and $0.21 per BOE for 2007. G&A expense increased $30 million, or 15%, in 2008 as compared with 2007. Our increased activities require additional personnel, which has resulted in higher payroll costs. We have also increased our incentive compensation accruals. 40 Table of Contents G&A expense increased $41 million, or 25%, in 2007 as compared with 2006 due to higher salaries and wages, including incentive compensation programs, resulting from an increase in the number of employees and results exceeding targeted performance goals. In addition, the amount of stock based compensation expense included in G&A has been increasing since the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment in 2006 combined with additional equity based awards. Stock based compensation expense included in G&A totaled $38 million in 2008, $25 million in 2007 and $11 million in 2006. G&A also includes actuarially computed net periodic benefit cost related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $17 million in 2008, $17 million in 2007, and $19 million in 2006. Impairment of AssetsDuring 2008, we recorded total pre tax (non cash) impairment charges of $294 million primarily due to lower commodity prices at year end. We recorded impairments of $4 million in 2007 and $9 million in 2006, primarily related to downward reserve revisions on proved US oil and gas properties and or adjustment of the carrying value of properties to their fair values.
