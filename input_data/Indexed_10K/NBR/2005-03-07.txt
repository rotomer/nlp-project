Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Gas. OTHER SERVICES. Our Canrig drilling technologies subsidiary manufactures top drives, which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. Our top drives are marketed throughout the world. During the last three years, approximately 45% of our top drive sales were made to other Nabors companies. We also rent top drives and provide top drive installation, repair and maintenance services to our customers. Our EPOCH well services subsidiary offers rig instrumentation equipment, including sensors, proprietary RIGWATCH(TM) software and computerized equipment that monitors the real time performance of a rig. In addition, EPOCH specializes in daily reporting software for drilling operations, making this data available through the internet via mywells.com. EPOCH also provides mudlogging services. Our Ryan Energy Technologies subsidiary manufactures and sells directional drilling and rig instrumentation and data collection services to oil and gas exploration and service companies. Nabors has a 50% interest in Peak Oilfield Services Company, a general partnership with a subsidiary of Cook Inlet Region, Inc., a leading Alaskan native corporation. Peak Oilfield Services provides heavy equipment to move drilling rigs, water, other fluids and construction materials, primarily on Alaskas North Slope and in the Cook Inlet region. The partnership also provides construction and maintenance for ice roads, pads, facilities, equipment, drill sites and pipelines. Our Peak USA subsidiary provides hauling and maintenance services for customers in the U.S. Lower 48. We time charter a fleet of 33 offshore support vessels, including one crew boat, which operate in the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and the Middle East and provide marine transportation of drilling materials, supplies and crews for offshore rig operations and support for other offshore facilities. The supply vessels are used as freight carrying vessels for bringing drill pipe, tubing, casing, drilling mud and other equipment to drilling rigs and production platforms. 4 OUR EMPLOYEES. As of December 31, 2004, Nabors employed approximately 19,776 persons, of whom approximately 2,516 were employed by unconsolidated affiliates. We believe our relationship with our employees generally is good. On October 18, 2000, the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB") confirmed the selection of a collective bargaining representative at our Alaska drilling subsidiary. The unit covers most non supervisory drilling and related field personnel working on or about our rigs within the State of Alaska. Negotiations with the union commenced during 2000; an agreement was reached with representatives of the union in December 2002; was submitted to the union membership for ratification; and was rejected by the membership in the first quarter 2003. We anticipate that the continuation of a collective bargaining unit at our Alaska drilling subsidiary will not have any material adverse impact on the operations of that entity or Nabors as a whole. During the first quarter 2003 the NLRB commenced a suit asserting that our subsidiary committed an unfair labor practice in failing to adequately bargain with the collective bargaining representative in connection with a change in Nabors medical insurance program. The administrative law judge who heard the case ruled in Nabors favor and the matter was appealed to an appeals panel of the NLRB, which affirmed the judges ruling. The matter was not further appealed and is now concluded. On February 10, 2004, the Alaska State District Council of Laborers filed a charge with the NLRB alleging that our subsidiary committed an unfair labor practice by threatening certain employees for the purpose of inducing them to alter a Pro Active Safety Report. That charge since has been withdrawn. On January 27, 2005, the Alaska State District Council of Laborers filed a charge with the NLRB alleging that our subsidiary committed an unfair labor practice by denying an employee representation during an interview in connection with an investigation into allegations made by the employee of certain misconduct by others. Nabors denies the allegations, believes that it has meritorious defenses and further believes that the outcome of the dispute will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain rig employees in Argentina and Australia are represented by collective bargaining units. SEASONALITY. Our Canadian and Alaskan drilling and workover operations are subject to seasonal variations as a result of weather conditions and generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second calendar quarter of each year. Seasonality does not have a material impact on the remaining portions of our business. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in our Canadian and Alaskan operations. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development does not constitute a material part of our overall business. However, technology is of growing importance to our business and management expects to maintain its competitive position technologically with the internal development of technology or through strategic acquisitions. INDUSTRY/COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS. To a large degree, Nabors businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. A sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities by our customers and could also affect materially our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See "Risk Factors Fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and Nabors revenues, cash flows and profitability." Our industry remains competitive. The number of rigs continues to exceed demand in many of our markets, resulting in strong price competition. Many rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, which may result in an oversupply of rigs in such areas. Many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. The land drilling, workover and well servicing market is generally more competitive than the offshore market due to the larger number of rigs and market participants. In all of our geographic market areas, we believe price and availability and condition of equipment are the most significant factors in determining which drilling contractor is awarded a job. Other factors include the availability of trained personnel possessing the required specialized skills; the overall quality of service and safety record; and domestically, the ability to offer ancillary services. In international markets, experience in operating in certain environments and customer alliances also have been factors in the selection of Nabors. 5 Certain competitors are present in more than one of Nabors operating regions, although no one competitor operates in all of these areas. In the U.S. Lower 48 states, there are several hundred competitors with smaller national, regional or local rig operations. In domestic land workover and well servicing, we compete with Key Energy Services, Inc. and with numerous other competitors having smaller regional or local rig operations. In Canada and offshore, Nabors competes with many firms of varying size, several of which have more significant operations in those areas than Nabors. Internationally, Nabors competes directly with various contractors at each location where it operates. Nabors believes that the market for land drilling, workover and well servicing contracts will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future. Our other operating segments represent a relatively smaller part of our business, and we have numerous competitors in each area. Our Canrig subsidiary is one of the six major manufacturers of top drives. Its largest competitors are Varco, Tesco and National Oilwell. EPOCHs largest competitor in the manufacture of rig instrumentation systems is Varcos Totco subsidiary. Mudlogging services are provided by a number of entities that serve the oil and gas industry on a regional basis. EPOCH competes for mudlogging customers with Sperry Sun and Baker Hughes in the Gulf Coast region, California and Alaska. In the U.S. Lower 48 states, there are hundreds of rig transportation companies, and there are at least three or four that compete with Peak USA in each of its operating regions. In Alaska, Peak Oilfield Services principally competes with Alaska Petroleum Contractors for road, pad and pipeline maintenance, and is one of many drill site and road construction companies, the largest of which is VECO Corporation. OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. Since 1987, with the installation of our current management team, Nabors has adhered to a consistent strategy aimed at positioning our company to grow and prosper in good times and to mitigate adverse effects during periods of poor market conditions. We have continued to strive to attain a financial posture that would allow us to capitalize on market weakness by adding to our business base, thereby enhancing our upside potential at reasonable costs. The principal elements of our strategy have been to: Maintain flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet. Build cost effectively a base of premium assets. Build and maintain low operating costs through economies of scale. Develop and maintain long term, mutually attractive relationships with key customers and vendors. Build a diverse business in long term, sustainable and worthwhile geographic markets. Recognize and seize opportunities as they arise. Continually improve safety, quality and efficiency. Implement leading edge technology where cost effective to do so. Our business strategy is designed to allow us to grow and remain profitable in any market environment. The major developments in our business in the past year illustrate our implementation of this strategy and its continuing success. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10 K, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. FLUCTUATIONS IN OIL AND GAS PRICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DRILLING ACTIVITY AND OUR REVENUES, CASH FLOWS AND PROFITABILITY Our operations are materially dependent upon the level of activity in oil and gas exploration and production. Both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices affect the level of such activity. Oil and gas prices and, therefore, the level of drilling, exploration and production activity can be volatile. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and gas. We believe that any prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would depress the level of exploration and production activity. This would likely result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Lower oil and gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor our drilling contracts; affect the fair market value of our rig fleet which in turn could trigger a write down for accounting purposes; affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel; and affect 6 our ability to obtain access to capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and gas and oilfield services industries. WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY WITH EXCESS DRILLING CAPACITY, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The oilfield services industry in which we operate is very competitive. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Many drilling, workover and well servicing rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and provided market conditions warrant, which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area. In many markets in which we operate, the number of rigs available for use exceeds the demand for rigs, resulting in price competition. Most drilling and workover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. The land drilling market generally is more competitive than the offshore drilling market because there are larger numbers of rigs and competitors. THE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS PRESENTS INHERENT RISKS OF LOSS THAT, IF NOT INSURED OR INDEMNIFIED AGAINST, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well servicing industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations are also subject to the hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. In addition, our international operations are subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events. Generally, drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer, and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements, we seek protection through insurance. However, there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that it will be adequate or that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make such insurance prohibitive. It is likely that we will face continued upward pressure in our upcoming insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible. We expect that we may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize the effect of insurance premium increases. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY WAR, CIVIL DISTURBANCE OR POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC TURMOIL We derive a significant portion of our business from international markets, including major operations in Canada, the Middle East, the Far East and South and Central America. These operations are subject to various risks, including the risk of war, civil disturbances and governmental activities that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In certain countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. In the international markets in which we operate, we are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. CHANGES TO OR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OR EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. Our cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial. For example, federal law imposes a variety of regulations on "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and transportation equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, our well servicing, workover and production services operations routinely involve the 7 handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous substances. Our operations and facilities are subject to numerous state and federal environmental laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks and the use of underground injection wells. We generally require customers to contractually assume responsibility for compliance with environmental regulations. However, we are not always successful in allocating to customers all of these risks nor is there any assurance that the customer will be financially able to bear those risks assumed. We employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use outside experts to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts. Liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Laws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent than in the past and are expected to continue to become more so. Violation of environmental laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations; and in some cases injunctive relief. Such violations could also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property damage, and other costs and claims. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or Superfund, and related state laws and regulations, liability can be imposed jointly on the entire group of responsible parties or separately on any one of the responsible parties, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Changes in federal and state environmental regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress which would reclassify certain oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling, disposal and clean up requirements. If enacted, such legislation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making many wells and or oilfields uneconomical to operate. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, contains provisions specifying responsibility for removal costs and damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters or onto the adjoining shorelines. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Because our offshore support vessel operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production, if the government were to exercise its authority under this law to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases, such an action could have a material adverse effect on our offshore support vessel operations. It is possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties) could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization, depending on any responsive action taken by us. RECENT LEGISLATION COULD CURTAIL OUR ABILITY TO TIME CHARTER VESSELS IN U.S. COASTWISE TRADE Our Sea Mar division time charters supply vessels to offshore operators in U.S. waters. The vessels are owned by one of our financing company subsidiaries, but are operated and managed by a U.S. citizen controlled company pursuant to long term bareboat charters. As a result of recent legislation, beginning in August 2007 Sea Mar will no longer be able to use this arrangement to qualify vessels for employment in the U.S. coastwise trade. Accordingly, we will be required to restructure the arrangement, redeploy the vessels outside the United States, or sell the vessels by no later than such time. As of December 31, 2004, the net assets of Sea Mar totaled approximately $159.8 million. During 2004 Sea Mar had income before income taxes totaling $2.3 million. AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE DEPEND ON OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans made by us to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that 8 our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay upstream dividends or cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of their intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements which may contractually restrict or prohibit such upstream payments to us. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with making dividend payments upstream. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS We have not paid any cash dividends on our common shares since 1982. Nabors does not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on its common shares. However, we note that there have been recent positive industry trends and changes in tax law providing more favorable treatment of dividends. As a result, we can give no assurance that we will not reevaluate our position on dividends in the future. BECAUSE OUR OPTION, WARRANT AND CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES HOLDERS HAVE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AND RESALE, SIGNIFICANT ISSUANCES OR RESALES IN THE FUTURE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES As of February 28, 2005, we had 400,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 150,423,275 shares were outstanding. In addition, 34,410,812 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to option and employee benefit plans, and 18,476,525 shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures and zero coupon senior exchangeable notes. In addition, up to 216,149 of our common shares could be issuable on exchange of the shares of Nabors Exchangeco (Canada) Inc. We also may sell up to $700 million of securities of various types in connection with a shelf registration statement declared effective on January 16, 2003 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of warrants or options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144) or the conversion into common shares, or repurchase of debentures and notes using common shares, would be dilutive to existing security holders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. PROVISIONS OF OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS MAY DETER A CHANGE OF CONTROL TRANSACTION AND DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SHAREHOLDER RECEIVING A CHANGE OF CONTROL PREMIUM Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving a staggered three year term. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue a significant amount of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without further vote or action by the holders of the common shares. Although we have no present plans to issue preferred shares, the classified board and our boards ability to issue additional preferred shares may discourage, delay or prevent changes in control of Nabors that are not supported by our board, thereby possibly preventing certain of our shareholders from realizing a possible premium on their shares. In addition, the requirement in the indenture for Series B of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due 2023 to pay a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the exchange rate in certain circumstances could have the effect of making a change in control of Nabors more expensive. WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DEBT OUTSTANDING We had approximately $2.0 billion in debt outstanding at December 31, 2004, resulting in a funded debt to capital ratio of 0.41:1 and a net funded debt to capital ratio of 0.17:1. Both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. Lower 48, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil, gas and geothermal markets in the world. At the beginning of 1990, our fleet consisted of 44 land drilling rigs in Canada, Alaska and in various international markets. Today, Nabors worldwide fleet consists of almost 600 land drilling rigs, approximately 700 domestic and 215 international land workover and well servicing rigs, 43 offshore platform rigs, 19 jack up units, three barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. Although Nabors continues to examine opportunities, there can be no assurance that attractive rigs or other acquisition opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in making such acquisitions in the future. 9 From time to time, we may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business, if it is economically advantageous for us to do so. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE Nabors does not presently anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change its competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2005. Nabors believes it is in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations, and the cost of such compliance is not material to the business or financial condition of Nabors. For a more detailed description of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to Nabors operations, see above under Risk Factors Noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect Nabors results of operations. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Many of the international drilling rigs and certain of the Alaska rigs in our fleet are supported by mobile camps which house the drilling crews and a significant inventory of spare parts and supplies. In addition, we own various trucks, forklifts, cranes, earth moving and other construction and transportation equipment, which are used to support the drilling and logistics operations. Nabors and its subsidiaries own or lease executive and administrative office space in St. Michael, Barbados (principal executive office); Houston, Texas; Anchorage, Alaska; Harvey, Houma, Iberia, and New Iberia, Louisiana; Bakersfield, California; Magnolia, Texas; Calgary and Nisku, Alberta, Canada; Sanaa, Yemen; Dubai, U.A.E.; Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; and Anaco, Venezuela. We also own or lease a number of facilities and storage yards used in support of operations in each of our geographic markets. Nabors and its subsidiaries own certain mineral interests in connection with their investing and operating activities. Nabors does not consider these properties to be material to its overall operations. Additional information about our properties can be found in Notes 2 and 5 (each, under the caption "Property, Plant and Equipment") and 13 (under the caption "Operating Leases") of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 below. The revenues and property, plant and equipment by geographic area for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, can be found in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 below. A description of our rig fleet is included under the caption "Introduction" in Part I Item 1 Business. Nabors management believes that our equipment and facilities are adequate to support our current level of operations as well as an expansion of drilling operations in those geographical areas where we may expand. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Nabors and its subsidiaries are defendants or otherwise involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary course of their business. In the opinion of management, our ultimate liability with respect to these pending lawsuits is not expected to have a significant or material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Not applicable. 10 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER REPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES I. MARKET AND SHARE PRICES. Our shares are traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "NBR". At December 31, 2004, there were approximately 2,218 shareholders of record. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common shares since 1982. Nabors does not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on its common shares. However, we note that there have been recent positive industry trends and changes in tax law providing more favorable treatment of dividends. As a result, we can give no assurance that we will not reevaluate our position on dividends in the future. The following table sets forth the reported high and low sales prices of our common shares as reported on the American Stock Exchange. SHARE PRICE CALENDAR YEAR HIGH LOW 2003 First quarter $42.60 $32.20 Second quarter 45.85 37.65 Third quarter 40.50 33.87 Fourth quarter 42.52 35.76 2004 First quarter 49.32 41.01 Second quarter 47.70 40.02 Third quarter 47.87 41.25 Fourth quarter 54.25 45.87 II. DIVIDEND POLICY. See "Part I Item 1 Business Risk Factors We do not currently intend to pay dividends." III. SHAREHOLDER MATTERS. Bermuda has exchange controls which apply to residents in respect of the Bermudian dollar. As an exempt company, Nabors is considered to be nonresident for such controls; consequently, there are no Bermuda governmental restrictions on the Companys ability to make transfers and carry out transactions in all other currencies, including currency of the United States. There is no reciprocal tax treaty between Bermuda and the United States regarding withholding taxes.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NATURE OF OPERATIONS Nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world. We conduct oil, gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Alaska, Canada, South and Central America, the Middle East, the Far East and Africa. Nabors also is one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the United States and Canada and is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. To further supplement and complement our primary business, we offer a wide range of ancillary well site services, including engineering, transportation, construction, maintenance, well logging, directional drilling, rig instrumentation, data collection and other support services, in selected domestic and international markets. We have also made selective investments in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities. The majority of our business is conducted through our various Contract Drilling operating segments, which include our drilling, workover and well servicing operations, on land and offshore. Our limited oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are included in a category labeled Oil and Gas for segment reporting purposes. Our operating segments engaged in marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in a category labeled Other Operating Segments for segment reporting purposes. A discussion of our results of operations for the last three years is included below. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II Item 8 below. 13 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, INCREASE (DECREASE) 2004 2003 2002 2004 TO 2003 2003 TO 2002 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND RIG ACTIVITY) Reportable segments: Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates: Contract Drilling: (1) U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling $ 748,999 $ 476,258 $ 374,659 $272,741 57% $101,599 27% U.S. Land Well servicing 360,010 312,279 294,428 47,731 15% 17,851 6% U.S. Offshore 132,778 101,566 105,717 31,212 31% (4,151) (4%) Alaska 83,835 112,092 118,199 (28,257) (25%) (6,107) (5%) Canada 426,675 322,303 141,497 104,372 32% 180,806 128% International 444,289 396,884 320,160 47,405 12% 76,724 24% Subtotal Contract Drilling (2) 2,196,586 1,721,382 1,354,660 475,204 28% 366,722 27% Oil and Gas (3) 65,303 16,919 7,223 48,384 286% 9,696 134% Other Operating Segments (4) (5) 205,615 201,660 174,775 3,955 2% 26,885 15% Other reconciling items (6) (69,416) (49,775) (55,440) (19,641) (39%) 5,665 10% Total $2,398,088 $1,890,186 $1,481,218 $507,902 27% $408,968 28% Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities: (7) Contract Drilling: U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling $ 93,573 $ 16,800 $ 23,415 $ 76,773 457% $ (6,615) (28%) U.S. Land Well servicing 57,712 47,082 38,631 10,630 23% 8,451 22% U.S. Offshore 20,611 1,649 (1,397) 18,962 N/M (8) 3,046 218% Alaska 16,052 37,847 31,387 (21,795) (58%) 6,460 21% Canada 91,421 59,856 17,413 31,565 53% 42,443 244% International 89,211 77,964 76,121 11,247 14% 1,843 2% Subtotal Contract Drilling 368,580 241,198 185,570 127,382 53% 55,628 30% Oil and Gas 13,736 5,850 (1,058) 7,886 135% 6,908 N/M (8) Other Operating Segments (5,333) 3,266 24,660 (8,599) (263%) (21,394) (87%) Other reconciling items (9) (47,331) (37,611) (39,124) (9,720) (26%) 1,513 4% Total $ 329,652 $ 212,703 $ 170,048 $116,949 55% $ 42,655 25% Interest expense (48,507) (70,740) (67,068) 22,233 31% (3,672) (5%) Investment income 50,064 33,813 36,961 16,251 48% (3,148) (9%) Gains (losses) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other income (expense), net 4,629 (1,153) 833 5,782 N/M (8) (1,986) (238%) Income before income taxes $ 335,838 $ 174,623 $ 140,774 $161,215 92% $ 33,849 24% Rig activity: Rig years: (10) U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling 199.0 143.1 103.0 55.9 39% 40.1 39% U.S. Offshore 14.4 14.1 14.5 .3 2% (.4) (3%) Alaska 6.9 7.9 9.3 (1.0) (13%) (1.4) (15%) Canada 46.5 42.1 22.9 4.4 10% 19.2 84% International (11) 67.7 61.1 55.1 6.6 11% 6.0 11% Total rig years 334.5 268.3 204.8 66.2 25% 63.5 31% Rig hours: (12) U.S. Land Well servicing 1,137,914 1,088,511 1,014,657 49,403 5% 73,854 7% Canada Well servicing (13) 377,170 321,472 164,785 55,698 17% 156,687 95% Total rig hours 1,515,084 1,409,983 1,179,442 105,101 7% 230,541 20% 14 (1) These segments include our drilling, workover and well servicing operations, on land and offshore. (2) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $1.6 million, $2.8 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (3) Represents our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. (4) Includes our marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations. (5) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $2.5 million, $7.4 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (6) Represents the elimination of inter segment transactions. (7) Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company. A reconciliation of this non GAAP measure to income before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading Results of Operations above. (8) The percentage is so large that it is not meaningful. (9) Represents the elimination of inter segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses. (10) Excludes well servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Rig years represents a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365 day period represents 0.5 rig years. (11) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates which totaled 4.0 years, 3.8 years and 3.7 years during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (12) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well servicing rig fleet operated during the year. (13) The Canada Well servicing operation was acquired during April 2002 as part of our acquisition of Enserco Energy Service Company Inc. 15 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for 2004 totaled $2.4 billion, representing an increase of $507.9 million, or 27%, compared to 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for 2004 totaled $329.7 million and $302.5 million ($1.92 per diluted share), respectively, representing increases of 55% and 57%, respectively, compared to 2003. The increase in our operating results during 2004 resulted from higher revenues realized by essentially all of our business units as a result of higher activity levels and higher average dayrates during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase in activity reflects an increase in demand for our services in these markets during 2004, which resulted from continuing higher price levels for natural gas and oil during 2003 and 2004. Natural gas prices are the primary driver of our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian and U.S. Offshore (Gulf of Mexico) operations, while oil prices are the primary driver of our Alaskan, International and U.S. Land Well servicing operations. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price (per Bloomberg) averaged $5.90 per million cubic feet (mcf) during 2004, up from a $5.49 per mcf average during 2003. West Texas intermediate spot oil prices (per Bloomberg) averaged $41.51 per barrel during 2004, up from a $31.06 per barrel average during 2003. Our operating results for 2005 are expected to increase from levels realized during 2004 given our current expectation of the continuation of high commodity prices during 2005 and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates. The expected increase in drilling activity and dayrates should have the largest impact on our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and Canadian operations. Canadian drilling activity is subject to substantial levels of seasonality, as activity levels typically peak in the first quarter, decline substantially in the second quarter, and then generally increase over the last half of the year. We also expect an improvement in operating results for our U.S. Offshore operations during 2005 primarily as a result of higher dayrates and a continuing improvement in the utilization of our workover jack up rigs. We expect results from our International operations during 2005 to increase compared to 2004 as a result of new rigs operating under contract in Saudi Arabia and our expectations of opportunities in various regions of the world, with the largest impact expected from our operations in North Africa, the Middle East and Mexico. Our U.S. Land Well servicing operations are expected to improve given our expectations of commodity prices during 2005 discussed above. We expect results from our operations in Alaska to be reduced overall in 2005 compared to 2004, resulting from the lack of demand for drilling services by major operators in that market. CONTRACT DRILLING Our Contract Drilling operating segments contain one or more of the following operations: drilling, workover and well servicing, on land and offshore. Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for these operating segments totaled $2.2 billion and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $368.6 million during 2004, representing increases of 28% and 53%, respectively, compared to 2003. Rig years (excluding well servicing rigs) increased to 334.5 years during 2004 from 268.3 years during 2003, as a result of increased capital spending by our customers, which resulted from the improvement in commodity prices discussed above. U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling Operating revenues totaled $749.0 million during 2004, representing an increase of 57% compared to 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $93.6 million during 2004 compared to $16.8 million during 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from increased drilling activity, which was driven by higher natural gas prices and is reflected in the increase in rig years to 199.0 years during 2004 from 143.1 years during 2003, and higher average dayrates compared to the prior year. U.S. Land Well servicing Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $360.0 million and $57.7 million, respectively, during 2004, representing increases of 15% and 23%, respectively, compared to 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from an increase in average dayrates compared to the prior year and an increase in well servicing activity, which was driven by higher oil prices and is reflected in the increase in well servicing hours to 1,137,914 hours during 2004 compared to 1,088,511 hours during 2003. U.S. Offshore Operating revenues totaled $132.8 million during 2004, representing an increase of 31% compared to 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $20.6 million during 2004 compared to $1.6 million during 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from the addition of three new platform rigs for deepwater development projects, one of which commenced operations in the first quarter of 2004, and two of which commenced operations late in the second quarter of 2004. Our U.S. Offshore operations were also positively impacted by an increase in average dayrates for our platform and jack up rigs during 2004 compared to 2003. Rig years for our U.S. 16 Offshore operations were relatively flat during 2004 compared to 2003, totaling 14.4 years for 2004 compared to 14.1 years during 2003. Alaskan Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $83.8 million and $16.1 million, respectively, during 2004, representing decreases of 25% and 58%, respectively, compared to 2003. These decreases primarily resulted from lower drilling activity, deferred revenue recognized on one of our rigs in 2003 that did not recur in 2004, and an incremental $5.7 million of Operating revenues recorded in the first quarter of 2003, representing business interruption insurance proceeds related to the damage incurred on one of our land drilling rigs. The decrease in drilling activity during 2004 primarily resulted from the completion of a significant long term contract in late 2003 that has not yet been renewed or replaced and is reflected in the decrease in rig years to 6.9 years during 2004 from 7.9 years during 2003. Canadian Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $426.7 million and $91.4 million, respectively, during 2004, representing increases of 32% and 53%, respectively, compared to 2003. These increases resulted from an increase in drilling and well servicing revenues, resulting from an overall increase in drilling and well servicing activity (which was driven by increased natural gas prices), and an increase in average dayrates compared to the prior year. Rig years in Canada increased to 46.5 years during 2004 from 42.1 years during 2003. Well servicing hours increased to 377,170 hours during 2004 from 321,472 hours during 2003. Our Canadian results were also positively impacted by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during 2004. International Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $444.3 million and $89.2 million, respectively, during 2004, representing increases of 12% and 14%, respectively, compared to 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from an increase in operations in Mexico and Saudi Arabia and from the addition of operations in India and Indonesia, which began in the fourth quarter of 2003, partially offset by a decrease in operations in Trinidad, Yemen, Colombia and Algeria compared to the prior year. International rig years increased to 67.7 years during 2004 from 61.1 years during 2003. OIL AND GAS This operating segment represents our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations, which we conduct in multiple locations, including South Texas, North Louisiana, South Louisiana, Offshore Gulf of Mexico, and Colombia. Oil and Gas Operating revenues increased to $65.3 million during 2004 from $16.9 million during 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities increased to $13.7 million during 2004 from $5.9 million during 2003. Operating results increased during 2004 as a result of new investments in oil and gas properties resulting from the agreements executed with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities for 2004 was partially offset by $2.4 million in expense (included in direct costs in our consolidated statements of income) recognized during the second quarter of 2004 as a result of a dry hole offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, which exceeded $1.4 million in expense recognized during the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of a dry hole also in the Gulf of Mexico. In the fourth quarter of 2003 we entered into four separate agreements with wholly owned subsidiaries of El Paso Corporation resulting in the significant expansion of our oil and gas operations. Under two of these agreements, we are committed to contribute a portion of the cost to develop wells with a combination of proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves located primarily in South Texas, North Louisiana and Offshore Gulf of Mexico, in exchange for a net profits interest in such wells. El Paso serves as operator of all the wells covered in this development program. Under the other two agreements with El Paso, we have committed to share in the cost of drilling exploratory wells in South Texas and South Louisiana in exchange for a share in the prospect leases where the wells are drilled. Based on our current estimation of oil and gas production levels, we expect to receive returns from the wells under the developmental drilling program through the first quarter of 2006 and from the successful wells drilled to date under the exploratory drilling program through 2014. Additionally, in May 2004, we entered into agreements under which we will contribute a portion of the cost to drill exploration and developmental wells in Colombia in exchange for an interest in each of the prospects. The terms of the agreements call for an estimated three year exploratory drilling program and, for any successful prospects, up to an additional 22 24 year developmental drilling program. We also make investments in oil and gas properties with several of our customers. Based on our current estimation of future oil and gas production levels, we expect to receive returns from these investments through 2015. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS These operations include our marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations. Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our Other Operating Segments totaled $205.6 17 million during 2004, representing an increase of 2% compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in revenues for our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, and rig instrumentation and software operations during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase in revenues was primarily driven by the strengthening in the drilling market in the U.S. and Canada during 2004 as discussed for our Contract Drilling segments above. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues for our marine and supply services operations resulting from the consolidation of Sea Mar Management LLC beginning in 2004 (see discussion in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II Item 8) and a decrease in average dayrates during 2004 compared to 2003, which resulted from the loss of some higher rate contracts during the first quarter of 2004 and from an increase in the impact of competition in the markets in which we operate during 2004. Adjusted loss derived from operating activities totaled $5.3 million during 2004 compared to adjusted income derived from operating activities totaling $3.3 million during 2003. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in results for our Alaskan construction and logistics operations compared to 2003, which resulted from certain projects in 2003 that did not recur in 2004 and the loss of a significant contract during the second quarter of 2003, and decreased margins from our marine transportation and supply services, which was driven by lower average dayrates compared to 2003. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION General and administrative expenses totaled $195.4 million during 2004, representing an increase of $30.0 million, or 18%, compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from increased activity in a number of our operating segments including our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, U.S. Land Well servicing and Canadian operations, and from increased expenses at our corporate level. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased (8.2% vs. 8.8%) during 2004 compared to 2003, as these expenses were spread over a larger revenue base. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $254.9 million during 2004, representing an increase of $28.4 million, or 13%, compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in average rig years for our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian land drilling and International operations compared to the prior year, and depreciation on capital expenditures made during 2003 and 2004. Depletion expense totaled $45.5 million during 2004 compared to $8.6 million during 2003. This increase resulted from depletion on oil and gas properties added through our agreements with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. Interest expense totaled $48.5 million during 2004, representing a decrease of $22.2 million, or 31%, compared to 2003. This decrease resulted from the payment upon maturity of our 6.8% senior notes in April 2004 and the redemption of our $825 million zero coupon convertible senior debentures in June 2003. In June 2003 we issued $700 million in zero coupon senior exchangeable notes; the proceeds of which were used to redeem our $825 million senior debentures. The $700 million notes will not accrue interest unless we become obligated to pay contingent interest, while our $825 million senior debentures had an effective interest rate of 2.5%. The amount of contingent interest payable per note in respect to any six month period will equal 0.185% of the principal amount of a note commencing on or after June 15, 2008 only if certain conditions relating to the trading price of the notes are met (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II Item 8 for a more detailed description). Investment income totaled $50.1 million during 2004, representing an increase of $16.3 million, or 48%, compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in gains realized on sales of marketable securities and an increase in gains realized upon redemption of non marketable securities during 2004. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash and marketable securities balances in 2004 compared to 2003 and from lower average yields on our investments driven by an overall declining interest rate environment. Gains (losses) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other income (expense), net increased to $4.6 million during 2004 from ($1.2) million during 2003. These amounts for 2004 include mark to market gains on our range cap and floor derivative instrument of approximately $2.4 million. These amounts for 2003 include the recognition of approximately $1.2 million of expense related to the settlement of amounts due to the counterparty for our range cap and floor derivative instrument (offset by mark to market gains on that derivative instrument of $.1 million) and a loss of approximately $.9 million resulting from the redemption of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes at prices higher than their carrying value on April 1, 2003, partially offset by gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately $2.5 million. Our effective income tax (benefit) rate was 10% during 2004 compared to (10%) for 2003. The change from an income tax benefit in 2003 to an income tax expense in 2004 resulted from a higher proportion of our taxable income being generated in the U.S. for 2004 compared to 2003. Income generated in the U.S. is generally taxed at a higher rate than in international jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate for 2004 was also positively impacted by the release of certain tax reserves, which were determined to no longer be necessary, resulting in a reduction in deferred income tax expense (non cash) totaling approximately $16.0 million ($.10 per diluted share). In October 2004 the U.S. Congress passed and the 18 President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Act did not impact the corporate reorganization completed by Nabors effective June 24, 2002, that made us a foreign entity. It is possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties) could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization, depending on any responsive action taken by Nabors. We expect our effective tax rate during 2005 to be in the 22% 25% range because we expect a high proportion of our income to be generated in the U.S., which is generally taxed at a higher rate than in international jurisdictions in which we operate. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for 2003 totaled $1.9 billion, representing an increase of $409.0 million, or 28%, compared to 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for 2003 totaled $212.7 million and $192.2 million ($1.25 per diluted share), respectively, representing increases of 25% and 58%, respectively, compared to 2002. The increase in our Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during 2003 primarily resulted from higher revenues realized by our Canadian, U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and International operations. The improved revenues from our Canadian operations resulted from an increase in the level of activity for our land drilling and well servicing operations driven by increased demand for our services in that market during 2003 and our acquisition of Enserco Energy Service Company Inc. in April 2002. The Enserco acquisition increased the number of drilling rigs owned and operated by Nabors in Canada by 30 drilling rigs while also adding over 200 well servicing rigs. The improved revenues for our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operations resulted from higher activity levels driven by a gradual increase in demand for drilling services in that market during 2003. The overall increase in demand in these markets was driven by higher average price levels for natural gas in 2003 compared to 2002. International revenues improved primarily as a result of six new long term contracts for our operation in Mexico. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities during 2003 primarily resulted from the increase in revenues discussed above. However, the overall increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities for 2003 was partially offset by lower average dayrates in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operations during 2003 and lower margins realized by certain of our Other Operating Segments. The decrease in average dayrates for our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operations resulted from dayrates declining during 2002 and remaining flat until the latter part of 2003 when dayrates began to rise. This decline in dayrates during 2002 resulted from the weakness in this market over the period beginning in the third quarter of 2001 and extending through the end of 2002. The decrease in margins for our Other Operating Segments is discussed in detail below. As discussed above, natural gas prices are the primary driver of our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian and U.S. Offshore operations, while oil prices are the primary driver of our Alaskan, International and U.S. Land Well servicing operations. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price (per Bloomberg) averaged $5.49 per mcf during 2003, up from a $3.37 per mcf average during 2002. West Texas intermediate spot oil prices (per Bloomberg) averaged $31.06 per barrel during 2003, up from a $26.17 per barrel average during 2002. CONTRACT DRILLING Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our Contract Drilling operating segments totaled $1.7 billion and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $241.2 million in 2003, representing increases of 27% and 30%, respectively, compared to 2002. Rig years (excluding well servicing rigs) increased to 268.3 years during 2003 from 204.8 years during 2002 as a result of increased capital spending by our customers, which resulted from the improvement in commodity prices. U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $476.3 million and $16.8 million, respectively, in 2003, representing an increase of 27% and a decrease of 28%, respectively, compared to 2002. The increase in Operating revenues resulted from the increase in drilling activity driven by higher natural gas prices, which is reflected in the increase in rig years to 143.1 years during 2003 compared to 103.0 years during 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased during 2003, despite the increase in rig activity, as a result of lower average dayrates, rising labor costs and higher depreciation expense. U.S. Land Well servicing Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $312.3 million and $47.1 million, respectively, in 2003, representing increases of 6% and 22%, respectively, compared to 2002. The improved results in 2003 resulted from an increase in well servicing utilization driven by the increase in spending by our customers during 2003 and a marginal increase in average dayrates compared to 2002. The strengthening in this market resulted primarily from the improvement in commodity prices in 2003. U.S. Land Well servicing hours increased to 1,088,511 hours during 2003 from 1,014,657 hours during 2002. 19 U.S. Offshore Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $101.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in 2003, representing a decrease of 4% and an increase of 218%, respectively, compared to 2002. The decrease in Operating revenues in 2003 primarily relates to the inclusion in our 2002 Operating revenues of $6.4 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to our Dolphin 105 jack up rig, which was lost in a hurricane during 2002, and from lower rig years in 2003 compared to 2002. Rig years for our U.S. Offshore operations totaled 14.1 years during 2003 compared to 14.5 years during 2002. The decrease in Operating revenues in 2003 was partially offset by higher average dayrates in 2003 compared to 2002 resulting from an overall tightening of rig supply in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2003. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities during 2003 resulted primarily from increased working days for our 1,000 horsepower workover rigs that currently generate higher daily cash margins than the remainder of our rigs, which was only partially offset by lower rig years in 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities for 2003 was also positively impacted by lower costs due to increased monitoring of costs on working rigs and reductions in fixed overhead and costs for non working rigs. Alaskan Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $112.1 million and $37.8 million, respectively, in 2003, representing a decrease of 5% and an increase of 21%, respectively, compared to 2002. The decrease in Operating revenues resulted from lower drilling activity reflected in the decrease in rig years to 7.9 years during 2003 from 9.3 years during 2002, which was primarily driven by two of our customers decreasing their level of winter exploration activity. This reduced activity level was partially offset by an incremental $5.7 million of Operating revenues, representing business interruption insurance proceeds recorded during 2003 related to the damage incurred on one of our land drilling rigs in 2001, which exceeded the $3.1 million in business interruption insurance proceeds recorded during 2002 related to another rig damaged in 2001. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities resulted from the higher level of business interruption insurance proceeds recognized in 2003 than in 2002 and from projects where we earned a standby with crew rate, which adds to revenues at a level lower than standard rates, but with minimal costs of operation. Canadian Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $322.3 million and $59.9 million, respectively, in 2003, representing increases of 128% and 244%, respectively, compared to 2002. These increases reflect an increase in drilling and well servicing revenues, which resulted from an overall increase in Canadian drilling and well servicing activity driven by increased commodity prices, and from our acquisition of Enserco in April 2002. Rig years in Canada increased to 42.1 years during 2003 from 22.9 years during 2002. Canadian Well servicing hours totaled 321,472 hours during 2003 compared to 164,785 hours during the period from April 26, 2002, the date we acquired Enserco, through December 31, 2002. International Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $396.9 million and $78.0 million, respectively, in 2003, representing increases of 24% and 2%, respectively, compared to 2002. The improved results in 2003 primarily resulted from six new long term contracts for our operation in Mexico. International rig years increased to 61.1 years during the current year from 55.1 years during 2002 primarily as a result of these new contracts. OIL AND GAS Oil and Gas Operating revenues totaled $16.9 million during 2003, representing an increase of 134% compared to 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $5.9 million during 2003 compared to an adjusted loss derived from operating activities totaling $1.1 million during 2002. The increase in operating results during 2004 as a result of new investments in oil and gas properties resulting from the agreements executed with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our Other Operating Segments totaled $201.7 million during 2003 representing an increase of 15% compared to 2002. This increase primarily resulted from the acquisition of Ryan Energy Technologies, Inc. during the fourth quarter of 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities for our Other Operating Segments totaled $3.3 million during 2003 representing a decrease of 87% compared to 2002. While Ryans results have been additive to our revenues, this new business realized a loss during 2003. In addition, decreased margins from our marine transportation services, which resulted from lower average dayrates, and from our top drive manufacturing operations, which resulted from fewer top drive sales in 2003 compared to 2002, resulted in lower profitability for our Other Operating Segments compared to 2002. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION General and administrative expenses increased by $23.5 million, or 17%, in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily as a result of increases related to our Canadian acquisitions in 2002 and increased International activity. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 (8.8% vs. 9.7%) as these expenses were spread over a larger revenue base. 20 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $38.9 million, or 21%, in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of an increase in average rig years for our Canadian land drilling, U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and International operations, a full year of depreciation in 2003 on assets acquired in our Enserco (April 2002) and Ryan (October 2002) acquisitions, as well as other capital expenditures during 2002 and 2003. Depletion expense totaled $8.6 million during 2003 compared to $7.7 million during 2002. This increase resulted from depletion on oil and gas properties added through our agreements with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. Interest expense increased by $3.7 million, or 5%, in 2003 compared to 2002 resulting from the issuance of our $225 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes and our $275 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes in August 2002, which was only partially offset by reduced interest costs realized in 2003 from the issuance of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes in June 2003. Such notes will not accrue interest unless we become obligated to pay contingent interest. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to redeem our $825 million zero coupon convertible senior debentures, which had an effective interest rate of 2.5%. We also redeemed our 8.625% senior subordinated notes due April 2008 on April 1, 2003. Investment income decreased by $3.1 million, or 9%, in 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting lower average yields on investments resulting from the overall declining interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average cash and marketable securities balances. Gains (losses) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other income (expense), net decreased to ($1.2) million during 2003 from $.8 million during 2002. These amounts for 2003 include the recognition of approximately $1.2 million of expense related to the settlement of amounts due to the counterparty for our range cap and floor derivative instrument (offset by mark to market gains on that derivative instrument of $.1 million) and a loss of approximately $.9 million resulting from the redemption of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes at prices higher than their carrying value on April 1, 2003, partially offset by gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately $2.5 million. These amounts for 2002 include gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately $8.3 million, partially offset by impairment charges of approximately $3.7 million related to our reclassification of four supply vessels to held for sale (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 below), mark to market losses recorded on our range cap and floor derivative instrument of approximately $2.0 million and the recognition of approximately $3.8 million in non recurring corporate reorganization expense. Our effective income (benefit) tax rate was (10%) during 2003 compared to 14% during 2002. The tax benefit position for 2003 resulted primarily from tax savings realized as a result of our corporate reorganization effective June 24, 2002. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS Our cash flows primarily depend on the level of spending by our customers, oil and gas companies, for exploration, development and production activities. Sustained increases or decreases in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on these activities, and could also materially affect our cash flows. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures, purchases and sales of marketable securities, issuances and repurchases of debt, and repurchases of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $563.2 million during 2004 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $395.7 million during 2003. During 2004 and 2003 net income was increased for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization, and depletion, and was reduced for changes in our working capital and other balance sheet accounts. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used for investing activities totaled $549.1 million during 2004 compared to net cash used for investing activities totaling $408.2 million during 2003. During 2004 and 2003 cash was used for capital expenditures and purchases, net of sales, of marketable and non marketable securities. 21 FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used for financing activities totaled $221.2 million during 2004 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $171.5 million during 2003. During 2004 cash was used for the reduction of long term debt (including the payment upon maturity of our 6.8% senior notes in April 2004) and was provided by our receipt of proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire our common shares by our employees. During 2003 cash was provided by the issuance of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes during June 2003 and our receipt of proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire our common shares by our employees, and was used for the reduction of long term debt. FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS As of December 31, 2004, we had long term debt, including current maturities, of $2.0 billion and cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non marketable securities of $1.4 billion. Our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures can be put to us on February 5, 2006, February 5, 2011 and February 5, 2016, for a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of repurchase. The amount of the purchase price would total $826.8 million, $936.2 million and $1.1 billion if the debentures were put to us on February 5, 2006, February 5, 2011 or February 5, 2016, respectively. Additionally, each of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes and our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures provide that upon an exchange or conversion, as applicable, of these convertible debt instruments, we will be required to pay holders of these debt instruments, in lieu of common shares, cash up to the principal amount of the instruments and, at our option, consideration in the form of either cash or our common shares for any amount above the principal amount of the instruments required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the indentures. As our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures can be converted at any time resulting in our payment of cash, the outstanding principal amount of these debentures of $804.6 million is included in current liabilities in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. These debentures previously would have been classified in current liabilities beginning in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the holders having the option to put the debentures to us on February 5, 2006. If the $1.381 billion debentures were converted, our cash obligation would be an amount equal to the lesser of 8.5 million multiplied by the sale price of our common shares on the trading day immediately prior to the related conversion date or the principal amount of the debentures on the date of conversion. If these debentures had been converted on December 31, 2004, we would have been required to pay cash totaling approximately $435 million to the holders of the debentures (based on the closing price for our common shares on December 30, 2004 of $51.18). As this amount is substantially lower than the $826.8 million that the holders of the debentures will receive if they put the debentures to us on the first put date of February 5, 2006 or if they sold the debentures in the open market, we do not currently expect the debentures to be converted and any payment to be required prior to February 5, 2006 (when the holders have the option to put the debentures back to us), unless the price for our shares were to exceed approximately $94. Our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes cannot be exchanged until the price for our shares exceeds approximately $84 or in various other circumstances as described in the note indenture (see discussion in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8). As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately $114.2 million, primarily for rig related enhancing and sustaining capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures for 2005 are currently expected to be approximately $550 million, including currently planned rig related enhancing and sustaining capital expenditures. This amount could change significantly based on market conditions and new business opportunities. We have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations. Several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of our common shares. Future acquisitions may be paid for using existing cash or issuance of debt or Nabors shares. Such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors. 22 Historical capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, which represent the portion of the purchase price of acquisitions allocated to fixed assets and goodwill based on their fair market value, are classified as follows: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) Sustaining $229,154 $159,932 $102,633 Enhancement 130,656 110,852 136,837 Acquisition of assets and businesses 65,550 13,578 439,632 New construction 63,766 15,060 14,008 Net profits interests in oil and gas properties 55,303 53,716 9,733 $544,429 $353,138 $702,843 See our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods included under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees) below.

The principal amount of these debentures of $804.6 million are classified in current liabilities as of December 31, 2004. However, we do not expect these debentures to be converted for cash within the next 12 months based on the current market value of our shares (see discussion above). (2) Includes our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes, which can be put to us on June 15, 2008, and $225 million of our senior notes due 2009. (3) See Note 13 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. (4) Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (5) See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During 2002 our Board of Directors authorized the continuation of a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase our common shares in the open market. Under this program we are authorized to purchase up to $400 million of our common shares. Through December 31, 2004, approximately $248 million of our common shares have been repurchased under this program. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, marketable and non marketable securities and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non marketable securities of $1.4 billion (including $510.5 million of long term marketable and non marketable securities) and working capital of $381.7 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non 23 marketable securities of $1.6 billion (including $612.4 million of long term marketable securities) and working capital of $917.3 million as of December 31, 2003. Our funded debt to capital ratio was 0.41:1 as of December 31, 2004 and 0.48:1 as of December 31, 2003. Our net funded debt to capital ratio was 0.17:1 as of December 31, 2004 and 0.22:1 as of December 31, 2003. The funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing funded debt by funded debt plus capital. Funded debt is defined as the sum of (1) short term borrowings, (2) current portion of long term debt and (3) long term debt. Capital is defined as shareholders equity. The net funded debt to capital ratio nets cash and cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities against funded debt. This ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net funded debt plus capital. Both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital. Non marketable securities consist of investments in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private U.S. and non U.S. securities (including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities, global structured asset securitizations, whole loan mortgages, and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages). These investments are classified as non marketable, because they do not have published fair values, and are recorded at cost in our consolidated balance sheets (the current portion is classified as non marketable securities under current assets and the long term portion is included as a component of other long term assets). Our interest coverage ratio was 14.1:1 as of December 31, 2004, compared to 6.8:1 as of December 31, 2003. The interest coverage ratio is computed by calculating the sum of income before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense and then dividing by interest expense. This ratio is a method for calculating the amount of cash flows available to cover interest expense. We have three letter of credit facilities with various banks as of December 31, 2004. Availability and borrowings under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2004 are as follows: (IN THOUSANDS) Credit available $110,000 Letters of credit outstanding (77,876) Remaining availability $ 32,124 We have a shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow us to offer, from time to time, up to $700 million in debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred shares, depository shares, common shares, share purchase contracts, share purchase units and warrants. We currently have not issued any securities registered under this registration statement. Our current cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable and non marketable securities and projected cash flow generated from current operations are expected to more than adequately finance our sustaining capital expenditures, our debt service requirements, and all other expected cash requirements for the next twelve months. See our discussion of the impact of changes in market conditions on our derivative financial instruments discussed under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk below. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS (INCLUDING GUARANTEES) We are a party to certain transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as "off balance sheet arrangements" that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The most significant of these off balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations in which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these agreements serve as guarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program, other financial surety instruments such as bonds, and guarantees of residual value in certain of our operating lease agreements. We have also guaranteed payment of contingent consideration in conjunction with an acquisition in 2002, which is based on future operating results of that business. In addition, we have provided indemnifications to certain third parties which serve as guarantees. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our stock transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees. 24 Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. The following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial and performance guarantees issued by Nabors: MAXIMUM AMOUNT 2005 2006 2007 THEREAFTER TOTAL (IN THOUSANDS) Financial standby letters of credit and other financial surety instruments $81,067 $ $ $302 $81,369 Guarantee of residual value in lease agreements 684 65 749 Contingent consideration in acquisition 2,000 500 2,500 Total $83,751 $565 $ $302 $84,618 OTHER MATTERS RECENT LEGISLATION, COAST GUARD REGULATIONS AND ACTIONS Our Sea Mar division time charters supply vessels to offshore operators in U.S. waters. The vessels are owned by one of our financing company subsidiaries, but are operated and managed by a U.S. citizen controlled company pursuant to long term bareboat charters. As a result of recent legislation, beginning in August 2007 Sea Mar will no longer be able to use this arrangement to qualify vessels for employment in the U.S. coastwise trade. Accordingly, we will be required to restructure the arrangement, redeploy the vessels outside the United States, or sell the vessels by no later than such time. As of December 31, 2004, the net assets of Sea Mar totaled approximately $159.8 million. During 2004 Sea Mar had income before income taxes totaling $2.3 million. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS We currently account for stock based compensation as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and because we grant options at prices equal to the market price of our shares on the date of the grant we do not record compensation expense related to these grants. In December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Share Based Payment," which will eliminate our ability to account for stock based compensation using APB 25 and instead would require us to account for stock option awards using a fair value based method resulting in compensation expense for stock option awards. The statement will be effective for stock options granted, modified, or settled in cash in interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Additionally, for stock options granted or modified after December 15, 1994 that have not vested as of the effective date of the statement, compensation cost will be measured and recorded based on the same estimates of fair value calculated as of the date of grant as currently disclosed within the table required by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation an Amendment to FAS 123," presented in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The statement may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations during the periods of adoption and annual and interim periods thereafter. If this statement had been adopted in its current form as of January 1, 2004, we would have recorded additional compensation expense, net of related tax effects, of approximately $22.5 million during 2004 and our diluted earnings per share for 2004 would have been reduced by $.14 per share. In October 2004 the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) in EITF 04 8, which addresses the issue of when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share computations. Based on the concepts described in EITF 04 8, we will be required to treat our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes as converted for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether any triggering contingency has been met or is likely to be met. The provisions in EITF 04 8 are effective for periods ending after December 15, 2004, including the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of this accounting change, we are required to include additional common shares in the denominator of our diluted earnings per share calculation in all periods where the price for our shares exceeds $70.10. These additional shares represent the value in excess of the principal amount of the notes and would be calculated using the treasury stock method. We do not expect this accounting change to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 25 In January 2003 the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE. In December 2003 the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46, Interpretation No. 46R (FIN 46R), to clarify some of the provisions of FIN 46, and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. Application of FIN 46R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application for all other types of VIEs is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. Our adoption of FIN 46R on March 31, 2004 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Pursuant to his employment agreement entered into in October 1996, we provided an unsecured, non interest bearing loan of approximately $2.9 million to Nabors Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer. This loan is due on September 30, 2006. Pursuant to their employment agreements, Nabors and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer, and certain other key employees entered into split dollar life insurance agreements pursuant to which we pay a portion of the premiums under life insurance policies with respect to these individuals and, in certain instances, members of their families. Under these agreements, we are reimbursed for such premiums upon the occurrence of specified events, including the death of an insured individual. Any recovery of premiums paid by Nabors could potentially be limited to the cash surrender value of these policies under certain circumstances. As such, the values of these policies are recorded at their respective cash surrender values in our consolidated balance sheets. We have made premium payments to date totaling $13.2 million related to these policies. The cash surrender value of these policies of approximately $11.8 million and $11.4 million is included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the payment of premiums by Nabors under the agreements with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and with our Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer may be deemed to be prohibited loans by us to these individuals. We have paid no premiums related to our agreements with these individuals since the adoption of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and have postponed premium payments related to our agreements with these individuals. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various rig leases, rig transportation and related oilfield services agreements with our Alaskan and Saudi Arabian unconsolidated affiliates at market prices. Revenues from business transactions with these affiliated entities totaled $63.2 million, $51.3 million and $46.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Expenses from business transactions with these affiliated entities totaled $3.3 million, $3.3 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, we had accounts receivable from these affiliated entities of $20.7 million and $20.9 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We had accounts payable to these affiliated entities of $1.8 million and $.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and a note payable with one of these affiliated entities of $4.1 million and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which is included in other long term liabilities. Additionally, we own certain marine vessels that are chartered under a bareboat charter arrangement to Sea Mar Management LLC, an entity in which we own a 25% interest. Under the requirements of FIN 46R this entity was consolidated by Nabors beginning in 2004. Revenues from business transactions with Sea Mar totaled $29.5 million and $18.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Expenses from business transactions with Sea Mar totaled $47.9 million and $28.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accounts receivable from and accounts payable to Sea Mar as of December 31, 2003 totaled $3.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized 26 during the reporting period. We analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from such estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidation financial position or results of operations. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The drilling, workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive. Property, plant and equipment represented 56% of our total assets as of December 31, 2004, and depreciation constituted 12% of our total costs and other deductions for the year ended December 31, 2004. Depreciation for our primary operating assets, drilling and workover rigs, is calculated based on the units of production method over an approximate 4,900 day period, with the exception of our jack up rigs which are depreciated over an 8,030 day period, after provision for salvage value. When our drilling and workover rigs are not operating, a depreciation charge is provided using the straight line method over an assumed depreciable life of 20 years, with the exception of our jack up rigs, where a 30 year depreciable life is used. Depreciation on our buildings, well servicing rigs, oilfield hauling and mobile equipment, marine transportation and supply vessels, and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value (buildings 10 to 30 years; well servicing rigs 3 to 15 years; marine transportation and supply vessels 10 to 25 years; oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years). These depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property, plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets. Periodically, we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets. Estimation of these items requires significant management judgment. Accordingly, management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property, plant and equipment are critical. There have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets, changes in technology or other factors that indicate that these lives do not continue to be appropriate. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property, plant and equipment, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation, or the methodology applied. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter managements assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS As discussed above, the drilling, workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive, which is evident in the fact that our property, plant and equipment represented 56% of our total assets as of December 31, 2004. Other long lived assets subject to impairment consist primarily of goodwill, which represented 6% of our total assets as of December 31, 2004. We review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In addition, we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable. Such determination requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review in order to determine the future cash flows associated with the asset or, in the case of goodwill, our reporting units. These long term forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions, technological advances in the industry, and changes in regulations governing the industry. Significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. As the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long lived assets is subject to significant management judgment and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income, management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long lived assets is critical. 27 Assumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows. Given the nature of the evaluation of future cash flows and the application to specific assets and specific times, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions. INCOME TAXES Deferred taxes represent a substantial liability for Nabors. For financial reporting purposes, management determines our current tax liability as well as those taxes incurred as a result of current operations yet deferred until future periods. In accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. Currently payable taxes represent the liability related to our income tax return for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets. The changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse. In addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary, management must estimate the timing of their reversal, and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, management has considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These judgments and estimates are made for each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the calculation of deferred taxes is completed at that level. Further, under U.S. federal tax law, the amount and availability of loss carryforwards (and certain other tax attributes) are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests applicable to Nabors and our subsidiaries. The utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or effectively lost upon certain changes in ownership. Accordingly, although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us, no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards, or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future. These loss carryforwards are also considered in our calculation of taxes for each jurisdiction in which we operate. Additionally, we record reserves for uncertain tax positions which are subject to a significant level of management judgment related to the ultimate resolution of those tax positions. Accordingly, management believes that the estimate related to the provision for income taxes is critical to our results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect managements estimates and assumptions regarding the deferred portion of our income tax provision, including estimates of future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, the classification of timing differences as temporary or permanent, reserves recorded for uncertain tax positions, and any valuation allowance recorded as a reduction to our deferred tax assets. Managements assumptions related to the preparation of our income tax provision have historically proved to be reasonable in light of the ultimate amount tax liability due in all taxing jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our provision for income taxes was $33.4 million, consisting of $20.9 million of current tax expense and $12.5 million of deferred tax expense. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions regarding the tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes. Changes in these assumptions could potentially change the effective tax rate. A 1% change in the effective tax rate from 10% to 11% would increase the current year income tax provision by approximately $3.4 million. INSURANCE RESERVES Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well servicing industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental damage and damage to the property of others. Generally, drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer, and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements, we seek protection through insurance. However, there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible. 28 Based on the risks discussed above, it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. We maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation, employers liability, general liability and automobile liability claims. These accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims. These loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid. As the determination of our liability for insurance claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, and such liabilities could be material in nature, management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to estimate insurance reserves. For purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if the December 31, 2004 reserves for insurance were adjusted (increase or decreased) by 10%, total costs and other deductions would have changed by $9.8 million, or .5%. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED We have completed a number of large acquisitions in recent years as discussed in Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with our accounting for these acquisitions, it was necessary for us to estimate the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the various business combinations, which involved the use of various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment, and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter managements assumptions and could result in lower estimates of values of acquired assets or of future cash flows. This could result in impairment charges being recorded in our consolidated statements of income. As the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical. The determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities are based on the market for the assets and the settlement value of the liabilities. These estimates are made by management based on our experience with similar assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to value assets acquired or liabilities assumed. As we have not recorded any significant impairment charges on property, plant and equipment or goodwill in either of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have proved to be reliable. Given the nature of the evaluation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the application to specific assets and liabilities, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We may be exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business. This risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, interest rates, and marketable and non marketable security prices as discussed below. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK We operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate risk. The most significant exposures arise in connection with our operations in Canada, which usually are substantially unhedged. At various times, we utilize local currency borrowings (foreign currency denominated debt), the payment structure of customer contracts and foreign exchange contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets, liabilities, cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies. A foreign exchange contract is a foreign currency transaction, defined as an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given future date and at a specified rate. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of all our foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2004 would result in a $15.5 million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. CREDIT RISK Our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments and marketable and non marketable securities, accounts receivable, and our interest rate swap and range cap and floor transactions. Cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks or investment firms. Our investments in marketable and non marketable securities are managed within established guidelines which limit the amounts that may be invested with any one issuer and which provide guidance as to issuer credit quality. We believe that the credit risk in such instruments is minimal. In addition, our trade receivables are with a variety of U.S., international and foreign country national oil and gas companies. Management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require material collateral. We maintain reserves for potential credit losses, and such losses have been within managements expectations. INTEREST RATE, AND MARKETABLE AND NON MARKETABLE SECURITY PRICE RISK Our financial instruments that are potentially sensitive to changes in interest rates include our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures, our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes, our 4.875% and 5.375% senior notes, our interest rate swap and range cap and floor transactions, our investments in debt securities (including corporate, asset backed, U.S. Government, Government agencies, foreign government, mortgage backed debt and mortgage CMO debt securities) and our investment in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private U.S. and non U.S. securities (including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities, global structured asset securitizations, whole loan mortgages, and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages), which are classified as non marketable securities. We may utilize derivative financial instruments that are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. The use of derivative financial instruments could expose us to further credit risk and market risk. Credit risk in this context is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty would owe us, which can create credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we would owe the counterparty, and therefore, we would not be exposed to credit risk. We attempt to minimize credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with major financial institutions that have a significant asset base. Market risk related to derivatives is the adverse effect to the value of a financial instrument that results from changes in interest rates. We try to manage market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the type and degree of market risk that we undertake. Our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes include a contingent interest provision, discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources above, which qualifies as an embedded derivative under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 149. This embedded derivative is required to be separated from the notes and valued at its fair value at the inception of the note indenture. Any subsequent change in fair value of this embedded derivative would be recorded in our consolidated statements of income. The fair value of the contingent interest provision at inception of the note indenture was nominal. In addition, there was no significant change in the fair value of this embedded derivative through December 31, 2004, resulting in no impact on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2004. On October 21, 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a third party financial institution to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of $200 million of our fixed rate 5.375% senior notes due 2012, which has 30 been designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 149. Additionally, on October 21, 2002, we purchased a LIBOR range cap and sold a LIBOR floor, in the form of a cashless collar, with the same third party financial institution with the intention of mitigating and managing our exposure to changes in the three month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate. This transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 149, and any change in the cumulative fair value of this transaction will be reflected as a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded interest savings related to our interest rate swap agreement accounted for as a fair value hedge of $6.5 million, $6.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which served to reduce interest expense. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement is recorded as a derivative asset, included in other long term assets, and totaled approximately $4.6 million and $4.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The carrying value of our 5.375% senior notes has been increased by the same amount as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The fair value of our range cap and floor transaction is recorded as a derivative asset, included in other long term assets, and totaled approximately $.3 million as of December 31, 2004, and is recorded as a derivative liability, included in other long term liabilities, and totaled approximately $3.7 million and $3.8 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In June 2004 we unwound $100 million of the $200 million range cap and floor derivative instrument. We recorded gains of approximately $2.4 million and losses of approximately $1.1 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to this derivative instrument; such amounts are included in losses (gains) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income. A hypothetical 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates as of December 31, 2004 would decrease the fair values of our interest rate swap, and range cap and floor, by approximately $5.6 million and $.5 million, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NATURE OF OPERATIONS Nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world. We conduct oil, gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Alaska, Canada, South and Central America, the Middle East, the Far East and Africa. Nabors also is one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the United States and Canada and is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. To further supplement and complement our primary business, we offer a wide range of ancillary well site services, including engineering, transportation, construction, maintenance, well logging, directional drilling, rig instrumentation, data collection and other support services, in selected domestic and international markets. We have also made selective investments in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities. The majority of our business is conducted through our various Contract Drilling operating segments, which include our drilling, workover and well servicing operations, on land and offshore. Our limited oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are included in a category labeled Oil and Gas for segment reporting purposes. Our operating segments engaged in marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in a category labeled Other Operating Segments for segment reporting purposes. A discussion of our results of operations for the last three years is included below. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II Item 8 below. 13 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, INCREASE (DECREASE) 2004 2003 2002 2004 TO 2003 2003 TO 2002 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND RIG ACTIVITY) Reportable segments: Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates: Contract Drilling: (1) U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling $ 748,999 $ 476,258 $ 374,659 $272,741 57% $101,599 27% U.S. Land Well servicing 360,010 312,279 294,428 47,731 15% 17,851 6% U.S. Offshore 132,778 101,566 105,717 31,212 31% (4,151) (4%) Alaska 83,835 112,092 118,199 (28,257) (25%) (6,107) (5%) Canada 426,675 322,303 141,497 104,372 32% 180,806 128% International 444,289 396,884 320,160 47,405 12% 76,724 24% Subtotal Contract Drilling (2) 2,196,586 1,721,382 1,354,660 475,204 28% 366,722 27% Oil and Gas (3) 65,303 16,919 7,223 48,384 286% 9,696 134% Other Operating Segments (4) (5) 205,615 201,660 174,775 3,955 2% 26,885 15% Other reconciling items (6) (69,416) (49,775) (55,440) (19,641) (39%) 5,665 10% Total $2,398,088 $1,890,186 $1,481,218 $507,902 27% $408,968 28% Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities: (7) Contract Drilling: U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling $ 93,573 $ 16,800 $ 23,415 $ 76,773 457% $ (6,615) (28%) U.S. Land Well servicing 57,712 47,082 38,631 10,630 23% 8,451 22% U.S. Offshore 20,611 1,649 (1,397) 18,962 N/M (8) 3,046 218% Alaska 16,052 37,847 31,387 (21,795) (58%) 6,460 21% Canada 91,421 59,856 17,413 31,565 53% 42,443 244% International 89,211 77,964 76,121 11,247 14% 1,843 2% Subtotal Contract Drilling 368,580 241,198 185,570 127,382 53% 55,628 30% Oil and Gas 13,736 5,850 (1,058) 7,886 135% 6,908 N/M (8) Other Operating Segments (5,333) 3,266 24,660 (8,599) (263%) (21,394) (87%) Other reconciling items (9) (47,331) (37,611) (39,124) (9,720) (26%) 1,513 4% Total $ 329,652 $ 212,703 $ 170,048 $116,949 55% $ 42,655 25% Interest expense (48,507) (70,740) (67,068) 22,233 31% (3,672) (5%) Investment income 50,064 33,813 36,961 16,251 48% (3,148) (9%) Gains (losses) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other income (expense), net 4,629 (1,153) 833 5,782 N/M (8) (1,986) (238%) Income before income taxes $ 335,838 $ 174,623 $ 140,774 $161,215 92% $ 33,849 24% Rig activity: Rig years: (10) U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling 199.0 143.1 103.0 55.9 39% 40.1 39% U.S. Offshore 14.4 14.1 14.5 .3 2% (.4) (3%) Alaska 6.9 7.9 9.3 (1.0) (13%) (1.4) (15%) Canada 46.5 42.1 22.9 4.4 10% 19.2 84% International (11) 67.7 61.1 55.1 6.6 11% 6.0 11% Total rig years 334.5 268.3 204.8 66.2 25% 63.5 31% Rig hours: (12) U.S. Land Well servicing 1,137,914 1,088,511 1,014,657 49,403 5% 73,854 7% Canada Well servicing (13) 377,170 321,472 164,785 55,698 17% 156,687 95% Total rig hours 1,515,084 1,409,983 1,179,442 105,101 7% 230,541 20% 14 (1) These segments include our drilling, workover and well servicing operations, on land and offshore. (2) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $1.6 million, $2.8 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (3) Represents our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. (4) Includes our marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations. (5) Includes Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, accounted for by the equity method, of $2.5 million, $7.4 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (6) Represents the elimination of inter segment transactions. (7) Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company. A reconciliation of this non GAAP measure to income before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the table set forth immediately following the heading Results of Operations above. (8) The percentage is so large that it is not meaningful. (9) Represents the elimination of inter segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses. (10) Excludes well servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Rig years represents a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365 day period represents 0.5 rig years. (11) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates which totaled 4.0 years, 3.8 years and 3.7 years during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (12) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well servicing rig fleet operated during the year. (13) The Canada Well servicing operation was acquired during April 2002 as part of our acquisition of Enserco Energy Service Company Inc. 15 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for 2004 totaled $2.4 billion, representing an increase of $507.9 million, or 27%, compared to 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for 2004 totaled $329.7 million and $302.5 million ($1.92 per diluted share), respectively, representing increases of 55% and 57%, respectively, compared to 2003. The increase in our operating results during 2004 resulted from higher revenues realized by essentially all of our business units as a result of higher activity levels and higher average dayrates during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase in activity reflects an increase in demand for our services in these markets during 2004, which resulted from continuing higher price levels for natural gas and oil during 2003 and 2004. Natural gas prices are the primary driver of our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian and U.S. Offshore (Gulf of Mexico) operations, while oil prices are the primary driver of our Alaskan, International and U.S. Land Well servicing operations. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price (per Bloomberg) averaged $5.90 per million cubic feet (mcf) during 2004, up from a $5.49 per mcf average during 2003. West Texas intermediate spot oil prices (per Bloomberg) averaged $41.51 per barrel during 2004, up from a $31.06 per barrel average during 2003. Our operating results for 2005 are expected to increase from levels realized during 2004 given our current expectation of the continuation of high commodity prices during 2005 and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates. The expected increase in drilling activity and dayrates should have the largest impact on our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and Canadian operations. Canadian drilling activity is subject to substantial levels of seasonality, as activity levels typically peak in the first quarter, decline substantially in the second quarter, and then generally increase over the last half of the year. We also expect an improvement in operating results for our U.S. Offshore operations during 2005 primarily as a result of higher dayrates and a continuing improvement in the utilization of our workover jack up rigs. We expect results from our International operations during 2005 to increase compared to 2004 as a result of new rigs operating under contract in Saudi Arabia and our expectations of opportunities in various regions of the world, with the largest impact expected from our operations in North Africa, the Middle East and Mexico. Our U.S. Land Well servicing operations are expected to improve given our expectations of commodity prices during 2005 discussed above. We expect results from our operations in Alaska to be reduced overall in 2005 compared to 2004, resulting from the lack of demand for drilling services by major operators in that market. CONTRACT DRILLING Our Contract Drilling operating segments contain one or more of the following operations: drilling, workover and well servicing, on land and offshore. Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for these operating segments totaled $2.2 billion and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $368.6 million during 2004, representing increases of 28% and 53%, respectively, compared to 2003. Rig years (excluding well servicing rigs) increased to 334.5 years during 2004 from 268.3 years during 2003, as a result of increased capital spending by our customers, which resulted from the improvement in commodity prices discussed above. U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling Operating revenues totaled $749.0 million during 2004, representing an increase of 57% compared to 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $93.6 million during 2004 compared to $16.8 million during 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from increased drilling activity, which was driven by higher natural gas prices and is reflected in the increase in rig years to 199.0 years during 2004 from 143.1 years during 2003, and higher average dayrates compared to the prior year. U.S. Land Well servicing Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $360.0 million and $57.7 million, respectively, during 2004, representing increases of 15% and 23%, respectively, compared to 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from an increase in average dayrates compared to the prior year and an increase in well servicing activity, which was driven by higher oil prices and is reflected in the increase in well servicing hours to 1,137,914 hours during 2004 compared to 1,088,511 hours during 2003. U.S. Offshore Operating revenues totaled $132.8 million during 2004, representing an increase of 31% compared to 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $20.6 million during 2004 compared to $1.6 million during 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from the addition of three new platform rigs for deepwater development projects, one of which commenced operations in the first quarter of 2004, and two of which commenced operations late in the second quarter of 2004. Our U.S. Offshore operations were also positively impacted by an increase in average dayrates for our platform and jack up rigs during 2004 compared to 2003. Rig years for our U.S. 16 Offshore operations were relatively flat during 2004 compared to 2003, totaling 14.4 years for 2004 compared to 14.1 years during 2003. Alaskan Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $83.8 million and $16.1 million, respectively, during 2004, representing decreases of 25% and 58%, respectively, compared to 2003. These decreases primarily resulted from lower drilling activity, deferred revenue recognized on one of our rigs in 2003 that did not recur in 2004, and an incremental $5.7 million of Operating revenues recorded in the first quarter of 2003, representing business interruption insurance proceeds related to the damage incurred on one of our land drilling rigs. The decrease in drilling activity during 2004 primarily resulted from the completion of a significant long term contract in late 2003 that has not yet been renewed or replaced and is reflected in the decrease in rig years to 6.9 years during 2004 from 7.9 years during 2003. Canadian Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $426.7 million and $91.4 million, respectively, during 2004, representing increases of 32% and 53%, respectively, compared to 2003. These increases resulted from an increase in drilling and well servicing revenues, resulting from an overall increase in drilling and well servicing activity (which was driven by increased natural gas prices), and an increase in average dayrates compared to the prior year. Rig years in Canada increased to 46.5 years during 2004 from 42.1 years during 2003. Well servicing hours increased to 377,170 hours during 2004 from 321,472 hours during 2003. Our Canadian results were also positively impacted by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during 2004. International Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $444.3 million and $89.2 million, respectively, during 2004, representing increases of 12% and 14%, respectively, compared to 2003. The increase in operating results during 2004 primarily resulted from an increase in operations in Mexico and Saudi Arabia and from the addition of operations in India and Indonesia, which began in the fourth quarter of 2003, partially offset by a decrease in operations in Trinidad, Yemen, Colombia and Algeria compared to the prior year. International rig years increased to 67.7 years during 2004 from 61.1 years during 2003. OIL AND GAS This operating segment represents our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations, which we conduct in multiple locations, including South Texas, North Louisiana, South Louisiana, Offshore Gulf of Mexico, and Colombia. Oil and Gas Operating revenues increased to $65.3 million during 2004 from $16.9 million during 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities increased to $13.7 million during 2004 from $5.9 million during 2003. Operating results increased during 2004 as a result of new investments in oil and gas properties resulting from the agreements executed with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities for 2004 was partially offset by $2.4 million in expense (included in direct costs in our consolidated statements of income) recognized during the second quarter of 2004 as a result of a dry hole offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, which exceeded $1.4 million in expense recognized during the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of a dry hole also in the Gulf of Mexico. In the fourth quarter of 2003 we entered into four separate agreements with wholly owned subsidiaries of El Paso Corporation resulting in the significant expansion of our oil and gas operations. Under two of these agreements, we are committed to contribute a portion of the cost to develop wells with a combination of proved undeveloped, probable and possible reserves located primarily in South Texas, North Louisiana and Offshore Gulf of Mexico, in exchange for a net profits interest in such wells. El Paso serves as operator of all the wells covered in this development program. Under the other two agreements with El Paso, we have committed to share in the cost of drilling exploratory wells in South Texas and South Louisiana in exchange for a share in the prospect leases where the wells are drilled. Based on our current estimation of oil and gas production levels, we expect to receive returns from the wells under the developmental drilling program through the first quarter of 2006 and from the successful wells drilled to date under the exploratory drilling program through 2014. Additionally, in May 2004, we entered into agreements under which we will contribute a portion of the cost to drill exploration and developmental wells in Colombia in exchange for an interest in each of the prospects. The terms of the agreements call for an estimated three year exploratory drilling program and, for any successful prospects, up to an additional 22 24 year developmental drilling program. We also make investments in oil and gas properties with several of our customers. Based on our current estimation of future oil and gas production levels, we expect to receive returns from these investments through 2015. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS These operations include our marine transportation and supply services, drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations. Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our Other Operating Segments totaled $205.6 17 million during 2004, representing an increase of 2% compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in revenues for our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, and rig instrumentation and software operations during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase in revenues was primarily driven by the strengthening in the drilling market in the U.S. and Canada during 2004 as discussed for our Contract Drilling segments above. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues for our marine and supply services operations resulting from the consolidation of Sea Mar Management LLC beginning in 2004 (see discussion in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II Item 8) and a decrease in average dayrates during 2004 compared to 2003, which resulted from the loss of some higher rate contracts during the first quarter of 2004 and from an increase in the impact of competition in the markets in which we operate during 2004. Adjusted loss derived from operating activities totaled $5.3 million during 2004 compared to adjusted income derived from operating activities totaling $3.3 million during 2003. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in results for our Alaskan construction and logistics operations compared to 2003, which resulted from certain projects in 2003 that did not recur in 2004 and the loss of a significant contract during the second quarter of 2003, and decreased margins from our marine transportation and supply services, which was driven by lower average dayrates compared to 2003. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION General and administrative expenses totaled $195.4 million during 2004, representing an increase of $30.0 million, or 18%, compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from increased activity in a number of our operating segments including our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, U.S. Land Well servicing and Canadian operations, and from increased expenses at our corporate level. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased (8.2% vs. 8.8%) during 2004 compared to 2003, as these expenses were spread over a larger revenue base. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $254.9 million during 2004, representing an increase of $28.4 million, or 13%, compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in average rig years for our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian land drilling and International operations compared to the prior year, and depreciation on capital expenditures made during 2003 and 2004. Depletion expense totaled $45.5 million during 2004 compared to $8.6 million during 2003. This increase resulted from depletion on oil and gas properties added through our agreements with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. Interest expense totaled $48.5 million during 2004, representing a decrease of $22.2 million, or 31%, compared to 2003. This decrease resulted from the payment upon maturity of our 6.8% senior notes in April 2004 and the redemption of our $825 million zero coupon convertible senior debentures in June 2003. In June 2003 we issued $700 million in zero coupon senior exchangeable notes; the proceeds of which were used to redeem our $825 million senior debentures. The $700 million notes will not accrue interest unless we become obligated to pay contingent interest, while our $825 million senior debentures had an effective interest rate of 2.5%. The amount of contingent interest payable per note in respect to any six month period will equal 0.185% of the principal amount of a note commencing on or after June 15, 2008 only if certain conditions relating to the trading price of the notes are met (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II Item 8 for a more detailed description). Investment income totaled $50.1 million during 2004, representing an increase of $16.3 million, or 48%, compared to 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in gains realized on sales of marketable securities and an increase in gains realized upon redemption of non marketable securities during 2004. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash and marketable securities balances in 2004 compared to 2003 and from lower average yields on our investments driven by an overall declining interest rate environment. Gains (losses) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other income (expense), net increased to $4.6 million during 2004 from ($1.2) million during 2003. These amounts for 2004 include mark to market gains on our range cap and floor derivative instrument of approximately $2.4 million. These amounts for 2003 include the recognition of approximately $1.2 million of expense related to the settlement of amounts due to the counterparty for our range cap and floor derivative instrument (offset by mark to market gains on that derivative instrument of $.1 million) and a loss of approximately $.9 million resulting from the redemption of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes at prices higher than their carrying value on April 1, 2003, partially offset by gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately $2.5 million. Our effective income tax (benefit) rate was 10% during 2004 compared to (10%) for 2003. The change from an income tax benefit in 2003 to an income tax expense in 2004 resulted from a higher proportion of our taxable income being generated in the U.S. for 2004 compared to 2003. Income generated in the U.S. is generally taxed at a higher rate than in international jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate for 2004 was also positively impacted by the release of certain tax reserves, which were determined to no longer be necessary, resulting in a reduction in deferred income tax expense (non cash) totaling approximately $16.0 million ($.10 per diluted share). In October 2004 the U.S. Congress passed and the 18 President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Act did not impact the corporate reorganization completed by Nabors effective June 24, 2002, that made us a foreign entity. It is possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties) could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization, depending on any responsive action taken by Nabors. We expect our effective tax rate during 2005 to be in the 22% 25% range because we expect a high proportion of our income to be generated in the U.S., which is generally taxed at a higher rate than in international jurisdictions in which we operate. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for 2003 totaled $1.9 billion, representing an increase of $409.0 million, or 28%, compared to 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for 2003 totaled $212.7 million and $192.2 million ($1.25 per diluted share), respectively, representing increases of 25% and 58%, respectively, compared to 2002. The increase in our Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during 2003 primarily resulted from higher revenues realized by our Canadian, U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and International operations. The improved revenues from our Canadian operations resulted from an increase in the level of activity for our land drilling and well servicing operations driven by increased demand for our services in that market during 2003 and our acquisition of Enserco Energy Service Company Inc. in April 2002. The Enserco acquisition increased the number of drilling rigs owned and operated by Nabors in Canada by 30 drilling rigs while also adding over 200 well servicing rigs. The improved revenues for our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operations resulted from higher activity levels driven by a gradual increase in demand for drilling services in that market during 2003. The overall increase in demand in these markets was driven by higher average price levels for natural gas in 2003 compared to 2002. International revenues improved primarily as a result of six new long term contracts for our operation in Mexico. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities during 2003 primarily resulted from the increase in revenues discussed above. However, the overall increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities for 2003 was partially offset by lower average dayrates in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operations during 2003 and lower margins realized by certain of our Other Operating Segments. The decrease in average dayrates for our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operations resulted from dayrates declining during 2002 and remaining flat until the latter part of 2003 when dayrates began to rise. This decline in dayrates during 2002 resulted from the weakness in this market over the period beginning in the third quarter of 2001 and extending through the end of 2002. The decrease in margins for our Other Operating Segments is discussed in detail below. As discussed above, natural gas prices are the primary driver of our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian and U.S. Offshore operations, while oil prices are the primary driver of our Alaskan, International and U.S. Land Well servicing operations. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price (per Bloomberg) averaged $5.49 per mcf during 2003, up from a $3.37 per mcf average during 2002. West Texas intermediate spot oil prices (per Bloomberg) averaged $31.06 per barrel during 2003, up from a $26.17 per barrel average during 2002. CONTRACT DRILLING Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our Contract Drilling operating segments totaled $1.7 billion and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $241.2 million in 2003, representing increases of 27% and 30%, respectively, compared to 2002. Rig years (excluding well servicing rigs) increased to 268.3 years during 2003 from 204.8 years during 2002 as a result of increased capital spending by our customers, which resulted from the improvement in commodity prices. U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $476.3 million and $16.8 million, respectively, in 2003, representing an increase of 27% and a decrease of 28%, respectively, compared to 2002. The increase in Operating revenues resulted from the increase in drilling activity driven by higher natural gas prices, which is reflected in the increase in rig years to 143.1 years during 2003 compared to 103.0 years during 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased during 2003, despite the increase in rig activity, as a result of lower average dayrates, rising labor costs and higher depreciation expense. U.S. Land Well servicing Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $312.3 million and $47.1 million, respectively, in 2003, representing increases of 6% and 22%, respectively, compared to 2002. The improved results in 2003 resulted from an increase in well servicing utilization driven by the increase in spending by our customers during 2003 and a marginal increase in average dayrates compared to 2002. The strengthening in this market resulted primarily from the improvement in commodity prices in 2003. U.S. Land Well servicing hours increased to 1,088,511 hours during 2003 from 1,014,657 hours during 2002. 19 U.S. Offshore Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $101.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in 2003, representing a decrease of 4% and an increase of 218%, respectively, compared to 2002. The decrease in Operating revenues in 2003 primarily relates to the inclusion in our 2002 Operating revenues of $6.4 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to our Dolphin 105 jack up rig, which was lost in a hurricane during 2002, and from lower rig years in 2003 compared to 2002. Rig years for our U.S. Offshore operations totaled 14.1 years during 2003 compared to 14.5 years during 2002. The decrease in Operating revenues in 2003 was partially offset by higher average dayrates in 2003 compared to 2002 resulting from an overall tightening of rig supply in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2003. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities during 2003 resulted primarily from increased working days for our 1,000 horsepower workover rigs that currently generate higher daily cash margins than the remainder of our rigs, which was only partially offset by lower rig years in 2003. Adjusted income derived from operating activities for 2003 was also positively impacted by lower costs due to increased monitoring of costs on working rigs and reductions in fixed overhead and costs for non working rigs. Alaskan Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $112.1 million and $37.8 million, respectively, in 2003, representing a decrease of 5% and an increase of 21%, respectively, compared to 2002. The decrease in Operating revenues resulted from lower drilling activity reflected in the decrease in rig years to 7.9 years during 2003 from 9.3 years during 2002, which was primarily driven by two of our customers decreasing their level of winter exploration activity. This reduced activity level was partially offset by an incremental $5.7 million of Operating revenues, representing business interruption insurance proceeds recorded during 2003 related to the damage incurred on one of our land drilling rigs in 2001, which exceeded the $3.1 million in business interruption insurance proceeds recorded during 2002 related to another rig damaged in 2001. The increase in adjusted income derived from operating activities resulted from the higher level of business interruption insurance proceeds recognized in 2003 than in 2002 and from projects where we earned a standby with crew rate, which adds to revenues at a level lower than standard rates, but with minimal costs of operation. Canadian Operating revenues and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $322.3 million and $59.9 million, respectively, in 2003, representing increases of 128% and 244%, respectively, compared to 2002. These increases reflect an increase in drilling and well servicing revenues, which resulted from an overall increase in Canadian drilling and well servicing activity driven by increased commodity prices, and from our acquisition of Enserco in April 2002. Rig years in Canada increased to 42.1 years during 2003 from 22.9 years during 2002. Canadian Well servicing hours totaled 321,472 hours during 2003 compared to 164,785 hours during the period from April 26, 2002, the date we acquired Enserco, through December 31, 2002. International Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, and adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $396.9 million and $78.0 million, respectively, in 2003, representing increases of 24% and 2%, respectively, compared to 2002. The improved results in 2003 primarily resulted from six new long term contracts for our operation in Mexico. International rig years increased to 61.1 years during the current year from 55.1 years during 2002 primarily as a result of these new contracts. OIL AND GAS Oil and Gas Operating revenues totaled $16.9 million during 2003, representing an increase of 134% compared to 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities totaled $5.9 million during 2003 compared to an adjusted loss derived from operating activities totaling $1.1 million during 2002. The increase in operating results during 2004 as a result of new investments in oil and gas properties resulting from the agreements executed with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our Other Operating Segments totaled $201.7 million during 2003 representing an increase of 15% compared to 2002. This increase primarily resulted from the acquisition of Ryan Energy Technologies, Inc. during the fourth quarter of 2002. Adjusted income derived from operating activities for our Other Operating Segments totaled $3.3 million during 2003 representing a decrease of 87% compared to 2002. While Ryans results have been additive to our revenues, this new business realized a loss during 2003. In addition, decreased margins from our marine transportation services, which resulted from lower average dayrates, and from our top drive manufacturing operations, which resulted from fewer top drive sales in 2003 compared to 2002, resulted in lower profitability for our Other Operating Segments compared to 2002. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION General and administrative expenses increased by $23.5 million, or 17%, in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily as a result of increases related to our Canadian acquisitions in 2002 and increased International activity. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 (8.8% vs. 9.7%) as these expenses were spread over a larger revenue base. 20 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $38.9 million, or 21%, in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of an increase in average rig years for our Canadian land drilling, U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and International operations, a full year of depreciation in 2003 on assets acquired in our Enserco (April 2002) and Ryan (October 2002) acquisitions, as well as other capital expenditures during 2002 and 2003. Depletion expense totaled $8.6 million during 2003 compared to $7.7 million during 2002. This increase resulted from depletion on oil and gas properties added through our agreements with El Paso Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2003. Interest expense increased by $3.7 million, or 5%, in 2003 compared to 2002 resulting from the issuance of our $225 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes and our $275 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes in August 2002, which was only partially offset by reduced interest costs realized in 2003 from the issuance of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes in June 2003. Such notes will not accrue interest unless we become obligated to pay contingent interest. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to redeem our $825 million zero coupon convertible senior debentures, which had an effective interest rate of 2.5%. We also redeemed our 8.625% senior subordinated notes due April 2008 on April 1, 2003. Investment income decreased by $3.1 million, or 9%, in 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting lower average yields on investments resulting from the overall declining interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average cash and marketable securities balances. Gains (losses) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other income (expense), net decreased to ($1.2) million during 2003 from $.8 million during 2002. These amounts for 2003 include the recognition of approximately $1.2 million of expense related to the settlement of amounts due to the counterparty for our range cap and floor derivative instrument (offset by mark to market gains on that derivative instrument of $.1 million) and a loss of approximately $.9 million resulting from the redemption of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes at prices higher than their carrying value on April 1, 2003, partially offset by gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately $2.5 million. These amounts for 2002 include gains on sales of long lived assets of approximately $8.3 million, partially offset by impairment charges of approximately $3.7 million related to our reclassification of four supply vessels to held for sale (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 below), mark to market losses recorded on our range cap and floor derivative instrument of approximately $2.0 million and the recognition of approximately $3.8 million in non recurring corporate reorganization expense. Our effective income (benefit) tax rate was (10%) during 2003 compared to 14% during 2002. The tax benefit position for 2003 resulted primarily from tax savings realized as a result of our corporate reorganization effective June 24, 2002. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS Our cash flows primarily depend on the level of spending by our customers, oil and gas companies, for exploration, development and production activities. Sustained increases or decreases in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on these activities, and could also materially affect our cash flows. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures, purchases and sales of marketable securities, issuances and repurchases of debt, and repurchases of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $563.2 million during 2004 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $395.7 million during 2003. During 2004 and 2003 net income was increased for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization, and depletion, and was reduced for changes in our working capital and other balance sheet accounts. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used for investing activities totaled $549.1 million during 2004 compared to net cash used for investing activities totaling $408.2 million during 2003. During 2004 and 2003 cash was used for capital expenditures and purchases, net of sales, of marketable and non marketable securities. 21 FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used for financing activities totaled $221.2 million during 2004 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $171.5 million during 2003. During 2004 cash was used for the reduction of long term debt (including the payment upon maturity of our 6.8% senior notes in April 2004) and was provided by our receipt of proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire our common shares by our employees. During 2003 cash was provided by the issuance of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes during June 2003 and our receipt of proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire our common shares by our employees, and was used for the reduction of long term debt. FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS As of December 31, 2004, we had long term debt, including current maturities, of $2.0 billion and cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non marketable securities of $1.4 billion. Our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures can be put to us on February 5, 2006, February 5, 2011 and February 5, 2016, for a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of repurchase. The amount of the purchase price would total $826.8 million, $936.2 million and $1.1 billion if the debentures were put to us on February 5, 2006, February 5, 2011 or February 5, 2016, respectively. Additionally, each of our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes and our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures provide that upon an exchange or conversion, as applicable, of these convertible debt instruments, we will be required to pay holders of these debt instruments, in lieu of common shares, cash up to the principal amount of the instruments and, at our option, consideration in the form of either cash or our common shares for any amount above the principal amount of the instruments required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the indentures. As our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures can be converted at any time resulting in our payment of cash, the outstanding principal amount of these debentures of $804.6 million is included in current liabilities in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. These debentures previously would have been classified in current liabilities beginning in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the holders having the option to put the debentures to us on February 5, 2006. If the $1.381 billion debentures were converted, our cash obligation would be an amount equal to the lesser of 8.5 million multiplied by the sale price of our common shares on the trading day immediately prior to the related conversion date or the principal amount of the debentures on the date of conversion. If these debentures had been converted on December 31, 2004, we would have been required to pay cash totaling approximately $435 million to the holders of the debentures (based on the closing price for our common shares on December 30, 2004 of $51.18). As this amount is substantially lower than the $826.8 million that the holders of the debentures will receive if they put the debentures to us on the first put date of February 5, 2006 or if they sold the debentures in the open market, we do not currently expect the debentures to be converted and any payment to be required prior to February 5, 2006 (when the holders have the option to put the debentures back to us), unless the price for our shares were to exceed approximately $94. Our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes cannot be exchanged until the price for our shares exceeds approximately $84 or in various other circumstances as described in the note indenture (see discussion in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8). As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately $114.2 million, primarily for rig related enhancing and sustaining capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures for 2005 are currently expected to be approximately $550 million, including currently planned rig related enhancing and sustaining capital expenditures. This amount could change significantly based on market conditions and new business opportunities. We have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations. Several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of our common shares. Future acquisitions may be paid for using existing cash or issuance of debt or Nabors shares. Such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors. 22 Historical capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, which represent the portion of the purchase price of acquisitions allocated to fixed assets and goodwill based on their fair market value, are classified as follows: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 2002 (IN THOUSANDS) Sustaining $229,154 $159,932 $102,633 Enhancement 130,656 110,852 136,837 Acquisition of assets and businesses 65,550 13,578 439,632 New construction 63,766 15,060 14,008 Net profits interests in oil and gas properties 55,303 53,716 9,733 $544,429 $353,138 $702,843 See our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods included under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees) below. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2004: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD TOTAL < 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 3 5 YEARS THEREAFTER (IN THOUSANDS) Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt: Principal $2,026,800 $ $826,800(1) $925,000(2) $275,000 Interest 163,439 25,750 51,501 47,387 38,801 Operating leases (3) 29,025 11,462 13,677 2,575 1,311 Purchase commitments (4) 114,156 114,156 Employment contracts (3) 8,559 2,440 4,450 1,669 Pension funding obligations (5) 1,027 1,027 Total contractual cash obligations $2,343,006 $154,835 $896,428 $976,631 $315,112 (1) Represents our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures which can be put to us on February 5, 2006. The principal amount of these debentures of $804.6 million are classified in current liabilities as of December 31, 2004. However, we do not expect these debentures to be converted for cash within the next 12 months based on the current market value of our shares (see discussion above). (2) Includes our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes, which can be put to us on June 15, 2008, and $225 million of our senior notes due 2009. (3) See Note 13 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. (4) Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (5) See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During 2002 our Board of Directors authorized the continuation of a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase our common shares in the open market. Under this program we are authorized to purchase up to $400 million of our common shares. Through December 31, 2004, approximately $248 million of our common shares have been repurchased under this program. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, marketable and non marketable securities and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non marketable securities of $1.4 billion (including $510.5 million of long term marketable and non marketable securities) and working capital of $381.7 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable and non 23 marketable securities of $1.6 billion (including $612.4 million of long term marketable securities) and working capital of $917.3 million as of December 31, 2003. Our funded debt to capital ratio was 0.41:1 as of December 31, 2004 and 0.48:1 as of December 31, 2003. Our net funded debt to capital ratio was 0.17:1 as of December 31, 2004 and 0.22:1 as of December 31, 2003. The funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing funded debt by funded debt plus capital. Funded debt is defined as the sum of (1) short term borrowings, (2) current portion of long term debt and (3) long term debt. Capital is defined as shareholders equity. The net funded debt to capital ratio nets cash and cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities against funded debt. This ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net funded debt plus capital. Both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital. Non marketable securities consist of investments in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private U.S. and non U.S. securities (including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities, global structured asset securitizations, whole loan mortgages, and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages). These investments are classified as non marketable, because they do not have published fair values, and are recorded at cost in our consolidated balance sheets (the current portion is classified as non marketable securities under current assets and the long term portion is included as a component of other long term assets). Our interest coverage ratio was 14.1:1 as of December 31, 2004, compared to 6.8:1 as of December 31, 2003. The interest coverage ratio is computed by calculating the sum of income before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense and then dividing by interest expense. This ratio is a method for calculating the amount of cash flows available to cover interest expense. We have three letter of credit facilities with various banks as of December 31, 2004. Availability and borrowings under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2004 are as follows: (IN THOUSANDS) Credit available $110,000 Letters of credit outstanding (77,876) Remaining availability $ 32,124 We have a shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow us to offer, from time to time, up to $700 million in debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred shares, depository shares, common shares, share purchase contracts, share purchase units and warrants. We currently have not issued any securities registered under this registration statement. Our current cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable and non marketable securities and projected cash flow generated from current operations are expected to more than adequately finance our sustaining capital expenditures, our debt service requirements, and all other expected cash requirements for the next twelve months. See our discussion of the impact of changes in market conditions on our derivative financial instruments discussed under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk below. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS (INCLUDING GUARANTEES) We are a party to certain transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as "off balance sheet arrangements" that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The most significant of these off balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations in which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these agreements serve as guarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program, other financial surety instruments such as bonds, and guarantees of residual value in certain of our operating lease agreements. We have also guaranteed payment of contingent consideration in conjunction with an acquisition in 2002, which is based on future operating results of that business. In addition, we have provided indemnifications to certain third parties which serve as guarantees. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our stock transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees. 24 Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. The following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial and performance guarantees issued by Nabors: MAXIMUM AMOUNT 2005 2006 2007 THEREAFTER TOTAL (IN THOUSANDS) Financial standby letters of credit and other financial surety instruments $81,067 $ $ $302 $81,369 Guarantee of residual value in lease agreements 684 65 749 Contingent consideration in acquisition 2,000 500 2,500 Total $83,751 $565 $ $302 $84,618 OTHER MATTERS RECENT LEGISLATION, COAST GUARD REGULATIONS AND ACTIONS Our Sea Mar division time charters supply vessels to offshore operators in U.S. waters. The vessels are owned by one of our financing company subsidiaries, but are operated and managed by a U.S. citizen controlled company pursuant to long term bareboat charters. As a result of recent legislation, beginning in August 2007 Sea Mar will no longer be able to use this arrangement to qualify vessels for employment in the U.S. coastwise trade. Accordingly, we will be required to restructure the arrangement, redeploy the vessels outside the United States, or sell the vessels by no later than such time. As of December 31, 2004, the net assets of Sea Mar totaled approximately $159.8 million. During 2004 Sea Mar had income before income taxes totaling $2.3 million. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS We currently account for stock based compensation as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and because we grant options at prices equal to the market price of our shares on the date of the grant we do not record compensation expense related to these grants. In December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Share Based Payment," which will eliminate our ability to account for stock based compensation using APB 25 and instead would require us to account for stock option awards using a fair value based method resulting in compensation expense for stock option awards. The statement will be effective for stock options granted, modified, or settled in cash in interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Additionally, for stock options granted or modified after December 15, 1994 that have not vested as of the effective date of the statement, compensation cost will be measured and recorded based on the same estimates of fair value calculated as of the date of grant as currently disclosed within the table required by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation an Amendment to FAS 123," presented in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The statement may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations during the periods of adoption and annual and interim periods thereafter. If this statement had been adopted in its current form as of January 1, 2004, we would have recorded additional compensation expense, net of related tax effects, of approximately $22.5 million during 2004 and our diluted earnings per share for 2004 would have been reduced by $.14 per share. In October 2004 the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) in EITF 04 8, which addresses the issue of when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share computations. Based on the concepts described in EITF 04 8, we will be required to treat our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes as converted for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether any triggering contingency has been met or is likely to be met. The provisions in EITF 04 8 are effective for periods ending after December 15, 2004, including the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of this accounting change, we are required to include additional common shares in the denominator of our diluted earnings per share calculation in all periods where the price for our shares exceeds $70.10. These additional shares represent the value in excess of the principal amount of the notes and would be calculated using the treasury stock method. We do not expect this accounting change to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 25 In January 2003 the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE. In December 2003 the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46, Interpretation No. 46R (FIN 46R), to clarify some of the provisions of FIN 46, and to exempt certain entities from its requirements. Application of FIN 46R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application for all other types of VIEs is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. Our adoption of FIN 46R on March 31, 2004 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Pursuant to his employment agreement entered into in October 1996, we provided an unsecured, non interest bearing loan of approximately $2.9 million to Nabors Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer. This loan is due on September 30, 2006. Pursuant to their employment agreements, Nabors and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer, and certain other key employees entered into split dollar life insurance agreements pursuant to which we pay a portion of the premiums under life insurance policies with respect to these individuals and, in certain instances, members of their families. Under these agreements, we are reimbursed for such premiums upon the occurrence of specified events, including the death of an insured individual. Any recovery of premiums paid by Nabors could potentially be limited to the cash surrender value of these policies under certain circumstances. As such, the values of these policies are recorded at their respective cash surrender values in our consolidated balance sheets. We have made premium payments to date totaling $13.2 million related to these policies. The cash surrender value of these policies of approximately $11.8 million and $11.4 million is included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the payment of premiums by Nabors under the agreements with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and with our Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer may be deemed to be prohibited loans by us to these individuals. We have paid no premiums related to our agreements with these individuals since the adoption of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and have postponed premium payments related to our agreements with these individuals. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various rig leases, rig transportation and related oilfield services agreements with our Alaskan and Saudi Arabian unconsolidated affiliates at market prices. Revenues from business transactions with these affiliated entities totaled $63.2 million, $51.3 million and $46.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Expenses from business transactions with these affiliated entities totaled $3.3 million, $3.3 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, we had accounts receivable from these affiliated entities of $20.7 million and $20.9 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We had accounts payable to these affiliated entities of $1.8 million and $.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and a note payable with one of these affiliated entities of $4.1 million and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which is included in other long term liabilities. Additionally, we own certain marine vessels that are chartered under a bareboat charter arrangement to Sea Mar Management LLC, an entity in which we own a 25% interest. Under the requirements of FIN 46R this entity was consolidated by Nabors beginning in 2004. Revenues from business transactions with Sea Mar totaled $29.5 million and $18.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Expenses from business transactions with Sea Mar totaled $47.9 million and $28.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accounts receivable from and accounts payable to Sea Mar as of December 31, 2003 totaled $3.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized 26 during the reporting period. We analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from such estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidation financial position or results of operations. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The drilling, workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive. Property, plant and equipment represented 56% of our total assets as of December 31, 2004, and depreciation constituted 12% of our total costs and other deductions for the year ended December 31, 2004. Depreciation for our primary operating assets, drilling and workover rigs, is calculated based on the units of production method over an approximate 4,900 day period, with the exception of our jack up rigs which are depreciated over an 8,030 day period, after provision for salvage value. When our drilling and workover rigs are not operating, a depreciation charge is provided using the straight line method over an assumed depreciable life of 20 years, with the exception of our jack up rigs, where a 30 year depreciable life is used. Depreciation on our buildings, well servicing rigs, oilfield hauling and mobile equipment, marine transportation and supply vessels, and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value (buildings 10 to 30 years; well servicing rigs 3 to 15 years; marine transportation and supply vessels 10 to 25 years; oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years). These depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property, plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets. Periodically, we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets. Estimation of these items requires significant management judgment. Accordingly, management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property, plant and equipment are critical. There have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets, changes in technology or other factors that indicate that these lives do not continue to be appropriate. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property, plant and equipment, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation, or the methodology applied. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter managements assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS As discussed above, the drilling, workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive, which is evident in the fact that our property, plant and equipment represented 56% of our total assets as of December 31, 2004. Other long lived assets subject to impairment consist primarily of goodwill, which represented 6% of our total assets as of December 31, 2004. We review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In addition, we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable. Such determination requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review in order to determine the future cash flows associated with the asset or, in the case of goodwill, our reporting units. These long term forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions, technological advances in the industry, and changes in regulations governing the industry. Significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. As the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long lived assets is subject to significant management judgment and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income, management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long lived assets is critical. 27 Assumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows. Given the nature of the evaluation of future cash flows and the application to specific assets and specific times, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions. INCOME TAXES Deferred taxes represent a substantial liability for Nabors. For financial reporting purposes, management determines our current tax liability as well as those taxes incurred as a result of current operations yet deferred until future periods. In accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. Currently payable taxes represent the liability related to our income tax return for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets. The changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse. In addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary, management must estimate the timing of their reversal, and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances, management has considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. These judgments and estimates are made for each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the calculation of deferred taxes is completed at that level. Further, under U.S. federal tax law, the amount and availability of loss carryforwards (and certain other tax attributes) are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests applicable to Nabors and our subsidiaries. The utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or effectively lost upon certain changes in ownership. Accordingly, although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us, no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards, or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future. These loss carryforwards are also considered in our calculation of taxes for each jurisdiction in which we operate. Additionally, we record reserves for uncertain tax positions which are subject to a significant level of management judgment related to the ultimate resolution of those tax positions. Accordingly, management believes that the estimate related to the provision for income taxes is critical to our results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect managements estimates and assumptions regarding the deferred portion of our income tax provision, including estimates of future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, the classification of timing differences as temporary or permanent, reserves recorded for uncertain tax positions, and any valuation allowance recorded as a reduction to our deferred tax assets. Managements assumptions related to the preparation of our income tax provision have historically proved to be reasonable in light of the ultimate amount tax liability due in all taxing jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our provision for income taxes was $33.4 million, consisting of $20.9 million of current tax expense and $12.5 million of deferred tax expense. Changes in managements estimates and assumptions regarding the tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes. Changes in these assumptions could potentially change the effective tax rate. A 1% change in the effective tax rate from 10% to 11% would increase the current year income tax provision by approximately $3.4 million. INSURANCE RESERVES Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well servicing industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental damage and damage to the property of others. Generally, drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer, and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements, we seek protection through insurance. However, there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible. 28 Based on the risks discussed above, it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. We maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation, employers liability, general liability and automobile liability claims. These accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims. These loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid. As the determination of our liability for insurance claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, and such liabilities could be material in nature, management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to estimate insurance reserves. For purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if the December 31, 2004 reserves for insurance were adjusted (increase or decreased) by 10%, total costs and other deductions would have changed by $9.8 million, or .5%. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED We have completed a number of large acquisitions in recent years as discussed in Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with our accounting for these acquisitions, it was necessary for us to estimate the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the various business combinations, which involved the use of various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment, and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter managements assumptions and could result in lower estimates of values of acquired assets or of future cash flows. This could result in impairment charges being recorded in our consolidated statements of income. As the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical. The determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities are based on the market for the assets and the settlement value of the liabilities. These estimates are made by management based on our experience with similar assets and liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to value assets acquired or liabilities assumed. As we have not recorded any significant impairment charges on property, plant and equipment or goodwill in either of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have proved to be reliable. Given the nature of the evaluation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the application to specific assets and liabilities, it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We may be exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business. This risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, interest rates, and marketable and non marketable security prices as discussed below. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK We operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate risk. The most significant exposures arise in connection with our operations in Canada, which usually are substantially unhedged. At various times, we utilize local currency borrowings (foreign currency denominated debt), the payment structure of customer contracts and foreign exchange contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets, liabilities, cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies. A foreign exchange contract is a foreign currency transaction, defined as an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given future date and at a specified rate. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of all our foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2004 would result in a $15.5 million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. CREDIT RISK Our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments and marketable and non marketable securities, accounts receivable, and our interest rate swap and range cap and floor transactions. Cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks or investment firms. Our investments in marketable and non marketable securities are managed within established guidelines which limit the amounts that may be invested with any one issuer and which provide guidance as to issuer credit quality. We believe that the credit risk in such instruments is minimal. In addition, our trade receivables are with a variety of U.S., international and foreign country national oil and gas companies. Management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require material collateral. We maintain reserves for potential credit losses, and such losses have been within managements expectations. INTEREST RATE, AND MARKETABLE AND NON MARKETABLE SECURITY PRICE RISK Our financial instruments that are potentially sensitive to changes in interest rates include our $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures, our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes, our 4.875% and 5.375% senior notes, our interest rate swap and range cap and floor transactions, our investments in debt securities (including corporate, asset backed, U.S. Government, Government agencies, foreign government, mortgage backed debt and mortgage CMO debt securities) and our investment in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private U.S. and non U.S. securities (including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities, global structured asset securitizations, whole loan mortgages, and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages), which are classified as non marketable securities. We may utilize derivative financial instruments that are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. The use of derivative financial instruments could expose us to further credit risk and market risk. Credit risk in this context is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty would owe us, which can create credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we would owe the counterparty, and therefore, we would not be exposed to credit risk. We attempt to minimize credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with major financial institutions that have a significant asset base. Market risk related to derivatives is the adverse effect to the value of a financial instrument that results from changes in interest rates. We try to manage market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the type and degree of market risk that we undertake. Our $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes include a contingent interest provision, discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources above, which qualifies as an embedded derivative under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 149. This embedded derivative is required to be separated from the notes and valued at its fair value at the inception of the note indenture. Any subsequent change in fair value of this embedded derivative would be recorded in our consolidated statements of income. The fair value of the contingent interest provision at inception of the note indenture was nominal. In addition, there was no significant change in the fair value of this embedded derivative through December 31, 2004, resulting in no impact on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2004. On October 21, 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a third party financial institution to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of $200 million of our fixed rate 5.375% senior notes due 2012, which has 30 been designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 149. Additionally, on October 21, 2002, we purchased a LIBOR range cap and sold a LIBOR floor, in the form of a cashless collar, with the same third party financial institution with the intention of mitigating and managing our exposure to changes in the three month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate. This transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 149, and any change in the cumulative fair value of this transaction will be reflected as a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded interest savings related to our interest rate swap agreement accounted for as a fair value hedge of $6.5 million, $6.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which served to reduce interest expense. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement is recorded as a derivative asset, included in other long term assets, and totaled approximately $4.6 million and $4.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The carrying value of our 5.375% senior notes has been increased by the same amount as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The fair value of our range cap and floor transaction is recorded as a derivative asset, included in other long term assets, and totaled approximately $.3 million as of December 31, 2004, and is recorded as a derivative liability, included in other long term liabilities, and totaled approximately $3.7 million and $3.8 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In June 2004 we unwound $100 million of the $200 million range cap and floor derivative instrument. We recorded gains of approximately $2.4 million and losses of approximately $1.1 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to this derivative instrument; such amounts are included in losses (gains) on sales of long lived assets, impairment charges and other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income. A hypothetical 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates as of December 31, 2004 would decrease the fair values of our interest rate swap, and range cap and floor, by approximately $5.6 million and $.5 million, respectively. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third party financial institutions. The carrying and fair values of our long term debt, including the current portion, are as follows: DECEMBER 31, 2004 2003 EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVE INTEREST CARRYING INTEREST CARRYING RATE VALUE FAIR VALUE RATE VALUE FAIR VALUE (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT INTEREST RATES) 4.875% senior notes due August 2009 5.00% $ 223,764 $ 232,058 4.88% $ 223,499 $ 234,585 5.375% senior notes due August 2012 3.09%(1) 277,922(2) 292,454(2) 2.91%(1) 277,248(2) 290,813(2) $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due June 2023 0% 700,000 668,581 0% 700,000 643,651 $1.381 billion zero coupon convertible senior debentures due February 2021 2.5%(3) 804,550 797,233 2.5%(3) 784,807 780,880 6.8% senior notes due April 2004 (4) N/A 6.8% 295,267 299,681 Other long term debt 0% 8.25% 4,117 4,117 $2,006,236 $1,990,326 $2,284,938 $2,253,727 (1) Includes the effect of interest savings realized from the interest rate swap executed on October 21, 2002.
