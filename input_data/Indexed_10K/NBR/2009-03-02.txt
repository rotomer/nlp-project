Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Gas. Other Services Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd., our drilling technologies and well services subsidiary, manufactures top drives, which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. Our top drives are marketed throughout the world. During the last three years, approximately 53% of our top drive sales were made to other Nabors companies. We also rent top drives and provide top drive installation, repair and maintenance services to our customers. We also offer rig instrumentation equipment, including sensors, proprietary RIGWATCH software and computerized equipment that monitors the real time performance of a rig. In addition, we specialize in daily reporting software for drilling operations, making this data available through the internet on the website www.mywells.com. We also provide mudlogging services. Canrig Drilling Technology Canada Ltd., one of our Canadian subsidiaries, manufactures catwalks and wrenches which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. During the 31 months of operations since acquisition, approximately 62% of the equipment sales were made to other Nabors companies. Ryan Energy Technologies, Inc., another one of our subsidiaries, manufactures and sells directional drilling and rig instrumentation and data collection services to oil and gas exploration and service companies. Nabors has a 50% interest in Peak Oilfield Service Company, a general partnership with a subsidiary of Cook Inlet Region, Inc., a leading Alaskan native corporation. Peak Oilfield Service Company provides heavy equipment to move drilling rigs, water, other fluids and construction materials, primarily on Alaskas North Slope and in the Cook Inlet region. The partnership also provides construction and maintenance for ice roads, pads, facilities, equipment, drill sites and pipelines. Nabors also has a 50% membership interest in Alaska Interstate Construction, L.L.C., a limited liability company whose other member is a subsidiary of Cook Inlet Region, Inc. Alaska Interstate Construction is a general contractor involved in the construction of roads, bridges, dams, drill sites and other facility sites, as well as providing mining support in Alaska. Revenues are derived from services to companies engaged in mining and public works. Our subsidiary, Peak USA Energy Services, Ltd., provides hauling and maintenance services for customers in the U.S. Lower 48 states. Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. leases aircraft used for logistics services for onshore drilling in Canada using helicopters and fixed winged aircraft. Our Employees As of December 31, 2008, Nabors employed approximately 26,912 persons, of whom approximately 3,920 were employed by unconsolidated affiliates. We believe our relationship with our employees generally is good. Certain rig employees in Argentina and Australia are represented by collective bargaining units. Seasonality Our Canadian and Alaskan drilling and workover operations are subject to seasonal variations as a result of weather conditions and generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second calendar quarter of each year. Seasonality does not have a material impact on the remaining portions of our business. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in our Canadian and Alaskan operations. Research and Development Research and development constitutes a growing part of our overall business. The effective use of technology is critical to the maintenance of our competitive position within the drilling industry. As a result of the importance of technology to our business, we expect to continue to develop technology internally or to acquire technology through strategic acquisitions. 6 Table of Contents Industry/Competitive Conditions To a large degree, Nabors businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. A sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities by our customers and could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Our industry remains competitive. Historically, the number of rigs has exceeded demand in many of our markets. From 2005 through most of 2008, as a result of improved demand for drilling services driven by a sustained increase in the level of commodity prices, supply of and demand for land drilling services have been in balance in the United States and international markets, with demand actually exceeding supply in some of our markets. This economic reality resulted in an increase in rates being charged for rigs across our North American, Offshore and International markets. Furthermore, the dramatic increase in rates along with our domestic customers willingness to enter into firm three year commitments has resulted in our building of new rigs in significant quantities for the first time in over 20 years. Internationally, we compete directly with various contractors in areas where we operate. We believe that our international markets will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future. However, as many existing rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis, competition based on price for both existing and new rigs still exists across all of our markets. In all of our geographic market areas, we believe price and availability and condition of equipment are the most significant factors in determining which drilling contractor is awarded a job. Other factors include the availability of trained personnel possessing the required specialized skills; the overall quality of service and safety record; and domestically, the ability to offer ancillary services. Increasingly, the ability to deliver rigs within certain timeframes is becoming a competitive factor. In international markets, experience in operating in certain environments and customer alliances, also have been factors in the selection of Nabors. Certain competitors are present in more than one of Nabors operating regions, although no one competitor operates in all of these areas. In the U.S. Lower 48 states, we compete with Helmerich and Payne, Inc. and Patterson UTI Energy, Inc. and there are several hundred other competitors with national, regional or local rig operations. In domestic land workover and well servicing, we compete with Basic Energy Services, Inc., Key Energy Services, Inc., Complete Energy Services and with numerous other competitors having smaller regional or local rig operations. In Canada and Offshore, Nabors competes with many firms of varying size, several of which have more significant operations in those areas than Nabors. Internationally, Nabors competes directly with various contractors at each location where it operates. Nabors believes that the market for land drilling, workover and well servicing contracts will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future. Our other operating segments represent a relatively smaller part of our business, and we have numerous competitors in each area. Our Canrig subsidiary is one of the four major manufacturers of top drives. Its largest competitors in that market are National Oilwell Varco, Tesco and MH Pyramid. Its largest competitors in the manufacture of rig instrumentation systems are Pason and National Oilwell Varcos Totco subsidiary. Mudlogging services are provided by a number of entities that serve the oil and gas industry on a regional basis. In the U.S. Lower 48 states, there are hundreds of rig transportation companies, and there are at least three or four that compete with Peak USA in each of its operating regions. In Alaska, Peak Oilfield Service principally competes with Alaska Petroleum Contractors for road, pad and pipeline maintenance, and is one of many drill site and road construction companies, the largest of which is VECO Corporation, and Alaska Interstate Construction principally competes with Wilder Construction Company and Pah River Construction for the construction of roads, bridges, dams, drill sites and other facility sites. Our Business Strategy Since 1987, with the installation of our current management team, Nabors has adhered to a consistent strategy aimed at positioning our Company to grow and prosper in good times and to mitigate adverse effects during periods of poor market conditions. We have maintained a financial posture that allows us to capitalize on market weakness and strength by adding to our business base, thereby enhancing our upside potential. The principal elements of our strategy have been to: Maintain flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet. Build cost effectively a base of premium assets. Build and maintain low operating costs through economies of scale. Develop and maintain long term, mutually attractive relationships with key customers and vendors. Build a diverse business in long term, sustainable and worthwhile geographic markets. 7 Table of Contents Recognize and seize opportunities as they arise. Continually improve safety, quality and efficiency. Implement leading edge technology where cost effective to do so. Build shareholder value by an expansion of our oil and gas reserves and production. Our business strategy is designed to allow us to grow and remain profitable in any market environment. The major developments in our business in the past three years illustrate our implementation of this strategy and its continuing success. Specifically during 2006, 2007 and the first half of 2008, we took advantage of the robust rig market in the United States and internationally to obtain a high volume of contracts for newly constructed rigs. A large proportion of these rigs are subject to long term contracts with creditworthy customers with the most significant impact occurring in our International operations. This will not only expand our operations with the latest state of the art rigs, which should better weather downturns in market activity, but eventually replace the oldest least capable rigs in our existing fleet. However, this positive trend slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the continued steady decline in natural gas and oil prices. As a result of lower commodity prices, many of our customers drilling programs have been reduced and the demand for additional rigs has been substantially reduced. Acquisitions and Divestitures We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil, gas and geothermal markets in the world. At the beginning of 1990, our fleet consisted of 44 actively marketed land drilling rigs in Canada, Alaska and in various international markets. Today, our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of approximately 528 land drilling rigs, approximately 592 domestic and 171 international land workover and well servicing rigs, 37 offshore platform rigs, 13 jack up units, 3 barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. Although Nabors continues to examine opportunities, there can be no assurance that attractive rigs or other acquisition opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in making such acquisitions in the future. On January 3, 2006, we completed an acquisition of 1183011 Alberta Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Airborne Energy Solutions Ltd., through the purchase of all common shares outstanding for cash for a total purchase price of Cdn. $41.7 million (U.S. $35.8 million). In addition, we assumed debt, net of working capital, totaling approximately Cdn. $10.0 million (U.S. $8.6 million). Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. (formerly 1183011 Alberta Ltd.) owns 42 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and owns and operates a fleet of heliportable well service equipment. The purchase price has been allocated based on final valuations of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and resulted in goodwill of approximately U.S. $18.8 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the results of our year end impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets indicated a permanent impairment to goodwill and to an intangible asset of Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. As such, we recorded a non cash impairment charge and writedown of intangible assets of $4.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition. This information is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. Nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world. We conduct oil, gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Alaska, Canada, South America, Mexico, the Caribbean, the Middle East, the Far East, Russia and Africa. Nabors also is one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the United States and Canada and is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. To further supplement and complement our primary business, we offer a wide range of ancillary well site services, including engineering, transportation, construction, maintenance, well logging, directional drilling, rig instrumentation, data collection and other support services, in selected domestic and international markets. We offer logistics services for onshore drilling in Canada using helicopter and fixed winged aircraft. We manufacture and lease or sell top drives for a broad range of drilling applications, directional drilling systems, rig instrumentation and data collection equipment, pipeline handling equipment and rig reporting software. We also invest in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities worldwide. The majority of our business is conducted through our various Contract Drilling operating segments, which include our drilling, workover and well servicing operations, on land and offshore. Our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are included in a category labeled Oil and Gas for segment reporting purposes. Our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in a category labeled Other Operating Segments for segment reporting purposes. Our businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business. The primary determinate of customer spending is the degree of their cash flow and earnings which are largely determined by natural gas prices in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and Canadian Drilling operations, while oil prices are the primary determinate in our Alaskan, International, U.S. Offshore (Gulf of Mexico), Canadian Well servicing and U.S. Land Well servicing operations. The following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per Bloomberg for the last three years: Year Ended December 31, Increase / (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 to 2007 2007 to 2006 Commodity prices: Average Henry Hub natural gas spot price ($/million cubic feet (mcf)) $ 8.89 $ 6.97 $ 6.73 $ 1.92 28 % $ 0.24 4 % Average West Texas intermediate crude oil spot price ($/barrel) $ 99.92 $ 72.23 $ 66.09 $ 27.69 38 % $ 6.14 9 % Beginning in the second half of 2008, there has been a significant decrease in natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas prices, which averaged $10.03 per mcf during the first half of 2008, declined significantly, averaging only $7.74 per mcf during the second half of 2008 and $5.84 per mcf during December 2008. The decline has continued as natural gas prices have averaged $4.96 per mcf during the period January 1, 2009 through February 23, 2009. Oil prices also declined in the second half of 2008 with average prices of $111.14 per barrel during the first half of 2008, decreasing to average prices of $88.88 per barrel during the second half of 2008 and $41.44 per barrel during December 2008. Oil prices remain depressed and have averaged $40.22 per barrel during the period January 1, 2009 through February 23, 2009. This significant decline in commodity prices has, at least in part, been driven by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. All of these factors are having an adverse effect on our customers spending plans for exploration, production and development activities which has had a significant negative impact on our operations beginning in December 2008. 20 Table of Contents Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $5.3 billion, representing an increase of $325.5 million, or 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $1.0 billion and $551.2 million ($1.93 per diluted share), respectively, representing decreases of 15% and 41%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $5.0 billion, representing an increase of $228.7 million, or 5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $1.2 billion and $930.7 million ($3.25 per diluted share), respectively, representing decreases of 13% and 9%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Our operating results were negatively impacted as a result of non cash, pre tax charges arising from oil and gas full cost ceiling test writedowns and goodwill and intangible asset impairments. Our Earnings (losses) from Unconsolidated Affiliates line in our income statement includes $228.3 million, representing our proportionate share of non cash pre tax full cost ceiling test writedowns from our U.S., international and Canadian joint ventures during the three months ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, we recorded non cash pre tax impairment charges of $21.5 million related to our wholly owned Ramshorn business unit under application of the successful efforts method of accounting related to oil and gas properties during the three months ended December 31, 2008. Charges from our U.S., international and Canadian joint ventures and our wholly owned Ramshorn business unit are included in our Oil and Gas operating segment results. Our Canada Well servicing and Drilling operating segment and Nabors Blue Sky Ltd., one of our Canadian subsidiaries reported in our Other Operating Segments include $145.4 million and $4.6 million non cash pre tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value due to the duration of the economic downturn in Canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery. Excluding these charges, our operating results were slightly higher primarily due to our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, International Drilling and Other Operating segments resulting from higher average dayrates and activity levels resulting from sustained higher natural gas and oil prices throughout 2007 and the majority of 2008, partially offset by increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense due to our capital expenditures. The decrease in our adjusted income derived from operating activities from 2006 to 2007 related primarily to our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canada Drilling and Well servicing, and our U.S. Well servicing operations, where activity levels decreased despite slightly higher natural gas prices and higher oil prices. Operating results were further negatively impacted by higher levels of depreciation expense due to our capital expenditures. Partially offsetting the decreases in our adjusted income derived from operating activities were the increases in operating results from our International operations and to a lesser extent by our Alaska operations, driven by high oil prices. In addition, our net income and earnings per share for 2007 has decreased compared to 2006 as a result of investment net losses during 2007 only partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower number of average shares outstanding. Our operating results for 2009 are expected to decrease from levels realized during 2008 given our current expectation of the continuation of lower commodity prices during 2009 and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates. The decrease in drilling activity and dayrates is expected to have a significant impact on our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and our U.S. Land Well servicing operations. In our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling operations, our rig count has decreased from its peak during October 2008 of 273 rigs to 162 rigs currently operating as of February 23, 2009. Our Well servicing activity is down approximately 45% from its October 2008 peak of 105,872 hours when compared to estimated rig hours for February 2009. We expect our International operations to increase during 2009 resulting from the deployment of additional rigs under long term contracts and the renewal of existing contracts at higher dayrates.

(10) Adjusted income derived from operating activities is computed by: subtracting direct costs, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense from Operating revenues and then adding Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. Such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income derived from operating activities, because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our Company. A reconciliation of this non GAAP measure to income from continuing operations before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the above table.

Rig years represent a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365 day period represents 0.5 rig years. (14) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates which totaled 3.5 years during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 4.0 years during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (15) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well servicing rig fleet operated during the year. Segment Results of Operations Contract Drilling Our Contract Drilling operating segments contain one or more of the following operations: drilling, workover and well servicing, on land and offshore. U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: (In thousands, except percentages Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) and rig activity) 2008 2007 2006 2008 to 2007 2007 to 2006 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 1,878,441 $ 1,710,990 $ 1,890,302 $ 167,451 10 % $ (179,312 ) (9 %) Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 628,579 $ 596,302 $ 821,821 $ 32,277 5 % $ (225,519 ) (27 %) Rig years 247.9 229.4 255.5 18.5 8 % (26.1 ) (10 %) 23 Table of Contents The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 was due to overall year over year increases in rig activity and increases in average dayrates, driven by higher natural gas prices throughout 2007 and most of 2008. This increase was only partially offset by higher operating costs and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects. The decrease in operating results from 2006 to 2007 was a result of year over year decreases in drilling activity. Additionally, the decrease in operating results was due to higher drilling rig operating costs, including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects. U.S. Land Well servicing. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: (In thousands, except percentages Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) and rig activity) 2008 2007 2006 2008 to 2007 2007 to 2006 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 758,510 $ 715,414 $ 704,189 $ 43,096 6 % $ 11,225 2 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 148,626 $ 156,243 $ 199,944 $ (7,617 ) (5 %) $ (43,701 ) (22 %) Rig hours 1,090,511 1,119,497 1,256,141 (28,986 ) (3 %) (136,644 ) (11 %) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of higher average dayrates year over year, driven by high oil prices during 2007 and the majority of 2008 as well as market expansion. Higher average dayrates were partially offset by lower rig utilization. Adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 despite higher revenues due primarily to higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects and, to a lesser extent, higher operating costs.

The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: (In thousands, except percentages Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) and rig activity) 2008 2007 2006 2008 to 2007 2007 to 2006 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 252,529 $ 212,160 $ 221,676 $ 40,369 19 % $ (9,516 ) (4 %) Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 59,179 $ 51,508 $ 65,328 $ 7,671 15 % $ (13,820 ) (21 %) Rig years 17.6 15.8 16.4 1.8 11 % (0.6 ) (4 %) The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 primarily resulted from higher average dayrates and increased drilling activity driven by high oil prices during the majority of 2008, especially in the Sundowner and Super Sundowner platform workover and re drilling rigs and the MASE platform drilling rigs. The increase in 2008 was partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense relating to new rigs added to the fleet in early 2007. The decrease in operating results from 2006 to 2007 primarily resulted from a decrease in average dayrates and utilization for our jack up rigs, partially offset by the deployment of two new built Barge and one Platform Workover Drilling rigs in early 2007. Operating results were further negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense relating to the new rigs added to the fleet. Alaska.

Drilling activity levels have increased as a result of year over year increased customer demand, driven by higher oil prices throughout 2007 and most of 2008, and the deployment and utilization of additional rigs added in late 2007. These increases have been partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense as well as increased labor and repairs and maintenance costs in 2008 and 2007 as compared to prior years. Canada.

Our operating results were further negatively impacted by proposed changes to the Alberta royalty and tax regime causing customers to assess the impact of such changes. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during 2007 and throughout the majority of 2008 positively impacted operating results, but negatively impacted demand for our services as much of our customers revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars while their costs are denominated in Canadian dollars. Additionally, operating results were negatively impacted by increased operating expenses, including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects. Operating results exclude non cash pre tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that are separately reflected in the Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment financial line in our consolidated statements of income. International. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: (In thousands, except percentages Year Ended December 31, Increase and rig activity) 2008 2007 2006 2008 to 2007 2007 to 2006 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 1,372,168 $ 1,094,802 $ 746,460 $ 277,366 25 % $ 348,342 47 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 407,675 $ 332,283 $ 208,705 $ 75,392 23 % $ 123,578 59 % Rig years 120.5 115.2 97.1 5.3 5 % 18.1 19 % The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 primarily resulted from year over year increases in average dayrates and drilling activities, reflecting strong customer demand for drilling services, stemming from sustained higher oil prices throughout 2007 and most of 2008. The increases in operating results during 2007 and 2008 were also positively impacted by an expansion of our rig fleet and continuing renewal of existing multi year contracts at higher average dayrates. These increases are partially offset by increased operating expenses, including depreciation expense related to capital expenditures for new and refurbished rigs deployed throughout 2007 and 2008. Oil and Gas This operating segment represents our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) (In thousands, except percentages) 2008 2007 2006 2008 to 2007 2007 to 2006 Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates $ (151,465 ) $ 152,320 $ 59,431 $ (303,785 ) (199 %) $ 92,889 156 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ (228,027 ) $ 56,133 $ 4,065 $ (284,160 ) (506 %) $ 52,068 n/m (1) (1) The percentage is so large that it is not meaningful. Operating results decreased from 2007 to 2008 as a result of non cash pre tax impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 by our wholly owned Ramshorn business unit and our U.S., international and Canadian joint ventures. Because of the low natural gas prices at year end, we performed an impairment test on our oil and gas properties of our wholly owned Ramshorn business unit which follows the successful efforts method of accounting. As a result, we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment to oil and gas properties which totaled $21.5 million. Our joint ventures non cash pre tax full cost ceiling test writedowns, of which our proportionate share totaled $228.3 million, resulted from the application of the full cost method of accounting for costs related to oil and natural gas properties. The full cost ceiling test limits the carrying value of the capitalized cost of the properties to the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. The full cost ceiling test is evaluated at the end of each quarter using quarter end prices of oil and natural gas, adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges. Our U.S., international and Canadian joint 25 Table of Contents ventures used a quarter end price of $5.63 per mcf for natural gas and $44.60 per barrel for oil which resulted in the ceiling test writedowns. Additionally, our proportionate share of losses from our oil and gas joint ventures included $10.0 million of depletion charges from lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells and $5.8 million of mark to market unrealized losses from derivative instruments representing forward gas sales through swaps and price floor guarantees utilizing puts. Beginning in May 2008 our U.S. joint venture began to apply hedge accounting to their forward contracts to minimize the volatility in reported earnings caused by market price fluctuations of the underlying hedged commodities. While our wholly owned Ramshorn business unit recorded approximately $21.5 million in non cash pre tax impairment charges to oil and gas properties, the charge was partially offset by income from our production volumes and oil and gas production sales as a result of higher oil and natural gas prices throughout most of 2008 and a $12.3 million gain on the sale of certain leasehold interests in 2008. The increase in our operating results from 2006 to 2007 was primarily a result of year over year increases in income attributable to earnings related to production payment contracts and gains totaling $88 million recognized on the sale of certain properties during 2007. Additionally, operating results were higher year over year due to increases in production and increases in oil, gas and natural gas liquid prices. These increases to operating results were partially offset by a $33.6 million increase in depletion expense and approximately $3.9 million in net losses from our joint ventures which commenced operations in 2007, as well as higher seismic costs and workover expenses compared to the prior year. The higher depletion expense resulted from increased units of production depletion and impairment charges, related to higher costs and lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells. Other Operating Segments These operations include our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations. The results of operations for these operating segments are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase (In thousands, except percentages) 2008 2007 2006 2008 to 2007 2007 to 2006 Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 683,186 $ 588,483 $ 505,286 $ 94,703 16 % $ 83,197 16 % Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities $ 68,572 $ 35,273 $ 30,028 $ 33,299 94 % $ 5,245 17 % The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 primarily resulted from year over year increased third party sales and higher margins on top drives driven by the strengthening of the oil drilling market and increased equipment sales and increased market share in Canada and increased demand in the U.S. directional drilling market. Results for construction and logistics services increased from 2007 to 2008 due to increases in customer demand for our construction and logistics services in Alaska but decreased from 2006 to 2007 due to lower demand for our services. Discontinued Operations During the third quarter of 2007 we sold our Sea Mar business which had previously been included in Other Operating Segments to an unrelated third party. The assets included 20 offshore supply vessels and certain related assets, including a right under a vessel construction contract. The operating results of this business for all periods presented are retroactively presented and accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of income.
