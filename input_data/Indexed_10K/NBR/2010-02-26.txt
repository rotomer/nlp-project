Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Oil and Gas. Other Services Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd., our drilling technologies and well services subsidiary, manufactures top drives, which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. We market our top drives throughout the world. During the last three years, approximately 41% of our top drive sales were made to other Nabors companies. We also rent top drives and catwalks, and provide installation, repair and maintenance services to our customers. We also offer rig instrumentation equipment, including proprietary RIGWATCHtm software and computerized equipment that monitors a rigs real time performance. Our directional drilling system, ROCKITtm, is experiencing high growth in the marketplace. In addition, we specialize in daily reporting software for drilling operations, making this data available through the internet. We also provide mudlogging services. Canrig Drilling Technology Canada Ltd., one of our Canadian subsidiaries, manufactures catwalks which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. During the last three years, approximately 63% of our equipment sales were made to other Nabors companies. Ryan Energy Technologies, Inc., another one of our subsidiaries, manufactures and sells directional drilling and rig instrumentation equipment and provides data collection services to oil and gas exploration and service companies. Nabors has a 50% ownership interest in Peak Oilfield Service Company, a general partnership with a subsidiary of Cook Inlet Region, Inc., a leading Alaskan native corporation. Peak Oilfield Service Company provides heavy equipment to move drilling rigs, water, other fluids and construction materials, primarily on Alaskas North Slope and in the Cook Inlet region. The partnership also provides construction and maintenance for ice roads, pads, facilities, equipment, drill sites and pipelines. Nabors also has a 50% membership interest in Alaska Interstate Construction, L.L.C., a general contractor involved in the construction of roads, bridges, dams, drill sites and other facility sites, as well as the provision of mining support in Alaska; the other member of Alaska Interstate Construction, L.L.C. is a subsidiary of Cook Inlet Region, Inc. Revenues are derived from services to companies engaged in mining and public works. Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. leases aircraft used for logistics services for onshore drilling in Canada using helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Our Employees As of December 31, 2009, Nabors employed approximately 18,390 persons, of whom approximately 3,148 were employed by unconsolidated affiliates. We believe our relationship with our employees is generally good. Some rig employees in Argentina and Australia are represented by collective bargaining units. Seasonality Our Canadian and Alaskan drilling and workover operations are subject to seasonal variations as a result of weather conditions and generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second quarter of each year. Global warming could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Seasonality does not materially impact the remaining portions of our business. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in our Canadian and Alaskan operations. Research and Development Research and development constitutes a growing part of our overall business. The effective use of technology is critical to maintaining our competitive position within the drilling industry. We expect to continue developing technology internally and acquiring technology through strategic acquisitions. 7 Table of Contents Industry/Competitive Conditions To a large degree, Nabors businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. A sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities by our customers and could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Our industry remains competitive. Historically, the number of available rigs has exceeded demand in many of our markets. The land drilling, workover and well servicing market is generally more competitive than the offshore market due to the larger number of rigs and market participants. From 2005 through most of 2008, demand was strong for drilling services driven by a sustained increase in the level of commodity prices; supply of and demand for land drilling services were in balance in the United States and international markets, with demand actually exceeding supply in some of our markets. This resulted in an increase in rates being charged for rigs across our North American, Offshore and International markets. In late 2008, falling oil prices and the declines in natural gas prices forced a curtailment of drilling related expenditures by many companies and resulted in an oversupply of rigs in the markets where we operate. During 2009, this continued decline in drilling and related activity impacted our key markets. Although many rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis, competition increases based on the price and supply of existing and new rigs across all of our markets. In all of our geographic markets, we believe price and the availability and condition of equipment are the most significant factors in determining which drilling contractor is awarded a job. Other factors include the availability of trained personnel possessing the required specialized skills; the overall quality of service and safety record; and the ability to offer ancillary services. Increasingly, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features is becoming a competitive factor. In international markets, experience in operating in certain environments, as well as customer alliances have been factors in the selection of Nabors. Certain competitors are present in more than one of Nabors operating regions, although no one competitor operates in all of these areas. In the U.S. Lower 48 states, we compete with Helmerich and Payne, Inc. and Patterson UTI Energy, Inc., and several hundred other competitors with national, regional or local rig operations. In domestic land workover and well servicing, we compete with Basic Energy Services, Inc., Key Energy Services, Inc., Complete Energy Services and with numerous other competitors having smaller regional or local rig operations. In Canada and Offshore, we compete with many firms of varying size, several of which have more significant operations in those areas than Nabors. Internationally, we compete directly with various contractors at each location where we operate. We believe that the market for land drilling, workover and well servicing contracts will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future. Our other operating segments represent a relatively smaller part of our business, and we have numerous competitors in each area. Our Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd. subsidiary is one of the four major manufacturers of top drives. Its largest competitors in that market are National Oilwell Varco, Tesco and MH Pyramid. Its largest competitors in the manufacture of rig instrumentation systems are Pason and National Oilwell Varcos Totco subsidiary. Mudlogging services are provided by a number of entities that serve the oil and gas industry on a regional basis. In the U.S. Lower 48 states, there are hundreds of rig transportation companies in each of our operating regions. In Alaska, Peak Oilfield Service principally competes with Alaska Petroleum Contractors for road, pad and pipeline maintenance, and is one of many drill site and road construction companies, the largest of which is VECO Corporation, and Alaska Interstate Construction principally competes with Granite Construction Company, NANA and Pah River Construction for the construction of roads, bridges, dams, drill sites and other facility sites. Our Business Strategy Since 1987, with the installation of our current management team, we have adhered to a consistent strategy aimed at positioning Nabors to grow and prosper in times of good market conditions and to mitigate 8 Table of Contents adverse effects during periods of poor market conditions. We have maintained a financial posture that allows us to capitalize on market weakness and strength by adding to our business base, thereby enhancing our upside potential. The principal elements of our strategy have been to: Maintain flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet. Build cost effectively a base of premium assets. Build and maintain low operating costs through economies of scale. Develop and maintain long term, mutually attractive relationships with key customers and vendors. Build a diverse business in long term, sustainable and worthwhile geographic markets. Recognize and seize opportunities as they arise. Continually improve safety, quality and efficiency. Implement leading edge technology where cost effective to do so. Build shareholder value by expanding our oil and gas reserves and production. Our business strategy is designed to allow us to grow and remain profitable in any market environment. The major developments in our business in recent years illustrate our implementation of this strategy and its continuing success. Beginning in 2005, we took advantage of the robust rig market in the United States and internationally to obtain a high volume of contracts for newly constructed rigs. A large proportion of these rigs are subject to long term contracts with creditworthy customers with the most significant impact occurring in our International operations. This will not only expand our operations with the latest state of the art rigs, which should better weather downturns in market activity, but eventually replace the oldest and least capable rigs in our existing fleet. However, this positive trend in the rig market slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout much of 2009, due to the continued steady decline in natural gas and oil prices. As a result of lower commodity prices, many of our customers drilling programs were reduced and the demand for additional rigs was substantially reduced. Although we expect market conditions to remain challenging during 2010, we believe the deployment of our newer and higher margin rigs under long term contracts will enhance our competitive position when market conditions improve. Acquisitions and Divestitures We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil, gas and geothermal markets in the world. At the beginning of 1990, our fleet consisted of 44 actively marketed land drilling rigs in Canada, Alaska and in various international markets. Today, our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of approximately 542 land drilling rigs, approximately 558 rigs for land workover and well servicing work in the United States and 172 rigs for land workover and well servicing work in Canada, 40 offshore platform rigs, 13 jack up units, 3 barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. Although Nabors continues to examine opportunities, there can be no assurance that attractive rigs or other acquisition opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in making such acquisitions in the future. On January 3, 2006, we completed an acquisition of 1183011 Alberta Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Airborne Energy Solutions Ltd., through the purchase of all common shares outstanding for cash for a total purchase price of Cdn.$41.7 million (U.S. $35.8 million). In addition, we assumed debt, net of working capital, totaling approximately Cdn.$10.0 million (U.S. $8.6 million). On this date, Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. (formerly 1183011 Alberta Ltd.) owned 42 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and owned and operated a fleet of heliportable well service equipment. The purchase price was allocated based on final valuations of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and resulted in goodwill of approximately U.S. $18.8 million. During 2008 and 2009, the results of our impairment tests of goodwill and 9 Table of Contents intangible assets indicated a permanent impairment to goodwill and to an intangible asset of Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. As such, the goodwill has been fully impaired as of December 31, 2009. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition. This information is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world, with approximately 542 actively marketed land drilling rigs. We conduct oil, gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Alaska, Canada, South America, Mexico, the Caribbean, the Middle East, the Far East, Russia and Africa. We are also one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the United States and Canada. We actively market approximately 558 rigs for land workover and well servicing work in the United States, primarily in the southwestern and western United States, and approximately 172 rigs for land workover and well servicing work in Canada. Nabors is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs, and actively markets 40 platform, 13 jack up and 3 barge rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. These rigs provide well servicing, workover and drilling services. We have a 51% ownership interest in a joint venture in Saudi Arabia, which owns and actively markets 9 rigs in addition to the rigs we lease to the joint venture. We also offer a wide range of ancillary well site services, including engineering, transportation, construction, maintenance, well logging, directional drilling, rig instrumentation, data collection and other support services in select domestic and international markets. We provide logistics services for onshore drilling in Canada using helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. We manufacture and lease or sell top drives for a broad range of drilling applications, directional drilling systems, rig instrumentation and data collection equipment, pipeline handling equipment and rig reporting software. We also invest in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the U.S., Canada and international areas through both our wholly owned subsidiaries and our separate joint venture entities. We hold a 50% ownership interest in our Canadian entity and 49.7% ownership interests in our U.S. and International entities. Each joint venture pursues development and exploration projects with our existing customers and with other operators in a variety of forms, including operated and non operated working interests, joint ventures, farm outs and acquisitions. The majority of our business is conducted through our various Contract Drilling operating segments, which include our drilling, workover and well servicing operations, on land and offshore. Our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are included in our Oil and Gas operating segment. Our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in our Other Operating Segments. Our businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business. The primary determinate of customer spending is their cash flow and earnings which are largely driven by natural gas prices in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and Canadian Drilling operations, while oil prices are the primary determinate in our Alaskan, International, U.S. Offshore (Gulf of Mexico), Canadian Well servicing 24 Table of Contents and U.S. Land Well servicing operations. The following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per Bloomberg for the last three years: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 Commodity prices: Average Henry Hub natural gas spot price ($/million cubic feet (mcf)) $ 3.94 $ 8.89 $ 6.97 $ (4.95 ) (56 )% $ 1.92 28 % Average West Texas intermediate crude oil spot price ($/barrel) $ 61.99 $ 99.92 $ 72.23 $ (37.93 ) (38 )% $ 27.69 38 % Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, there was a significant reduction in the demand for natural gas and oil that was caused, at least in part, by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. Weaker demand throughout 2009 has resulted in sustained lower natural gas and oil prices. The price of natural gas reached a low for 2009 of $1.83 per mcf during September and while showing improvement remains depressed, having averaged $3.77 per mcf during the second half of 2009. The significant drop in the price of oil reached a low for 2009 of $33.98 per barrel in February with continuous recovery throughout 2009, averaging $72.08 per barrel during the second half of 2009. These reduced prices for natural gas and oil have led to a sharp decline in the demand for drilling and workover services. Continued fluctuations in the demand for gas and oil, among other factors including supply, could contribute to continued price volatility which may continue to affect demand for our services and could materially affect our future financial results. Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $3.5 billion, representing a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 34% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income (loss) attributable to Nabors for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $356.2 million and $(85.5) million ($(.30) per diluted share), respectively, representing decreases of 66% and 118%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $5.3 billion, representing an increase of $325.5 million, or 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income (loss) attributable to Nabors for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $1.1 billion and $475.7 million ($1.65 per diluted share), respectively, representing decreases of 16% and 45%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. During 2009 and 2008, our operating results were negatively impacted as a result of charges arising from oil and gas full cost ceiling test writedowns and other impairments. Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates includes $(237.1) million and $(228.3) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, representing our proportionate share of full cost ceiling test writedowns from our unconsolidated oil and gas joint ventures which utilize the full cost method of accounting. During 2009, our joint ventures used a 12 month average price in the ceiling test calculation as required by the revised SEC rules whereas during 2008, the ceiling test calculation used the single day, year end commodity price that, at December 31, 2008, was near its low point for that year. The full cost ceiling test writedowns are included in our Oil and Gas operating segment results. During 2009 and 2008, our operating results were also negatively impacted as a result of our impairments and other charges of $339.1 million and $176.1 million, respectively. During 2009, impairments and other charges included recognition of other than temporary impairments of $54.3 million relating to our available for sale securities, and impairments of $64.2 million to long lived assets that were retired from our U.S. Offshore, Alaska, Canada and International contract drilling segments. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $205.9 million and $21.5 million, respectively, to our wholly owned Ramshorn business unit under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for some of our oil and gas related assets during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. During 2008, impairments and other charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $154.6 million recorded by our Canada Well servicing and Drilling operating segment and Nabors Blue Sky Ltd., one of our Canadian subsidiaries reported in Other 25 Table of Contents Operating Segments. We recognized these goodwill and intangible asset impairments to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. We consider these writedowns necessary because of the duration of the industry downturn in Canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery. These impairments and other charges are reflected separately as impairments and other charges in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Excluding these charges, our operating results were lower than the previous year results primarily due to the continuing weak environment in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, U.S. Land Well servicing, Canada and U.S. Offshore operations where activity levels and demand for our drilling rigs have decreased substantially in response to uncertainty in the financial markets and commodity price deterioration. Operating results have been further negatively impacted by higher levels of depreciation expense due to our increased capital expenditures in recent years. Our operating results for 2010 are expected to approximate levels realized during 2009 given our current expectation of the continuation of lower commodity prices during 2010 and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates. We expect the decrease in drilling activity and dayrates to continue to adversely impact our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and our U.S. Land Well servicing operations for 2010, as compared to 2009, because the number of working rigs and average dayrates have declined. We expect our International operations to decrease slightly during 2010 as a result of lower drilling activity and utilization partially offset by the deployment of new and incremental rigs under long term contracts and the renewal of multi year contracts. Although rig count is expected to be lower overall, the reductions are primarily comprised of lower yielding assets, leaving higher margin contracts in place partially offset by certain contracts rolling over at lower current market rates. Our investments in new and upgraded rigs over the past five years have resulted in long term contracts which we expect will enhance our competitive position when market conditions improve. The following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Reportable segments: Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates from continuing operations:(1) Contract Drilling:(2) U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling $ 1,082,531 $ 1,878,441 $ 1,710,990 $ (795,910 ) (42 )% $ 167,451 10 % U.S. Land Well servicing 412,243 758,510 715,414 (346,267 ) (46 )% 43,096 6 % U.S. Offshore 157,305 252,529 212,160 (95,224 ) (38 )% 40,369 19 % Alaska 204,407 184,243 152,490 20,164 11 % 31,753 21 % Canada 298,653 502,695 545,035 (204,042 ) (41 )% (42,340 ) (8 )% International 1,265,097 1,372,168 1,094,802 (107,071 ) (8 )% 277,366 25 % Subtotal Contract Drilling(3) 3,420,236 4,948,586 4,430,891 (1,528,350 ) (31 )% 517,695 12 % Oil and Gas(4)(5) (209,091 ) (151,465 ) 152,320 (57,626 ) (38 )% (303,785 ) (199 )% Other Operating Segments(6)(7) 446,282 683,186 588,483 (236,904 ) (35 )% 94,703 16 % Other reconciling items(8) (179,752 ) (198,245 ) (215,122 ) 18,493 9 % 16,877 8 % Total $ 3,477,675 $ 5,282,062 $ 4,956,572 $ (1,804,387 ) (34 )% $ 325,490 7 % 26 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities from continuing operations:(1)(9) Contract Drilling: U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling $ 294,679 $ 628,579 $ 596,302 $ (333,900 ) (53 )% $ 32,277 5 % U.S. Land Well servicing 28,950 148,626 156,243 (119,676 ) (81 )% (7,617 ) (5 )% U.S. Offshore 30,508 59,179 51,508 (28,671 ) (48 )% 7,671 15 % Alaska 62,742 52,603 37,394 10,139 19 % 15,209 41 % Canada (7,019 ) 61,040 87,046 (68,059 ) (111 )% (26,006 ) (30 )% International 365,566 407,675 332,283 (42,109 ) (10 )% 75,392 23 % Subtotal Contract Drilling(3) 775,426 1,357,702 1,260,776 (582,276 ) (43 )% 96,926 8 % Oil and Gas(4)(5) (256,535 ) (206,490 ) 97,150 (50,045 ) (24 )% (303,640 ) (313 )% Other Operating Segments(7)(8) 34,120 68,572 35,273 (34,452 ) (50 )% 33,299 94 % Other reconciling items(10) (196,844 ) (167,831 ) (138,302 ) (29,013 ) (17 )% (29,529 ) (21 )% Total $ 356,167 $ 1,051,953 $ 1,254,897 $ (695,786 ) (66 )% $ (202,944 ) (16 )% Interest expense (264,948 ) (196,718 ) (154,920 ) (68,230 ) (35 )% (41,798 ) (27 )% Investment income (loss) 25,756 21,726 (15,891 ) 4,030 19 % 37,617 237 % Gains (losses) on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income (expense), net (12,962 ) (15,027 ) (11,315 ) 2,065 14 % (3,712 ) (33 )% Impairments and other charges(11) (339,129 ) (176,123 ) (41,017 ) (163,006 ) (93 )% (135,106 ) (329 )% Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (235,116 ) 685,811 1,031,754 (920,927 ) (134 )% (345,943 ) (34 )% Income tax expense (benefit) (149,228 ) 206,147 201,496 (355,375 ) (172 )% (4,651 ) (2 )% Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax (85,888 ) 479,664 830,258 (565,552 ) (118 )% (350,594 ) (42 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 35,024 (35,024 ) (100 )% Net income (loss) (85,888 ) 479,664 865,282 (565,552 ) (118 )% (385,618 ) (45 )% Less: Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 342 (3,927 ) 420 4,269 109 % (4,347 ) N/M (15) Net income (loss) attributable to Nabors $ (85,546 ) $ 475,737 $ 865,702 $ (561,283 ) (118 )% $ (389,965 ) (45 )% 27 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Rig activity: Rig years:(12) U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling 149.4 247.9 229.4 (98.5 ) (40 )% 18.5 8 % U.S. Offshore 11.0 17.6 15.8 (6.6 ) (38 )% 1.8 11 % Alaska 10.0 10.9 8.7 (0.9 ) (8 )% 2.2 25 % Canada 19.7 35.5 36.7 (15.8 ) (45 )% (1.2 ) (3 )% International(13) 100.2 120.5 115.2 (20.3 ) (17 )% 5.3 5 % Total rig years 290.3 432.4 405.8 (142.1 ) (33 )% 26.6 7 % Rig hours:(14) U.S. Land Well servicing 590,878 1,090,511 1,119,497 (499,633 ) (46 )% (28,986 ) (3 )% Canada Well servicing 143,824 248,032 283,471 (104,208 ) (42 )% (35,439 ) (13 )% Total rig hours 734,702 1,338,543 1,402,968 (603,841 ) (45 )% (64,425 ) (5 )% (1) All segment information excludes the Sea Mar business, which has been classified as a discontinued operation.

However, management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities, because it believes that these financial measures are an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our Company. A reconciliation of this non GAAP measure to income (loss) before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided within the above table. (10) Represents the elimination of inter segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses. (11) Represents impairments and other charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (12) Excludes well servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Rig years represent a measure of the number of 28 Table of Contents equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365 day period represents 0.5 rig years. (13) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates which totaled 2.5 years, 3.5 years and 4.0 years during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. (14) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well servicing rig fleet operated during the year. (15) The percentage is so large that is not meaningful. Segment Results of Operations Contract Drilling Our Contract Drilling operating segments contain one or more of the following operations: drilling, workover and well servicing, on land and offshore. U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 1,082,531 $ 1,878,441 $ 1,710,990 $ (795,910 ) (42 )% $ 167,451 10 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 294,679 $ 628,579 $ 596,302 $ (333,900 ) (53 )% $ 32,277 5 % Rig years 149.4 247.9 229.4 (98.5 ) (40 )% 18.5 8 % Operating results decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to a decline in drilling activity, driven by lower natural gas prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and diminished demand as customers released rigs and delayed drilling projects in response to the significant drop in natural gas prices and the tightening of the credit markets. Operating results were further negatively impacted by higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects completed in recent years. The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 was due to overall year over year increases in rig activity and increases in average dayrates, driven by higher natural gas prices throughout 2007 and most of 2008. This increase was only partially offset by higher operating costs and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects. U.S. Land Well servicing. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 412,243 $ 758,510 $ 715,414 $ (346,267 ) (46 )% $ 43,096 6 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 28,950 $ 148,626 $ 156,243 $ (119,676 ) (81 )% $ (7,617 ) (5 )% Rig hours 590,878 1,090,511 1,119,497 (499,633 ) (46 )% (28,986 ) (3 )% Operating results decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to lower rig utilization and price erosion, driven by lower customer demand for our services due to relatively lower oil prices caused by the U.S. economic recession and reduced end product demand. Operating results were further negatively impacted by higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects completed in recent years. Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily as a result of higher average dayrates year over year, driven by high oil prices during 2007 and the majority of 29 Table of Contents 2008 as well as market expansion. Higher average dayrates were partially offset by lower rig utilization. Adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from 2007 to 2008 despite higher revenues due primarily to higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects and, to a lesser extent, higher operating costs. U.S. Offshore. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 157,305 $ 252,529 $ 212,160 $ (95,224 ) (38 )% $ 40,369 19 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 30,508 $ 59,179 $ 51,508 $ (28,671 ) (48 )% $ 7,671 15 % Rig years 11.0 17.6 15.8 (6.6 ) (38 )% 1.8 11 % The decrease in operating results from 2008 to 2009 primarily resulted from lower average dayrates and utilization for the SuperSundownertm platform rigs, workover jack up rigs, barge drilling and workover rigs, and Sundowner platform rigs, partially offset by higher utilization of our MODS rigs inclusive of a significant term contract for a MODS rig deployed in January 2009. The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 primarily resulted from higher average dayrates and increased drilling activity driven by high oil prices during the majority of 2008, especially in the Sundowner and Super Sundowner platform workover and re drilling rigs and the MASE platform drilling rigs. The increase in 2008 was partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense relating to new rigs added to the fleet in early 2007. Alaska. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 204,407 $ 184,243 $ 152,490 $ 20,164 11 % $ 31,753 21 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 62,742 $ 52,603 $ 37,394 $ 10,139 19 % $ 15,209 41 % Rig years 10.0 10.9 8.7 (0.9 ) (8 )% 2.2 25 % The increases in operating results from 2008 to 2009 and from 2007 to 2008 were primarily due to increases in average dayrates and drilling activity. Although drilling activity levels decreased slightly during 2009, operating results reflect the higher average margins as a result of the addition of some high specification rig work. Drilling activity levels increased in 2008 as a result of the deployment and utilization of rigs added to the fleet in late 2007 under long term contracts. The increases during 2009 and 2008 have been partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense as well as increased labor and repairs and maintenance costs in 2009 and 2008 as compared to prior years. 30 Table of Contents Canada. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 298,653 $ 502,695 $ 545,035 $ (204,042 ) (41 )% $ (42,340 ) (8 )% Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities $ (7,019 ) $ 61,040 $ 87,046 $ (68,059 ) (111 )% $ (26,006 ) (30 )% Rig years Drilling 19.7 35.5 36.7 (15.8 ) (45 )% (1.2 ) (3 )% Rig hours Well servicing 143,824 248,032 283,471 (104,208 ) (42 )% (35,439 ) (13 )% Operating results decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily as a result of an overall decrease in drilling and well servicing activity due to lower natural gas prices driving a significant decline of customer demand for drilling and well servicing operations. Our operating results for 2009 were further negatively impacted by the economic uncertainty in the Canadian drilling market and financial market instability. The Canadian dollar began 2009 in a weak position versus the U.S. dollar, during a period of time when drilling and well servicing activity was typically at its seasonal peak, which also had an overall negative impact on operating results. These decreases in operating results were partially offset by cost reductions in direct costs, general and administrative expenses and depreciation. The decrease in operating results from 2007 to 2008 resulted from year over year decreases in drilling and well servicing activity and decreases in average dayrates for drilling and well servicing operations as a result of economic uncertainty and Albertas tight labor market which led to a number of projects being delayed. Our operating results were further negatively impacted by proposed changes to the Alberta royalty and tax regime causing customers to assess the impact of such changes. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during 2007 and throughout the majority of 2008 positively impacted operating results, but negatively impacted demand for our services as much of our customers revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars while their costs are denominated in Canadian dollars. Additionally, operating results were negatively impacted by increased operating expenses, including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects. International. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages and rig activity) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 1,265,097 $ 1,372,168 $ 1,094,802 $ (107,071 ) (8 )% $ 277,366 25 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 365,566 $ 407,675 $ 332,283 $ (42,109 ) (10 )% $ 75,392 23 % Rig years 100.2 120.5 115.2 (20.3 ) (17 )% 5.3 5 % The decrease in operating results from 2008 to 2009 resulted primarily from year over year decreases in average dayrates and lower utilization of rigs in Mexico, Libya, Argentina and Colombia, driven by weakening customer demand for drilling services stemming from the drop in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 which continued throughout 2009. Operating results were further negatively impacted by higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects completed in recent years. These decreases were partially offset by higher average dayrates from two jack up rigs deployed in Saudi Arabia, increases in average dayrates for our new and incremental rigs added and deployed during 2008 and a start up floating, drilling, production, storage and offloading vessel off the coast of the Republic of the Congo. The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 primarily resulted from year over year increases in average dayrates and drilling activities, reflecting strong customer demand for drilling services, stemming from 31 Table of Contents sustained higher oil prices throughout 2007. Operating results during 2007 and most of 2008 were also positively impacted by an expansion of our rig fleet and continuing renewal of existing multi year contracts at higher average dayrates. These increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses, including depreciation expense related to capital expenditures for new and refurbished rigs deployed throughout 2007 and 2008. Oil and Gas. The results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates $ (209,091 ) $ (151,465 ) $ 152,320 $ (57,626 ) (38 )% $ (303,785 ) (199 )% Adjusted income (loss) derived from operating activities $ (256,535 ) $ (206,490 ) $ 97,150 $ (50,045 ) (24 )% $ (303,640 ) (313 )% Our operating results decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily as a result of full cost ceiling test writedowns recorded during 2009 by our unconsolidated joint ventures. During 2009, our U.S., international and Canadian oil and gas joint ventures recorded full cost ceiling test writedowns, of which our proportionate share totaled $237.1 million. These writedowns resulted from the application of the full cost method of accounting for costs related to oil and natural gas properties. The full cost ceiling test limits the carrying value of the capitalized cost of the properties to the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. The full cost ceiling test was evaluated using the 12 month average commodity price as required by the revised SEC rules. Operating results further decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to declines in natural gas prices and production volumes from our Ramshorn and joint venture operations. Additionally, operating results for 2008 included a $12.3 million gain recorded on the sale of leasehold interests. Our operating results decreased from 2007 to 2008 as a result of full cost ceiling test writedowns recorded during 2008 by our unconsolidated oil and gas joint ventures. During 2008, our U.S., international and Canadian oil and gas joint ventures recorded full cost ceiling test writedowns, of which our proportionate share totaled $228.3 million. The full cost ceiling test was determined using the single day, year end price as required by SEC rules at the time. Additionally during 2008, our proportionate share of losses from our unconsolidated oil and gas joint ventures included $10.0 million of depletion charges from lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells and $5.8 million of mark to market unrealized losses from derivative instruments representing forward gas sales through swaps and price floor guarantees utilizing puts. Beginning in May 2008 our U.S. joint venture began to apply hedge accounting to its forward contracts to minimize the volatility in reported earnings caused by market price fluctuations of the underlying hedged commodities. These losses were partially offset by income from our production volumes and oil and gas production sales as a result of higher oil and natural gas prices throughout most of 2008 and a $12.3 million gain on the sale of leasehold interests in 2008. 32 Table of Contents Other Operating Segments These operations include our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations. The results of operations for these operating segments are as follows: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) Operating revenues and Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates $ 446,282 $ 683,186 $ 588,483 $ (236,904 ) (35 )% $ 94,703 16 % Adjusted income derived from operating activities $ 34,120 $ 68,572 $ 35,273 $ (34,452 ) (50 )% $ 33,299 94 % The decreases in operating results from 2008 to 2009 primarily resulted from (i) lower demand in the U.S. and Canadian drilling markets for rig instrumentation and data collection services from oil and gas exploration companies, (ii) decreases in customer demand for our construction and logistics services in Alaska and (iii) decreased capital equipment unit volumes and lower service and rental activity as a result of the slowdown in the oil and gas industry. The increase in operating results from 2007 to 2008 primarily resulted from year over year increases in third party sales and higher margins on top drives occasioned by the strengthening of the oil drilling market, increased equipment sales, increased market share in Canada and increased demand in the U.S. directional drilling market. Results were also improved in 2008 due to increases in customer demand for our construction and logistics services in Alaska. Discontinued Operations In 2007, we sold our Sea Mar business which had previously been included in Other Operating Segments to an unrelated third party. The assets included 20 offshore supply vessels and some related assets, including rights under a vessel construction contract. We have not had any continuing involvement subsequent to the sale of this business and have accounted for the Sea Mar business as discontinued operations in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of income (loss). Our condensed statement of income from discontinued operations related to the Sea Mar business for the year ended December 31, 2007 was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) Revenues $ 58,887 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 35,024 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION General and administrative expenses Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) General and administrative expenses $ 429,663 $ 479,984 $ 436,282 $ (50,321 ) (10 )% $ 43,702 10 % General and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues 11.6 % 8.7 % 8.8 % 2.9 % 33 % (.1 )% (1 %) General and administrative expenses decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily as a result of significant decreases in wage related expenses and other cost reduction efforts across all business units, partially offset by an increase of approximately $61.2 million in stock compensation expense. During 2009, share based compensation expense included $72.1 million of compensation expense related to previously granted restricted stock and option awards held by Messrs. Isenberg and Petrello that was unrecognized as of April 1, 2009. The recognition of this expense resulted from provisions of their respective new employment agreements that 33 Table of Contents effectively eliminated the risk of forfeiture of such awards. There is no remaining unrecognized expense related to their outstanding restricted stock and option awards. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues increased primarily due to lower revenues. General and administrative expenses increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily as a result of increases in wages and wage related expenses for a majority of our operating segments compared to each prior year, which resulted from an increase in the number of employees required to support higher activity levels. The increase was also driven by higher compensation expense, primarily resulting from higher bonuses and non cash compensation expenses recorded for restricted stock awards during 2007 and 2008. Depreciation and amortization, and depletion expense Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) Depreciation and amortization expense $ 668,415 $ 614,367 $ 469,669 $ 54,048 9 % $ 144,698 31 % Depletion expense $ 11,078 $ 25,442 $ 31,165 $ (14,364 ) (56 )% $ (5,723 ) (18 )% Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from 2008 to 2009 and from 2007 to 2008 primarily as a result of projects completed in recent years under our expanded capital expenditure program that commenced in early 2005. Depletion expense. Depletion expense decreased from 2008 to 2009 and from 2007 to 2008 primarily as a result of decreased natural gas production volumes during each year. Interest expense Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest expense $ 264,948 $ 196,718 $ 154,920 $ 68,230 35 % $ 41,798 27 % Interest expense increased from 2008 to 2009 as a result of the interest expense related to our January 2009 issuance of 9.25% senior notes due January 2019. The increase was partially offset by a reduction to interest expense due to our repurchases of approximately $1.1 billion par value of 0.94% senior exchangeable notes during 2008 and 2009. Interest expense increased from 2007 to 2008 as a result of the additional interest expense related to our February 2008 and July 2008 issuances of 6.15% senior notes due February 2018 in the amounts of $575 million and $400 million, respectively. Investment income (loss) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) Investment income (loss) $ 25,756 $ 21,726 $ (15,891 ) $ 4,030 19 % $ 37,617 237 % Investment income during 2009 was $25.8 million compared to $21.7 million during the prior year. Investment income in 2009 included net unrealized gains of $9.8 million from our trading securities and interest and dividend income of $15.9 million from our cash, other short term and long term investments. Investment income during 2008 was $21.7 million compared to a net investment loss of $15.9 million during the prior year. Investment income in 2008 included net unrealized gains of $8.5 million from our trading securities and interest and dividend income of $40.5 million from our short term and long term investments, partially offset by losses of $27.4 million from our actively managed funds classified as long term investments. 34 Table of Contents Investment income (loss) during 2007 included a net loss of $61.4 million from our actively managed funds classified as long term investments inclusive of substantial gains from sales of our marketable equity securities. This net loss was offset by interest and dividend income of $45.5 million from our short term investments.

These losses were partially offset by pre tax gains of $11.5 million recognized on purchases of $964.8 million par value of our 0.94% senior exchangeable notes due 2011. The amount of gains (losses) on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income(expense), net for 2008 represents a net loss of $15.0 million and includes: (i) losses on derivative instruments of approximately $14.6 million, including a $9.9 million loss on a three month written put option and a $4.7 million loss on the fair value of our range cap and floor derivative, (ii) losses on retirements on long lived assets of approximately $13.2 million, inclusive of involuntary conversion losses on long lived assets of approximately $12.0 million, net of insurance recoveries, related to damage sustained from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike during 2008, and (iii) increases of litigation expenses of $3.5 million. These losses were partially offset by a $12.2 million pre tax gain recognized on our purchase of $100 million par value of 0.94% senior exchangeable notes due 2011. The amount of gains (losses) on sales and retirements of long lived assets and other income(expense), net for 2007 represents a net loss of $11.3 million and includes: (i) losses on retirements and impairment charges on long lived assets of approximately $40.0 million and (ii) increases of litigation expenses of $9.6 million. These losses were partially offset by the $38.6 million gain on the sale of three accommodation jack up rigs in the second quarter of 2007. Impairments and Other Charges Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 to 2008 2008 to 2007 (In thousands, except percentages) Goodwill impairments $ 14,689 $ 150,008 $ $ (135,319 ) (90 )% $ 150,008 100 % Impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale 64,229 64,229 100 % Impairment of other intangible assets 4,578 (4,578 ) (100 )% 4,578 100 % Impairment of oil and gas related assets 205,897 21,537 41,017 184,360 856 % (19,480 ) (47 )% Other than temporary impairment on securities 54,314 54,314 100 % Total $ 339,129 $ 176,123 $ 41,017 $ 163,006 93 % $ 135,106 329 % During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized goodwill impairments of approximately $14.7 million and $150.0 million, respectively, related to our Canadian operations. During 2008, we 35 Table of Contents impaired the entire goodwill balance of $145.4 million of our Canada Well servicing and Drilling operating segment and recorded an impairment of $4.6 million to Nabors Blue Sky Ltd., one of our Canadian subsidiaries reported in our Other Operating segments. During 2009, we impaired the remaining goodwill balance of $14.7 million of Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. The impairment charges resulted from of our annual impairment tests on goodwill which compared the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of these business units was determined using discounted cash flow models involving assumptions based on our utilization of rigs or aircraft, revenues and earnings from affiliates, as well as direct costs, general and administrative costs, depreciation, applicable income taxes, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The impairment charges were deemed necessary due to the continued downturn in the oil and gas industry in Canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery in the value of these operations. This downturn has led to reduced capital spending by some of our customers and has diminished demand for our drilling services and for immediate access to remote drilling sites. A significantly prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the demand for and prices of our services, which could result in future goodwill impairment charges for other reporting units due to the potential impact on our estimate of our future operating results.
