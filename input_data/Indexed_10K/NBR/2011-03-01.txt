ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition. This information is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil and gas markets in the world. Our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of over 550 land drilling rigs, more than 700 rigs for land well servicing and workover work in the United States and Canada, offshore platform rigs, jack up units, barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles. We invest in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the United States, Canada and Colombia. The majority of our business is conducted through our various Contract Drilling operating segments, which include our drilling, well servicing and workover operations and pressure pumping, on land and offshore. Our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are included in our Oil and Gas operating segment. Our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in our Other Operating Segments. Our businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business. The primary determinant of customer spending is their cash flow and earnings, which (i) in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and Canadian Drilling operations are largely driven by natural gas prices and (ii) in our Alaskan, International, U.S. Offshore (Gulf of Mexico), Canadian Well servicing and U.S. Land Well servicing operations by oil prices. Both natural gas and oil prices impact our customers activity levels and spending for our Pressure Pumping operations. Oil and natural gas liquids prices are beginning to be more significant 30 Table of Contents factors in some of the traditionally natural gas driven operating segments. The following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per Bloomberg for the last three years: Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 to 2009 2009 to 2008 Commodity prices: Average Henry Hub natural gas spot price ($/thousand cubic feet (mcf)) $ 4.37 $ 3.94 $ 8.89 $ .43 11 % $ (4.95 ) (56 )% Average West Texas intermediate crude oil spot price ($/barrel) $ 79.51 $ 61.99 $ 99.92 $ 17.52 28 % $ (37.93 ) (38 )% Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, there was a significant reduction in the demand for natural gas and oil that was caused, at least in part, by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. Weaker demand throughout 2009 resulted in sustained lower natural gas and oil prices, which led to a sharp decline in the demand for drilling and workover services. During 2010, these commodity prices strengthened in the latter half of the year and demand for drilling activity improved. Continued fluctuations in the demand for gas and oil, among other factors including supply, could contribute to continued price volatility which may continue to affect demand for our services and could materially affect our future financial results. Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $4.2 billion, representing an increase of $679.9 million, or 19% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income (loss) attributable to Nabors for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $655.4 million and $94.7 million ($.33 per diluted share), respectively, representing increases of 55% and 211%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $3.5 billion, representing a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 34% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income (loss) attributable to Nabors for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $421.9 million and $(85.5) million ($(.30) per diluted share), respectively, representing decreases of 62% and 118%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2010, operating results improved as compared to 2009 primarily due to the incremental revenue and positive operating results from our Pressure Pumping operating segment and increased drilling activity in 2010 in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and Canada Well servicing operations relating to increased drilling activity in oil and the liquids oil shale plays. Our U.S. Well servicing business also improved with continuing strong crude oil prices, which have led to increased activity. However, our operating results and activity levels continued to be negatively impacted in our U.S. Offshore operations in response to uncertainty in the regulatory environment; our Alaskan operations due to key customers spending constraints; and elsewhere with less activity in Saudi Arabia and Mexico, two of our key markets. There was also improvement in our operating results for 2010 because there were no full cost ceiling adjustments recorded by our U.S. oil and gas joint venture. Our U.S. Offshore operations were improving during the first half of 2010 until the Gulf of Mexico explosion and oil spill occurred mid year, which resulted in temporary suspension of offshore drilling and further delays in our customers ability to obtain permits, which has limited the use of our assets. Specifically, operating results have been impacted because our customers have suspended most of their operations in the Gulf of Mexico, largely as a result of their inability to obtain government permits. Although the previously issued U.S. deepwater drilling moratorium has been lifted, it is uncertain whether our customers ability to obtain government permits will improve in the near term. Our Alaska operating segment has been negatively impacted because the largest operator in the area has curtailed and suspended drilling operations, creating a surplus of rigs in the market and causing price competition. We expect that these conditions will persist and continue to adversely impact our Alaska operating results through 2011. We expect our International results to remain flat in 2011 as the increase of land rig activity is expected to be essentially offset by contract renewals on our jack up rigs at significantly lower average dayrates. 31 Table of Contents During 2010, we recorded impairments and other charges of $260.9 million. We recognized goodwill and long lived asset impairments of approximately $10.7 million and $27.4 million, respectively, to assets in our U.S. Offshore operating segment, primarily driven by current market conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we recognized long lived asset impairments of $7.5 million to our aircraft and some drilling equipment in Canada and recorded impairments of $23.2 million relating to asset retirements across our U.S. Lower 48 Land, U.S. Well servicing and U.S. Offshore Contract Drilling segments. Our Oil and Gas operating segment recorded impairments of $54.3 million relating to an oil and gas financing receivable and $137.8 million under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for our wholly owned oil and gas related assets. During 2009 and 2008, our operating results were negatively impacted as a result of charges arising from oil and gas full cost ceiling test writedowns and other impairments. Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates includes $(189.3) million and $(207.3) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, representing our proportionate share of a full cost ceiling test writedown from our unconsolidated U.S. oil and gas joint venture which utilizes the full cost method of accounting. During 2009, our joint venture used a 12 month average price in the ceiling test calculation as required by the revised SEC rules whereas during 2008, the ceiling test calculation used the single day, year end commodity price that, at December 31, 2008, was near its low point for that year. The full cost ceiling test writedowns are included in our Oil and Gas operating segment results. During 2009, impairments and other charges of $331.0 million included recognition of other than temporary impairments of $54.3 million relating to our available for sale securities, and impairments of $64.2 million to long lived assets that were retired from our U.S. Offshore, Alaska, Canada and International contract drilling segments. We also recognized a goodwill impairment of $14.7 million relating to Nabors Blue Sky Ltd., one of our Canadian subsidiaries, which eliminated the remaining goodwill balance relating to remote aircraft operations in Canada. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $48.6 million to our wholly owned assets in our Oil and Gas operating segment under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for some of our oil and gas related assets and $149.1 million relating to an oil and gas financing receivable during the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2008, impairments and other charges of $176.1 million included goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $154.6 million recorded by our Canada Well servicing and Drilling operating segment and Nabors Blue Sky Ltd. We recognized these goodwill and intangible asset impairments to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. We consider these writedowns necessary because of the duration of the industry downturn in Canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery. We also recorded impairment charges of $21.5 million to our wholly owned assets in our Oil and Gas operating segment for some of our oil and gas related assets during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our operating results for 2011 are still expected to increase from levels realized during 2010, despite a moderating outlook of lower commodity prices during 2011 and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates. The major factors that support our expectations of an improved year are: An expected incremental increase from ancillary well site services, primarily technical pumping services and down hole surveying services, resulting from our acquisition in the third quarter of 2010, and The anticipated positive impact on our overall level of drilling and well servicing activity and margins resulting from our new and upgraded rigs added to our fleet over the past five years, which we expect will enhance our competitive position as market conditions improve. 32 Table of Contents The following
