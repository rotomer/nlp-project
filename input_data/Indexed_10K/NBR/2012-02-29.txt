ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Overview This section is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition. This information is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. Lower 48 states, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil and gas markets in the world. Our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of 499 land drilling rigs, 755 rigs for land well servicing and workover work in the United States and Canada, offshore platform rigs, jackup units, barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles. We have invested in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the United States, Canada and Colombia, but have announced our intention to dispose of a significant portion of our oil and gas portfolio in an expeditious and prudent manner. The majority of our business is conducted through our various Contract Drilling operating segments, which include our drilling, well servicing and workover operations, on land and offshore. Our hydraulic fracturing and downhole surveying services are included in our Pressure Pumping operating segment. Our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are included in our Oil and Gas operating segment, or in discontinued operations in some cases. Our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software, and construction operations are aggregated in our Other Operating Segments. Our businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business. Our customers spending is determined principally by their internally generated cash flow and to a lesser extent by joint venture arrangements and funding from the capital markets. In our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, Canadian Drilling and Pressure Pumping business units, operations have traditionally been driven by natural gas prices but the majority of current activity is being driven by the price of oil and natural gas liquids from unconventional reservoirs (shales). In our Alaskan, International, U.S. Offshore (Gulf of Mexico), Canadian Well servicing and U.S. Land Well servicing business units, operations are driven by oil prices. The following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per Bloomberg for the last three years: Year Ended December 31, Increase / (Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 to 2010 2010 to 2009 Commodity prices: Average Henry Hub natural gas spot price($/thousand cubic feet (mcf)) $ 4.00 $ 4.37 $ 3.94 $ (.37 ) (8 )% $ .43 11 % Average West Texas intermediate crude oil spot price ($/barrel) $ 95.05 $ 79.51 $ 61.99 $ 15.54 20 % $ 17.52 28 % Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, there was a significant reduction in the demand for natural gas and oil that was caused, at least in part, by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. Weaker demand throughout 2009 and into the first half of 2010 resulted in sustained lower natural gas and oil prices, which led to a sharp decline in the demand for drilling and workover services. During the latter half of 2010 and throughout 2011, commodity prices strengthened and demand for drilling activity improved. Continued fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and oil, among other factors including supply, could contribute to continued price volatility which may continue to affect demand for our services and could materially affect our future financial results. Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $6.1 billion, representing an increase of $1.9 billion, or 47% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $927.0 million and $342.2 million ($1.17 per diluted share), respectively, representing increases of 39% and 34%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating revenues and Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $4.2 billion, representing an increase of $661.0 million, or 19% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $667.5 million and $255.9 million ($.88 per diluted share), respectively, representing increases of 52% and 93%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2011, operating results improved as compared to 2010 primarily due to the incremental revenue and positive operating results from the addition of our Pressure Pumping operating segment beginning in September 2010, increased drilling activity in oil and liquids rich shale plays in our drilling operations in both our U.S. Lower 48 Land and Canada Drilling business units and increased well servicing activity in the U.S. and Canada. However, our operating results and activity levels continued to be negatively impacted in our U.S. Offshore operations in response to uncertainty in the regulatory environment in the Gulf of Mexico; our Alaskan operations due to key customers spending constraints; and in Saudi Arabia due to downtime and reduced rates on several jackup rigs. Our net income from continuing operations during 2011 was negatively impacted by $198.1 million in impairments and other charges, $100 million of which related to a provision for a contingent liability that existed on December 31, 2011 for a potential termination payment to our former Chief Executive Officer. See Note 3 for further discussion and subsequent developments. The remaining $98.1 million was comprised of a provision for retirement of long lived assets recorded by multiple operating segments. This related to the decommissioning and retirement of assets previously utilized in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling, International and U.S. Well servicing operations and the amounts are reflected in the Impairments and other charges line in our consolidated statements of income (loss). During 2010, operating results improved over 2009 primarily due to the incremental revenue and positive operating results from our Pressure Pumping operating segment and increased drilling activity in 2010 in our U.S. Lower 48 Land Drilling and Canada Well servicing operations relating to increased drilling activity in oil and the liquids oil shale plays. Our U.S. Well servicing business also improved with continuing strong crude oil prices, which led to increased activity. However, our operating results and activity levels were negatively impacted in our U.S. Offshore, Alaska and International operations. Our U.S. Offshore operations were improving during the first half of 2010 until the Gulf of Mexico explosion and oil spill occurred mid year, which resulted in temporary suspension of offshore drilling and further delays in our customers ability to obtain permits, which limited the use of our assets. Specifically, operating results were impacted because our customers suspended most of their operations in the Gulf of Mexico, largely as a result of their inability to obtain government permits. Our Alaska operating segment was negatively impacted because the largest operator in the area curtailed and suspended drilling operations, creating a surplus of rigs in the market and causing price competition. Our International results were flat as the increase of land rig activity was essentially offset by contract renewals on our jackup rigs at significantly lower average dayrates. Our net income from continuing operations during 2010 was negatively impacted by impairments and other charges of $61.3 million. We recognized goodwill impairment and recorded provisions for retirement of long lived assets of approximately $10.7 million and $27.4 million, respectively, to assets in our U.S. Offshore operating segment, primarily driven by current market conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we recorded impairments of $23.2 million relating to asset retirements across our U.S. Lower 48 Land, U.S. Well servicing and U.S. Offshore Contract Drilling segments. Discontinued operations include impairments of $54.3 million relating to an oil and gas financing receivable and $137.8 million under application of the successful efforts method of accounting for our wholly owned oil and gas related assets. Our net income from continuing operations during 2009 was negatively impacted by impairments and other charges of $118.5 million. The impairments and other charges included recognition of other than temporary impairments of $54.3 million relating to our available for sale securities, and a provision for retirement totaling 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $64.2 million to long lived assets from our U.S. Offshore, Alaska, Canada and International contract drilling segments. During 2011, we sold some of our wholly owned oil and gas assets in Colombia and received proceeds of $89.2 million. Additionally, Remora completed sales of its oil and gas assets in Colombia for gross proceeds of $333.1 million and has made cash distributions to us totaling $143.0 million during 2011 with a final distribution expected upon dissolution of the joint venture. We sold our working interest in properties located in California and received proceeds of $71.6 million. Our discontinued operations also include impairments of $255.0 million relating to oil and gas centered assets and $7.9 million relating to carrying value aircraft and other drilling equipment. We expect our operating results for 2012 to increase from levels realized during 2011, driven by the anticipated sustained higher oil prices and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates, along with the contributions from our Pressure Pumping operating segment. The key factors supporting our projections are: An increase in drilling in oil and liquids rich areas incremental to traditional dry gas regions by our U.S. Lower 48 Land and Canada Drilling and Well servicing operations; The extent of current term contracts in both our Lower 48 rig and pressure pumping segments, combined with new deployments in 2012, should serve to mitigate the impact of a potentially more rapid reduction in gas drilling activity arising from weaker natural gas pricing; Our expectation of a continued increase from ancillary well site services, primarily technical pumping services and down hole surveying services, resulting from our Pressure Pumping operating segment; and The anticipated positive impact on our overall level of drilling and well servicing activity and margins resulting from our new and upgraded rigs and equipment added to our fleet over the past five years, which we expect will enhance our competitive position as market conditions improve.
