ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2009. You should read the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes in conjunction with this discussion. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our 2009 financial and operating results include: operating revenues totaling $3.6 billion; net income of $1.7 billion or $6.42 per diluted share; net cash from operating activities totaling $2.1 billion; an increase in our average dayrate across our worldwide fleet to $197,143 from $174,506 in 2008; a decrease in debt to 10.0 percent of total capitalization at the end of 2009, down from 14.9 percent at the end of 2008. While the global macro environment improved during the second half of 2009, the worldwide economy remains uncertain. Oil prices remained steady during the third and fourth quarter in the $70 to $80 per barrel range; however, prices continue to be volatile. Various economic indicators also continue to be mixed, leading to broad concern about the length of the economic recovery. In spite of recent increases in oil prices, we have not seen a substantial increase in demand for offshore drilling services with relatively few new contract commitments signed regardless of water depth. We believe that demand remains strong in the deepwater market segment, but there is little new contract activity across the midwater or shallow water segments. In particular, dayrates for jackup units have decreased up to fifty percent in most regions and utilization has decreased. While we believe that the risk for early contract terminations or defaults under existing contracts has decreased over the course of the year, the risk has not been eliminated. If the global economy continues to improve and oil prices continue to stabilize in the current range, we may see increased demand for contract drilling services during 2010. However, due to the introduction of newbuild jackup units into the market, it is possible that dayrates for jackup units may not improve from current levels and could decline further as more units compete for available jobs. We cannot be certain of the future price of oil or the extent to which or when the global economy will recover. However, we believe that the current reduced demand for hydrocarbons is largely a result of the ongoing global financial uncertainty and that an economic recovery combined with the continued natural decline of worldwide hydrocarbon basins will be positive factors for the demand for future contract drilling services. We continue to believe we are well positioned within the industry. Furthermore, our liquidity and financial strength may create potential acquisition opportunities for us. Demand for our drilling services generally depends on a variety of economic and political factors, including worldwide demand for oil and gas, the ability of the OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing, the level of production of non OPEC countries and the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves. Our results of operations depend on activity in the oil and gas production and development markets worldwide. Historically, oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices have significantly affected that level of activity. Generally, higher oil and natural gas prices or our customers expectations of higher prices result in greater demand for our services and lower oil and gas prices result in reduced demand for our services. Demand for our services is also a function of the worldwide supply of mobile offshore drilling units. Industry sources report that a total of 58 newbuild jackups and 76 deepwater newbuilds are planned or under construction with scheduled delivery dates in 2010 and beyond. A significant number of these units, particularly among the jackup units, reportedly do not have a contractual commitment from a customer and are referred to in the offshore drilling industry as being built on speculation. The introduction of non contracted rigs into the marketplace could have an adverse affect on the level of demand for our services or the dayrates we are able to achieve. In addition, as a result of recent exploration discoveries offshore Brazil, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.(Petrobras), the Brazilian national oil company, has announced a plan to construct up to 28 deepwater rigs in Brazil. Petrobras has announced that they will finance and own the first nine of these additional rigs. Petrobras may seek long term contracts for the remaining 19 rigs to support construction and to allow drilling contractors to bid for the opportunity to supply up to four rigs per contractor. Currently there is not a deepwater drilling rig construction industry in Brazil. As a result, if new shipyards are built, construction prices for new rigs built in such shipyards could exceed the price of an equivalent rig built in an existing yard outside of Brazil. At current market dayrates, economic returns on these units may be challenged. We cannot predict how many contractors will participate in the bidding process or how many deepwater units may ultimately be constructed in Brazil. This potential increase in supply could also adversely impact overall industry dayrates and economics. We cannot predict the future level of demand for our drilling services or future conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry. Decreases in commodity prices or the level of demand for our drilling services or increases in the supply of drilling rigs in the market could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 27 Table of Contents Our long standing business strategy is the active expansion of our worldwide offshore drilling and deepwater capabilities through acquisitions, upgrades and modifications, and the deployment of drilling assets in important geological areas. We have also actively expanded our offshore drilling and deepwater capabilities in recent years through the construction of new rigs. In 2009, we continued our expansion strategy as indicated by the following developments and activities: we completed construction on the Noble Scott Marks, the last of three FG JU 2000E enhanced premium independent leg cantilevered jackups Noble has added to its fleet since 2007, that began operations in the third quarter of 2009 in the North Sea; we completed construction on the Noble Danny Adkins, an ultra deepwater semisubmersible, which left the shipyard during the fourth quarter of 2009 and commenced operating under a long term contract in the Gulf of Mexico; we continued construction on two additional newbuild ultra deepwater semisubmersibles, the Noble Dave Beard, which was completed and left the shipyard in the fourth quarter and is scheduled to commence drilling operations in the first quarter of 2010, and the Noble Jim Day, which is scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2010; and we commenced construction on one dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment Globetrotter class drillship, which is scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2011. Newbuild capital expenditures totaled $717 million during 2009. CONSUMMATION OF MIGRATION AND INTERNAL RESTRUCTURING On March 26, 2009, we completed a series of transactions that effectively changed the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland. As a result of these transactions, Noble Cayman, the previous publicly traded Cayman Islands parent holding company, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Swiss, the current parent Company. Noble Swiss principal asset is 100% of the shares of common stock of Noble Cayman. The consolidated financial statements of Noble Swiss include the accounts of Noble Cayman, and Noble Swiss conducts substantially all of its business through Noble Cayman and its subsidiaries. In connection with this transaction, we relocated our principal executive offices, executive officers and selected personnel to Geneva, Switzerland. On October 1, 2009, we completed a worldwide internal restructuring of the ownership of substantially all of our drilling rigs under a single non U.S. entity. The advantages of this restructuring include better alignment of fleet ownership and operation with our predominately non U.S. drilling business, facilitation of more efficient fleet deployment on a worldwide basis, and greater efficiency in managing cash and enhancing borrowing opportunities. Additionally, our effective tax rate has been beneficially impacted as a result of this restructuring. 28 Table of Contents CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES BACKLOG We maintain a backlog (as defined below) of commitments for contract drilling services. The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2009 the amount of our contract drilling services backlog and the percent of available operating days committed for the periods indicated: Year Ending December 31, Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2016 (In millions) Contract Drilling Services Backlog Semisubmersibles/Drillships (1) 7,115 $ 2,042 $ 1,609 $ 1,070 $ 1,020 $ 1,374 Jackups/Submersibles (2) 973 773 199 1 Total (3) (4) $ 8,088 $ 2,815 $ 1,808 $ 1,071 $ 1,020 $ 1,374 Percent of Available Operating Days Committed (5) 54 % 26 % 13 % 13 % 6 % (1) Our drilling contracts with Petrobras provide an opportunity for us to earn performance bonuses based on downtime experienced for our rigs operating offshore Brazil. With respect to our semisubmersibles operating offshore Brazil, we have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of potential performance bonuses for such semisubmersibles, which amount is based on and generally consistent with our historical earnings of performance bonuses for these rigs. With respect to our drillships operating offshore Brazil, we (a) have not included in our backlog any performance bonuses for periods prior to the commencement of certain upgrade projects planned for 2010 and 2011, which projects are designed to enhance the reliability and operational performance of our drillships, and (b) have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of potential performance bonuses for periods after the estimated completion of such upgrade projects. Our backlog for semisubmersibles/drillships includes approximately $299 million attributable to these performance bonuses. (2) Our drilling contracts with Pemex for certain jackups operating offshore in Mexico are subject to price review and adjustment of the rig dayrate. Presently, contracts for five jackups have dayrates indexed to the world average of the highest dayrates published by ODS Petrodata. After an initial firm dayrate period, the dayrates are generally adjusted quarterly based on formulas calculated from the index. Our contract drilling services backlog has been calculated using the December 31, 2009 index based dayrates for periods subsequent to the initial firm dayrate period. (3) Pemex has the ability to cancel its drilling contracts on 30 days or less notice without any early termination payment. We currently have 13 rigs contracted to Pemex in Mexico, and our backlog includes approximately $550 million related to such contracts at December 31, 2009. Also our drilling contracts generally give the customer an early termination right in the event we fail to meet certain performance standards, including downtime thresholds. While we do not currently anticipate any cancellations as a result of events that have occurred to date, clients may from time to time have the contractual right to do so, which is the case with the drilling contract for the Noble Roger Eason. However, based on communications to date with the customer we do not believe that the customer will terminate this contract. (4) The drilling contract for the Noble Jim Day contains a termination right in the event the rig is not ready to commence operations by December 31, 2010. The drilling contract for the Noble Dave Beard currently gives the customer the right to terminate the contract and also gives the customer the right to apply a penalty for delay beyond the August 2009 delivery date. (5) Percentages take into account additional capacity from the estimated dates of deployment of our newbuild rigs that are scheduled to commence operations during 2010 through 2011. Our contract drilling services backlog consists of commitments we believe to be firm. Our contract drilling services backlog reported above reflects estimated future revenues attributable to both signed drilling contracts and letters of intent. A letter of intent is generally subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive drilling contract. If worldwide economic conditions continue to deteriorate, it is possible that some customers that have entered into letters of intent will not enter into signed drilling contracts. We calculate backlog for any given unit and period by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate for such unit by the number of days remaining in the period. The reported contract drilling services backlog does not include amounts representing revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling services revenues, reimbursable amounts from customers or amounts attributable to uncommitted option periods under drilling contracts or letters of intent. 29 Table of Contents The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may differ from the backlog amounts and backlog periods set forth in the table above due to various factors, including, but not limited to, shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime, weather conditions and other factors that result in applicable dayrates lower than the full contractual operating dayrate. In addition, amounts included in the backlog may change because drilling contracts may be varied or modified by mutual consent or customers may exercise early termination rights or decline to enter into a drilling contract after executing a letter of intent. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for the future periods for which the backlog is calculated. INTERNAL INVESTIGATION Since June 2007, we have been conducting, with the assistance of independent outside counsel engaged by our audit committee, an internal investigation relating to our Nigerian operations. The investigation has focused on the legality under the FCPA, and local laws of our Nigerian affiliates reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by our customs agents in connection with obtaining and renewing permits for the temporary importation of drilling units and related equipment into Nigerian waters, including permits that are necessary for our drilling units to operate in Nigerian waters. The scope of the investigation has also included our dealings with customs agents and customs authorities in certain parts of the world other than Nigeria in which we conduct our operations, as well as dealings with other types of local agents in Nigeria and such other parts of the world. There can be no assurance that evidence of additional potential FCPA violations or violations of other laws or regulations may not be uncovered through the investigation. We voluntarily contacted the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to advise them of the independent investigation. We have been cooperating, and intend to continue to cooperate fully with both agencies. If the SEC or the DOJ determines that violations of the FCPA have occurred, they could seek civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, against us and or certain of our employees, as well as additional changes to our business practices and compliance programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. In addition, such actions, whether actual or alleged, could damage our reputation and ability to do business, to attract and retain employees, and to access capital markets. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving such actions is expensive and consumes significant time and attention of our senior management. The independent outside counsel appointed by the audit committee to perform the internal investigation made a presentation of the results of its investigation to the DOJ and the SEC in June 2008. Since June 2008, the SEC and the DOJ have reviewed these results and information gathered by the independent outside counsel in the course of the investigation. We consider the matter to be ongoing and cannot predict (a) when it will conclude, (b) whether either the SEC or the DOJ will open its own proceeding to investigate this matter, or (c) if a proceeding is opened, what potential sanctions, penalties or other remedies these agencies may seek. We could also face fines or sanctions in relevant foreign jurisdictions. Based on information obtained to date, we believe it is probable that we will have to pay an amount to settle this matter with the DOJ and SEC, however, we are not in a position to estimate any potential liability that may result and, as a result, we have not made any accrual in our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2009. Notwithstanding that the investigation is ongoing, we concluded that certain changes to our FCPA compliance program would provide us greater assurance that our assets are not used, directly or indirectly, to make improper payments, including customs payments, and that we are in compliance with the FCPAs record keeping requirements. Although we have had a long standing published policy requiring compliance with the FCPA and broadly prohibiting any improper payments by us to foreign or U.S. officials, we adopted additional measures intended to enhance FCPA compliance procedures. Further measures may be required once the investigation matter is concluded. We are currently operating three jackup rigs offshore Nigeria. The temporary import permits covering two of these rigs expired in November 2008 and we have pending applications to renew these permits. However, as of February 15, 2010, the Nigerian customs office had not acted on our applications. We have obtained a temporary import permit for the third rig, which was recently imported into the country. We continue to seek to avoid material disruption to our Nigerian operations; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new permits or further extensions of permits necessary to continue the operation of our rigs in Nigeria. If we cannot obtain a new permit or an extension necessary to continue operations of any rig, we may need to cease operations under the drilling contract for such rig and relocate such rig from Nigerian waters. In any case, we also could be subject to actions by Nigerian customs for import duties and fines for these two rigs, as well as other drilling rigs that operated in Nigeria in the past. We cannot predict what impact these events may have on any such contract or our business in Nigeria. Furthermore, we cannot predict what changes, if any, relating to temporary import permit policies and procedures may be established or implemented in Nigeria in the future, or how any such changes may impact our business there. 30 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 Compared to 2008 General Net income for 2009 was $1.7 billion, or $6.42 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.6 billion, compared to net income for 2008 of $1.6 billion, or $5.81 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.4 billion. Rig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates Operating revenues and operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2009 and 2008: Average Rig Operating Average Utilization (1) Days (2) Dayrates 2009 2008 2009 2008 % Change 2009 2008 % Change Jackups 82 % 92 % 12,719 13,879 8 % $ 147,701 $ 148,532 1 % Semisubmersibles 6000 (3) 98 % 96 % 2,578 2,466 5 % 417,177 327,558 27 % Semisubmersibles 6000 (4) 100 % 100 % 1,095 1,098 0 % 253,557 220,475 15 % Drillships 91 % 67 % 993 732 36 % 254,084 201,819 26 % Submersibles (5) 51 % 66 % 418 729 43 % 61,711 54,106 14 % Total 84 % 90 % 17,803 18,904 6 % $ 197,143 $ 174,506 13 % (1) Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of actively marketed rigs in our fleet excluding newbuild rigs under construction. (2) Information reflects the number of days that our rigs were operating under contract. (3) These units have water depth ratings of 6,000 feet or greater. (4) These units have water depth ratings of less than 6,000 feet. (5) Effective March 31, 2009, the Noble Fri Rodli, which had been cold stacked since October 2007, was removed from our rig fleet. 31 Table of Contents Contract Drilling Services The following table sets forth the operating revenues and the operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment for 2009 and 2008: Change 2009 2008 $ % Operating revenues: Contract drilling services $ 3,509,755 $ 3,298,850 $ 210,905 6 % Reimbursables (1) 96,161 76,099 20,062 26 % Other 1,302 1,275 27 2 % $ 3,607,218 $ 3,376,224 $ 230,994 7 % Operating costs and expenses: Contract drilling services $ 1,006,764 $ 1,011,882 $ (5,118 ) 1 % Reimbursables (1) 82,122 65,251 16,871 26 % Depreciation and amortization 398,572 349,448 49,124 14 % Selling, general and administrative 80,004 72,381 7,623 11 % (Gain)/Loss on asset disposal/involuntary conversion, net 31,053 10,000 21,053 ** 1,598,515 1,508,962 89,553 6 % Operating income $ 2,008,703 $ 1,867,262 $ 141,441 8 % (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues and the related direct costs as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues. Contract drilling services revenue increases for 2009 as compared to 2008 were primarily driven by increases in average dayrates. Average dayrates increased revenues approximately $428 million for 2009, while fewer operating days reduced revenues approximately $217 million. Average dayrates increased 13 percent in 2009 as compared to 2008. Except for our jackup rigs, which were impacted by the weakening demand in the shallow waters worldwide, higher average dayrates were received across all other rig categories as scheduled contractual increases for deepwater rigs, coupled with the completion of additional deepwater rigs, drove average dayrates higher in those classes. The decrease in operating days in 2009 as compared 2008 was primarily due to downtime of certain rigs in 2009. Unpaid shipyard days increased 498 days in 2009 as compared to 2008, as we had 21 rigs spend time in the shipyard during 2009. We had only 12 rigs with unpaid shipyard days in 2008. Additionally, stacked days increased 850 days as the Noble Al White, Noble Byron Welliver, Noble Cees van Diemen, Noble Dick Favor, Noble Don Walker, Noble Fri Rodli, Noble Joe Alford, Noble Lester Pettus, Noble Lloyd Noble and Noble Tommy Craighead each were stacked for certain periods during 2009. In 2008, five rigs, the Noble Carl Norberg, Noble Don Walker, Noble Fri Rodli, Noble Joe Alford, and the Noble Roy Butler, spent a significant number of days stacked. The decrease in operating days in 2009 was partially offset by a 576 day increase in available days for the enhanced premium jackups Noble Hans Deul and Noble Scott Marks, which were placed into service in November 2008 and June 2009, respectively, and the addition of the semisubmersible Noble Danny Adkins, which began operating under contract in October 2009. We also had 275 less available days in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the Noble Fri Rodli being removed from our rig fleet effective March 31, 2009. Additionally, 2009 had one less available operating day than 2008 due to the leap year, which reduced available days in 2009 by 54 days. 32 Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses decreased $5 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. Our newbuild rigs, the Noble Hans Deul, Noble Scott Marks, and the Noble Danny Adkins, which were placed into service in November 2008, June 2009, and October 2009, respectively, added approximately $34 million of operating costs in 2009. Excluding the additional expenses related to our newbuild rigs, our contract drilling costs decreased $39 million in 2009 versus 2008. This change was primarily driven by a $42 million decrease in local labor costs due to the increased number of rigs stacked during 2009 and an $18 million decrease in insurance costs from our insurance program under which we are predominately self insured. These decreases were partially offset by a $9 million increase in miscellaneous transportation and fuel costs, a $9 million increase in mobilization costs and a $3 million increase in other operating cost and expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased $49 million in 2009 over 2008 due to depreciation on newbuilds placed into service, and additional depreciation related to other capital expenditures on our fleet since the beginning of 2008. Since the beginning of 2008, we have spent $2.6 billion on contract drilling capital expenditures. Loss on asset disposal/involuntary conversion in 2009 primarily consists of a charge of $17 million for our jackup, the Noble David Tinsley, which experienced a punch through while being positioned on location offshore Qatar. The $17 million charge includes approximately $9 million for the write off of the damaged legs and $8 million for non reimbursable expenses. Also during 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $12 million for the Noble Fri Rodli as a result of a decision to evaluate disposition alternatives for this submersible drilling unit. Other The following table sets forth the operating revenues and the operating costs and expenses for our other services for 2009 and 2008 (in thousands): Change 2009 2008 $ % Operating revenues: Labor contract drilling services $ 30,298 $ 55,078 $ (24,780 ) 45 % Reimbursables (1) 3,040 14,750 (11,710 ) 79 % Other 228 449 (221 ) 49 % $ 33,566 $ 70,277 $ (36,711 ) 52 % Operating costs and expenses: Labor contract drilling services $ 18,827 $ 42,573 $ (23,746 ) 56 % Reimbursables (1) 2,913 14,076 (11,163 ) 79 % Depreciation and amortization 9,741 7,210 2,531 35 % Selling, general and administrative 258 1,762 (1,504 ) 85 % (Gain)/Loss on asset disposal, net (214 ) (36,485 ) 36,271 ** 31,525 29,136 2,389 8 % Operating income $ 2,041 $ 41,141 $ (39,100 ) 95 % (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The reduction in reimbursables for 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business in 2008. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues. Our labor contract drilling services revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business in April 2008. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2008, we returned the jackup Noble Kolskaya, which we had operated under a bareboat charter, to its owner. Revenues during 2008 related to our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and the Noble Kolskaya were $22 million in 2008. The remaining variance is due to currency exchange fluctuations and decreases related to revenue from the platform that we operate in Canada. Operating Costs and Expenses. Labor contract drilling services costs and expenses decreased $24 million due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and the return of the Noble Kolskaya to its owner in 2008. Expenses during 2008 related to our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and Noble Kolskaya were $19 million. Operating costs associated with our Canadian labor contracts in 2009 decreased $5 million from 2008 primarily as a result of decreases in operations under the Hibernia contract and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 33 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to $7 million in costs related to our re domestication from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland, a $6 million increase in salaries and employment related costs, $4 million in charges related to our worldwide internal restructuring, and a $3 million increase due to our Restoration Plan mark to market adjustment, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in costs incurred in the internal investigation of our Nigerian operations, and a $2 million decrease in other selling general and administrative expenses. Interest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized decreased $3 million primarily due to repayments of debt not subject to interest capitalization coupled with higher capital expenditures, and capitalized interest, in 2009 as compared to 2008. Capitalized interest was $55 million for 2009 versus $48 million for 2008. Income Tax Provision. The income tax provision decreased $14 million primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008. The lower effective tax rate of 16.7 percent in 2009 compared to 18.4 percent in 2008 decreased income tax expense by approximately $34 million. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 resulted primarily from the worldwide internal restructuring that took place in October 2009 and from higher pre tax earnings of non U.S. owned assets, which generally have a lower statutory tax rate. This decrease was partially offset by increased pre tax earnings of approximately $103 million 2008 Compared to 2007 General Net income for 2008 was $1.6 billion, or $5.81 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.4 billion, compared to net income for 2007 of $1.2 billion, or $4.45 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.0 billion.

Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage Operating Revenues. Contract drilling services revenue increases for 2008 as compared to 2007 were primarily driven by increases in average dayrates. Average dayrates increased revenues approximately $670 million for 2008, while fewer operating days reduced revenues approximately $86 million. Average dayrates increased 25 percent in 2008 as compared to 2007. Except for our submersible rigs, which were impacted by weakening demand in the shallow waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, higher average dayrates were received across all rig categories as strong demand for drilling rigs drove market dayrates higher. Demand in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico has been weakened due to decreases in natural gas prices and increases in operating costs compared to on shore drilling. The decrease in operating days in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in downtime of certain rigs in 2008. Unpaid shipyard days increased 417 days in 2008 as compared to 2007, as the Noble Roy Butler and the Noble George McLeod each spent significant time in the shipyard during 2008 for rig modifications and regulatory inspections, and the Noble Roger Eason was completing repairs for fire damage suffered in November 2007. Additionally, the Noble Fri Rodli, the Noble Don Walker, the Noble Roy Butler and the Noble Carl Norberg spent an aggregate total of 852 days stacked during 2008. The Noble Fri Rodli has been cold stacked since October 2007 due to weakening demand in the shallow waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Noble Don Walker, the Noble Roy Butler and the Noble Carl Norberg spent time stacked in 2008 due to weakness in the Nigerian market. The Noble Carl Norberg and the Noble Roy Butler are currently under contract in Mexico, and the Noble Don Walker was operating under a contract off the West African coast of Benin. The aggregate number of stacked days in 2007 was 255 days. These decreases in operating days were partially offset by increased operating days of 471 days for three recently completed newbuilds, the ultra deepwater semisubmersible the Noble Clyde Boudreaux and the enhanced premium jackups the Noble Roger Lewis and the Noble Hans Deul, which were added to the fleet in June 2007, September 2007 and November 2008, respectively. Additionally, 2008 had one more available operating day than 2007 due to leap year, which added 54 more operating days in 2008. 35 Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services expenses increased 15 percent in 2008 as compared to 2007. Our newbuild rigs, including the Noble Clyde Boudreaux, the Noble Roger Lewis and the Noble Hans Deul, added $45 million of operating costs in 2008 as compared to 2007. Excluding the effect of these rigs, our labor costs increased $42 million in 2008 over 2007 due to higher compensation, including retention programs designed to retain key rig and operations personnel. The remaining $45 million of the operating cost increase in 2008 over 2007 was primarily due to increases in costs of daily rig operations, including a $19 million increase in maintenance expenses, an $11 million increase in crew rotation and transportation costs and to a lesser extent, increases in catering, fuel, rig communications and safety and training costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $66 million in 2008 over 2007 due to depreciation on newbuilds added to the fleet, and additional depreciation related to other capital expenditures on our fleet since the beginning of 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $11 million in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a $6 million decrease in severance costs related to executive departures, a $3 million reduction in compensation expense on our Restoration Plan mark to market adjustment and a $2 million decrease in costs incurred in the internal investigation of our Nigerian operations. Hurricane losses and recoveries, net for 2008 relate to a charge of $10 million, which represents our deductible under our insurance program, for certain of our rigs operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Ike. All damaged rigs have subsequently returned to work. During 2007, we recognized a net recovery of $4 million on the final settlement of all remaining physical damage and loss of hire insurance claims for damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Other The following table sets forth the operating revenues and the operating costs and expenses for our other services for 2008 and 2007: Change 2008 2007 $ % Operating revenues: Labor contract drilling services $ 55,078 $ 156,508 $ (101,430 ) 65 % Reimbursables (1) 14,750 37,297 (22,547 ) 60 % Other 449 1,986 (1,537 ) 77 % $ 70,277 $ 195,791 $ (125,514 ) 64 % Operating costs and expenses: Labor contract drilling services $ 42,573 $ 125,624 $ (83,051 ) 66 % Reimbursables (1) 14,076 34,988 (20,912 ) 60 % Engineering, consulting and other 17,520 (17,520 ) 100 % Depreciation and amortization 7,210 9,762 (2,552 ) 26 % Selling, general and administrative 1,762 2,136 (374 ) 18 % (Gain)/Loss on asset disposal, net (36,485 ) (36,485 ) ** 29,136 190,030 (160,894 ) 85 % Operating income $ 41,141 $ 5,761 $ 35,380 614 % (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage 36 Table of Contents Operating Revenues. Our labor contract drilling services revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business in April 2008. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2008, we returned the jackup Noble Kolskaya, which we had operated under a bareboat charter, to its owner. Revenues during 2008 related to our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and the Noble Kolskaya were $22 million as compared to $124 million in 2007. Engineering, consulting and other operating revenues decreased $2 million in 2008 from 2007 due to closure of the operations of our Triton Engineering Services, Inc. (Triton) subsidiary in March 2007 and the sale of the rotary steerable assets and intellectual property of our Noble Downhole Technology Ltd. (Downhole Technology) subsidiary in November 2007. We no longer conduct engineering and consulting operations. Operating Costs and Expenses. Labor contract drilling services costs and expenses decreased in 2008 due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and the return of the Noble Kolskaya to its owner. Engineering, consulting and other expenses decreased $17 million in 2008 due to the sale of the Downhole Technology assets and the closure of the operations of Triton. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the return of the Noble Kolskaya to its owner during 2008. Other Income and Expenses Interest Expense. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, decreased $9 million due to lower average debt levels in 2008 than 2007 primarily as a result of short term borrowings during 2007 that contributed $8 million in interest expense. The short term borrowings were used to repay an inter company loan in connection with the dissolution of a wholly owned subsidiary. Capitalized interest for 2008 was $48 million as compared to $50 million for 2007. Interest income and other, net. Interest income decreased $3 million in 2008 from 2007 primarily as a result of the investment of the proceeds from the short term borrowings described above during 2007 that contributed $6 million in interest income during 2007. This decrease was partially offset by interest on increased average cash and cash equivalent balances during 2008. Income Tax Provision. The income tax provision increased $69 million primarily due to higher pre tax earnings in 2008 over 2007. The higher pre tax earnings increased income tax expense by approximately $81 million, offset by a lower effective tax rate of 18.4 percent in 2008 compared to 19.0 percent in 2007, that decreased income tax expense by approximately $12 million. The lower effective tax rate in 2008 resulted primarily from higher pre tax earnings of non U.S. owned assets, which generally have a lower statutory tax rate. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our principal capital resource in 2009 was net cash from operating activities of $2.1 billion, which compared to $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in net cash from operating activities in 2009 was primarily attributable to higher net income. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $735 million and $600 million available under our bank credit facility. We had working capital of $1.0 billion and $561 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of total debt plus shareholders equity was 10.0 percent and 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result of the cash generated by our operations, our cash on hand and the availability under our bank credit facility, we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs for 2010 including: normal recurring operating expenses; capital expenditures, including expenditures for newbuilds; repurchase of registered shares, and payments of return on capital in the form of a reduction of par value of our registered shares (in lieu of dividends); and contributions to our pension plans. 37 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Our primary liquidity requirement in 2010 will be for capital expenditures. We had total capital expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2009, and $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion for 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2009, we had two rigs under construction, and capital expenditures for new construction, including capitalized interest totaled $717 million in 2009. Capital expenditures for newbuild rigs in 2009 included $172 million for the Noble Jim Day, $167 million for the Noble Dave Beard, $163 million for the Noble Danny Adkins and $162 million for our Globetrotter class drillship. Additionally, new construction capital expenditures for 2009 included $53 million for our remaining newbuilds, which include the recently completed Noble Scott Marks and the Noble Hans Deul. Other capital expenditures totaled $595 million in 2009, which included approximately $406 million for major upgrade projects, including $167 million to upgrade of our three drillships in Brazil. Capitalized major maintenance expenditures, which typically occur every 3 to 5 years, totaled $119 million in 2009. Our total capital expenditures budget for 2010 is approximately $1.0 billion. In connection with our 2010 and future capital expenditure programs, we have entered into certain commitments, including shipyard and purchase commitments, for approximately $1.1 billion, of which we expect to spend approximately $700 million in 2010. Our remaining 2010 capital expenditure budget will generally be spent at our discretion. We may accelerate or delay capital projects, as needed. From time to time we consider possible projects that would require capital expenditures or other cash expenditures that are not included in our capital budget, and such unbudgeted capital or cash expenditures could be significant. In addition, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of drilling units from time to time. Other factors that could cause actual capital expenditures to materially exceed planned capital expenditures include delays and cost overruns in shipyards (including costs attributable to labor shortages), shortages of equipment, latent damage or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions, and changes in design criteria or specifications during repair or construction. Share Repurchase, Distributions of Capital and Dividends Our Board of Directors has authorized and adopted a share repurchase program. At December 31, 2009, 12.9 million shares remained available under this authorization. Future repurchases will be subject to the requirements of Swiss law, including the requirement that we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if and to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves are available. Also, the aggregate par value of all registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries, including treasury shares, may not exceed 10 percent of our registered share capital without shareholder approval. Our existing share repurchase program received the required shareholder approval prior to completion of our 2009 Swiss migration transaction. Share repurchases for each of the three years ended December 31, 2009 were as follows: Total Number Average Year Ended of Shares Total Cost Price Paid December 31, Purchased (in thousands) per share 2009 5,470,000 (1) $ 186,506 $ 34.10 2008 7,965,109 331,514 41.62 2007 4,219,000 178,494 42.31 (1) Repurchases made subsequent to March 26, 2009, which totaled 3,750,000 shares are being held as treasury shares at December 31, 2009 Our most recent quarterly payment to shareholders, in the form of a capital reduction, which was declared on February 8, 2010 and is to be paid on February 26, 2010 to holders of record on February 18, 2010, was 0.05 CHF per share, or an aggregate of approximately $12 million. The declaration and payment of dividends in the future by Noble Swiss and the making of distributions of capital, including returns of capital in the form of par value reductions, require authorization of the shareholders of Noble Swiss. The amount of such dividends, distributions and returns of capital will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors and shareholders. 38 Table of Contents Recently, our Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholder authorization at our upcoming annual general meeting scheduled for April 30, 2010, the payment of a regular return of capital through a reduction of the par value of our shares in a total amount equal to Swiss francs 0.52 CHF per share to be paid in four equal installments scheduled for August 2010, November 2010, February 2011 and May 2011. In addition, our Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholder authorization at our upcoming annual general meeting, a single payment of a special return of capital through a par value reduction of 0.56 CHF per share. This payment will be paid together with the regular return of capital in August 2010. The payments will be made in U.S. dollars based on the CHF/USD exchange rate available approximately two business days prior to the payment date. Although the amount of the return of capital, expressed in Swiss francs, is fixed, the amount of the payment in U.S. dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate. The exchange rate as published by the Swiss National Bank on February 5, 2010 was 1.0742 CHF/1.0 USD. If approved by our shareholders, these returns of capital will require us to make total cash payments of approximately $200 million in 2010 (based on the exchange rate on February 5, 2010). Contributions to Pension Plans In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law in the U.S. The PPA requires that pension plans fund towards a target of at least 100 percent with a transition through 2011 and increases the amount we are allowed to contribute to our U.S. pension plans in the near term. During 2009, 2008 and 2007 we made contributions to our non U.S. and U.S. pension plans totaling $18 million, $21 million and $54 million, respectively. We expect the minimum aggregate contributions to our non U.S. and U.S. plans in 2010, subject to applicable law, to be $14 million. We continue to monitor and evaluate funding options based upon market conditions and may increase contributions at our discretion. Credit Facility and Long Term Debt We have a $600 million unsecured bank credit facility (the Credit Facility), which was originally scheduled to mature on March 15, 2012. During the first quarter of 2008, the term of the Credit Facility was extended for an additional one year period to March 15, 2013. During this one year extension period, the total amount available under the Credit Facility will be $575 million, but we have the right to seek an increase of the total amount available during that period to $600 million. We may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the Credit Facility be further extended for an additional one year period. Our subsidiary, Noble Drilling Corporation (Noble Drilling), has guaranteed the obligations under the Credit Facility. In connection with the worldwide restructuring completed during 2009 (see Part II Item 8 Note 1), our subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited, issued a subsidiary guarantee under the Credit Facility effective October 1, 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect to increase the amount available up to $800 million. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest (i) at the sum of Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Facility; 0.235 percent based on our current credit ratings), or (ii) at the base rate, determined as the greater of the prime rate for U.S. Dollar loans announced by Citibank, N.A. in New York or the sum of the weighted average overnight federal funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50 percent. The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including a debt to total tangible capitalization covenant that limits this ratio to 0.60. As of December 31, 2009, our debt to total tangible capitalization was 0.10. In addition, the Credit Facility includes restrictions on certain fundamental changes such as mergers, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the Credit Facility, and the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets unless to a subsidiary. The Credit Facility also limits our subsidiaries additional indebtedness, excluding intercompany advances and loans, to 10 percent of our consolidated net assets, as defined in the Credit Facility, unless a subsidiary guarantee is issued to the parent company borrower. There are also restrictions on our incurring or assuming additional liens in certain circumstances. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2009. We continually monitor compliance under our Credit Facility covenants and, based on our expectations for 2010, expect to remain in compliance during the year. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $150 million in letters of credit. While the issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding, it does reduce the amount available. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowing or letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our lenders under the Credit Facility, and we believe that our lenders have the liquidity and capability to perform should the need arise for us to draw on the Credit Facility. 39 Table of Contents In November 2008, we issued through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited, $250 million principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2014. Proceeds, net of discount and issuance costs, totaled $247 million. Interest on the 7.375% Senior Notes is payable semi annually, in arrears, on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes contain covenants that place restrictions on certain merger and consolidation transactions, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the indenture, and on the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, there are restrictions on incurring or assuming certain liens and sale and lease back transactions. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all our debt covenants. We continually monitor compliance with the covenants under our notes and, based on our expectations for 2010, expect to remain in compliance during the year. At December 31, 2009, we had letters of credit of $96 million and performance and tax assessment bonds totaling $299 million supported by surety bonds outstanding. Of the letters of credit outstanding, $54 million were issued to support bank bonds in connection with our drilling units in Nigeria. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries issue, from time to time, guarantees of the temporary import status of rigs or equipment imported into certain countries in which we operate. These guarantees are issued in lieu of payment of custom, value added or similar taxes in those countries. During the first quarter of 2009, we repaid $150 million principal amount of 6.95% Senior Notes due 2009 and $23 million principal amount of project financing Thompson Notes using cash on hand at maturity. Our debt decreased to $751 million at December 31, 2009 from $923 million (including current maturities of $173 million) at December 31, 2008, primarily due to the retirement of $150 million in 6.95% Senior Notes and the repayment of the remaining $23 million of project financing of the Noble Jim Thomson, mentioned above. Other than our outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds discussed above, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no other off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet arrangements. For additional information on our long term debt, see Note 6 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Summary of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Other Contractual Cash Obligations Long term debt obligations $ 750,946 $ $ $ $ 299,874 $ 249,377 $ 201,695 $ Interest payments 288,365 51,190 51,190 51,190 42,377 24,346 68,072 Operating leases 18,003 7,715 3,877 766 367 367 4,911 Pension plan contributions (1) 23,148 13,530 1,060 404 654 553 6,947 Purchase commitments (2) 1,099,573 696,413 353,262 49,898 Tax reserves (3) 105,245 105,245 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,285,280 $ 768,848 $ 409,389 $ 102,258 $ 343,272 $ 274,643 $ 281,625 $ 105,245 (1) Pension plan contributions are estimated by third party actuaries for defined benefit plan funding in 2009 and estimated future benefit payments beginning in 2010 for the unfunded nonqualified excess benefit plan. Estimates of minimum funding for our qualified benefit plan beyond the 2009 plan year are not available. (2) Purchase commitments consist of obligations outstanding to external vendors primarily related to future capital purchases. (3) Tax reserves are included in Other due to the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements to taxing authorities. See Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. 40 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, we had other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash if the obligations are called. These obligations include letters of credit and surety bonds that guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts, insurance, tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions. These letters of credit and surety bond obligations are not normally called as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Contractual Cash Obligations Letters of Credit $ 96,020 $ 43,201 $ 52,819 $ $ $ $ Surety bonds 299,461 171,786 108,433 19,242 Total commercial commitments $ 395,481 $ 214,987 $ 161,252 $ 19,242 $ $ $ CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. Critical accounting policies and estimates that most significantly impact our consolidated financial statements are described below. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying value may not be recoverable. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. Drilling equipment and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as of the date placed in service or date of major refurbishment. Estimated useful lives of our drilling equipment range from three to thirty years. Other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to twenty five years. Interest is capitalized on construction in progress at the interest rate on debt incurred for construction or at the weighted average cost of debt outstanding during the period of construction. Overhauls and scheduled maintenance of equipment are performed based on the number of hours operated in accordance with our preventative maintenance program. Routine repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred; however, the costs of the overhauls and scheduled major maintenance projects that benefit future periods and which typically occur every three to five years are deferred when incurred and amortized over an equivalent period. The deferred portion of these major maintenance projects is included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Assets We evaluate the realization of our long lived assets, including property and equipment and goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We evaluated goodwill on at least an annual basis. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the assets carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value. An impairment loss on our goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, as determined pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards. During 2009, we recorded a $12 million impairment charge on long lived assets in conjunction with our decision to explore disposal options for the submersible rig Noble Fri Rodli. No impairment losses were recorded on our property and equipment balances during the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2007, we recorded impairments to goodwill of $10 million in conjunction with our planned rationalization of our technology services division. All of our goodwill was attributable to our engineering and consulting services, and we had no goodwill recorded as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. Insurance Reserves We maintain various levels of self insured retention for certain losses including property damage, loss of hire, employment practices liability, employers liability, and general liability, among others. We accrue for property damage and loss of hire charges on a per event basis. 41 Table of Contents Employment practices liability claims are accrued based on actual claims during the year. Maritime employers liability claims are generally estimated using actuarial determinations. General liability claims are estimated by our internal claims department by evaluating the facts and circumstances of each claim (including incurred but not reported claims) and making estimates based upon historical experience with similar claims. At December 31, 2009, loss reserves for personal injury and protection claims totaled $23 million and are included in Other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and other employee benefit plans Our defined benefit pension and other employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with updated FASB standards. Pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including, but not limited to, expected return on plan assets, discount rates, compensation increases and employee turnover rates. We evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary. Significant changes to the broader economic market can materially impact the assumptions, and contributions for any given period. Revenue Recognition Revenues generated from our dayrate basis drilling contracts and labor contracts are recognized as services are performed. We may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment and personnel. Mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a drilling unit from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract. Costs incurred to relocate drilling units to more promising geographic areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. Lump sum payments received from customers relating to specific contracts, including equipment modifications, are deferred and amortized to income over the term of the drilling contract. Deferred revenues under drilling contracts totaled $32 million and $8 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and such amounts are included in either Other current liabilities or Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition. We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses. Reimbursements for loss of hire under our insurance coverages are included in (Gain)/loss on assets disposal/involuntary conversion, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided based on the laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted or in which we or our subsidiaries are considered resident for income tax purposes. Applicable income and withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries. We do not intend to repatriate such undistributed earnings for the foreseeable future except for distributions upon which incremental income and withholding taxes would not be material. In certain circumstances, we expect that, due to changing demands of the offshore drilling markets and the ability to redeploy our offshore drilling units, certain of such units will not reside in a location long enough to give rise to future tax consequences. As a result, no deferred tax liability or asset has been recognized in these circumstances. Should our expectations change regarding the length of time an offshore drilling unit will be used in a given location, we will adjust deferred taxes accordingly. Our recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability in these circumstances would not have had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation pursuant to current accounting standards. Accordingly, we record the grant date fair value of share based compensation arrangements as compensation cost using a straight line method over the service period. Share based compensation is expensed or capitalized based on the nature of the employees activities. 42 Table of Contents Inherent in expensing stock options and other share based compensation under accounting standards are several judgments and estimates that must be made. These include determining the underlying valuation methodology for share compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation, such as our expected stock price volatility, expected term of the employee option, expected dividend yield, the expected risk free interest rate, the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option. Changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards. For option valuations, we utilize the Black Scholes option pricing model, however, we also use lattice models to verify that the assumptions used are reasonable. We utilize the Monte Carlo Simulation Model for valuing the performance vested restricted stock awards. Additionally, for such awards, similar assumptions were made for each of the companies included in the defined index and the peer group of companies in order to simulate the future outcome using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model. New Accounting Pronouncements In April 2009, the FASB issued the following guidance: expanded disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods. This guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and has applied to our disclosures beginning with our second fiscal quarter of 2009. additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. This guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and has applied to our disclosures beginning with our second fiscal quarter of 2009. amendment to the guidance in other than temporary impairment for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. This guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and has applied to our disclosures beginning with our second fiscal quarter of 2009. The adoption of the above guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance which expands disclosures of subsequent events and requires management to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. This guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 and has applied to our disclosures beginning with our second fiscal quarter of 2009. Our adoption of this guidance had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance which expanded disclosures that a reporting entity provides about transfers of financial assets and its effect on the financial statements. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation. Also in June 2009, the FASB issued guidance which revises how an entity evaluates variable interest entities. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation. In addition, in June 2009, the FASB modified the GAAP hierarchy and how authoritative guidance is referenced in financial statements. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of guidance did not have a material impact on the disclosures of our financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance which impacts the recognition of revenue in multi deliverable arrangements. The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The goal of this guidance is to clarify disclosures related to multi deliverable arrangements and to align the accounting with the underlying economics of the multi deliverable transaction. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance but do not believe this guidance will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates or equity prices, as further described below. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is at an agreed upon percentage point spread over LIBOR, or a base rate stated in the agreement. At December 31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. Foreign Currency Risk As a multinational company, we conduct business in approximately 15 countries. Our functional currency is primarily the U.S. dollar, which is consistent with the oil and gas industry. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the currencies of the countries in which we operate, the U.S. dollar reported expenses will increase (decrease). We are exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that local currency expenses exceed revenues denominated in local currency that are other than the functional currency. To help combat this potential risk we periodically enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and we may conduct hedging activities in future periods to mitigate such exposure. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Amounts recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedged item is recorded directly to earnings. We have documented policies and procedures to monitor and control the use of derivative instruments. We do not engage in derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives. Our North Sea operations have a significant amount of their cash operating expenses payable in either the Euro or British Pound, and we typically maintain forward contracts settling monthly in Euros and British Pounds. In addition, our Brazilian operations have a significant amount of their operating expenses payable in the Brazilian Real and during the fourth quarter of 2009, we began hedging those positions with forward contracts. At December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding cash flow hedge forward contracts. The aggregate notional amount of these forward contracts, expressed in U.S. Dollars, was $48 million at December 31, 2009. A ten percent change in exchange rates in the Euro, Pound, and Real would change the fair value of these forward contracts by approximately $5 million. We have entered into a firm commitment for the construction of a newbuild drillship. The drillship will be constructed in two phases, with the second phase being installation and commissioning of the topside equipment. Our payment obligation for this second phase of construction is denominated in Euros, and in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we entered into forward contracts to purchase Euros. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate notional amount of the remaining forward contracts was 50 million Euros. Each forward contract settles in connection with required payments under the contract. We are accounting for these forward contracts as fair value hedges. The fair market value of those derivative instruments is included in Other current assets/liabilities or Other assets/liabilities, depending on when the forward contract is expected to be settled. Gains and losses from these fair value hedges are recognized in earnings currently along with the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The fair market value of these outstanding forward contracts, which are included in Other current liabilities and Other liabilities, totaled approximately $0.8 million at December 31, 2009. A ten percent change in the exchange rate for the Euro would change the fair value of these forward contracts by approximately $7 million. 44 Table of Contents Market Risk We sponsor the Noble Drilling Corporation 401(k) Savings Restoration Plan (Restoration Plan). The Restoration Plan is a nonqualified, unfunded employee benefit plan under which certain highly compensated employees may elect to defer compensation in excess of amounts deferrable under our 401(k) savings plan. The Restoration Plan has no assets, and amounts withheld for the Restoration Plan are kept by us for general corporate purposes. The investments selected by employees and the associated returns are tracked on a phantom basis. Accordingly, we have a liability to employees for amounts originally withheld plus phantom investment income or less phantom investment losses. We are at risk for phantom investment income and, conversely, benefit should phantom investment losses occur. At December 31, 2009, our liability under the Restoration Plan totaled $8 million. During 2008, we purchased investments that closely correlate to the investment elections made by participants in the Restoration Plan in order to mitigate the impact of the phantom investment income and losses on our consolidated financial statements. The value of these investments held for our benefit totaled $8 million at December 31, 2009. A ten percent change in the fair value of the phantom investments would change our liability by approximately $0.8 million. Any change in the fair value of the phantom investments would be mitigated by a change in the investments held for our benefit. We also have a U.S. noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers certain salaried employees and a U.S. noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers certain hourly employees, whose initial date of employment is prior to August 1, 2004 (collectively referred to as our qualified U.S. plans). These plans are governed by the Noble Drilling Corporation Retirement Trust (the Trust). The benefits from these plans are based primarily on years of service and, for the salaried plan, employees compensation near retirement. These plans are designed to qualify under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and our funding policy is consistent with funding requirements of ERISA and other applicable laws and regulations. We make cash contributions, or utilize credits available to us, for the qualified U.S. plans when required. The benefit amount that can be covered by the qualified U.S. plans is limited under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) of 1986. Therefore, we maintain an unfunded, nonqualified excess benefit plan designed to maintain benefits for all employees at the formula level in the qualified U.S. plans. We refer to the qualified U.S. plans and the excess benefit plan collectively as the U.S. plans. In addition to the U.S. plans, each of Noble Drilling (Land Support) Limited, Noble Enterprises Limited and Noble Drilling (Nederland) B.V., all indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of Noble Swiss, maintains a pension plan that covers all of its salaried, non union employees (collectively referred to as our non U.S. plans). Benefits are based on credited service and employees compensation near retirement, as defined by the plans. Changes in market asset value related to the pension plans noted above could have a material impact upon our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and could result in material cash expenditures in future periods. 45 Table of Contents
