Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2010. You should read the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes in conjunction with this discussion. Executive Overview Our 2010 financial and operating results include: operating revenues totaling $2.8 billion; net income of $773 million or $3.02 per diluted share; net cash from operating activities totaling $1.7 billion; and an increase in debt to 27.5 percent of total capitalization at the end of 2010, up from 10.0 percent at the end of 2009 due to the issuance of $1.25 billion in debt and the assumption of $689 million in consolidated joint venture debt to fund the acquisition of Frontier. The overall offshore drilling market has been challenging since the events occurring in connection with the Deepwater Horizon and the U.S. governmental response to the incident. Despite the lifting of the moratorium and publication of new safety rules, we are unable to predict when normal drilling operations will resume in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and we believe it is unlikely that we will see significant activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for some time as indicated by the difficulties surrounding the issuance of new drilling permits. Outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, demand has been fairly steady, but well below the previous peak levels of 2008. We believe the risk for early contract terminations or defaults under existing contracts has decreased and the overall future market for offshore drilling activity is positive. Despite improvements in the economy, there is still uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the global economic recovery, which is proceeding unevenly in different geographic regions. In addition, there is still uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the recovery of the global financial markets highlighted by issues in the credit markets. During 2010, oil prices increased fifteen percent while U.S. natural gas prices decreased almost twenty percent. While we believe that this improvement in oil prices will result in increased drilling activity in 2011, we continue to anticipate volatility in our industry for the foreseeable future. Despite the increase in commodity prices, we have not seen a significant increase in demand for offshore drilling services. Developments in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico will continue to have an impact on the deepwater market segment in the short term, however, we believe that the long term outlook is stronger. Market dayrates for new ultra deepwater units remain generally above $400,000, which is a significantly lower than the rates in 2007 2008. Demand in the jackup segment increased during 2010 and utilization for units operating outside the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was approximately 80 percent. We did not operate any jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010. During 2010, we started to see differentiation in the jackup market segment with newer units having utilization rates exceeding 90 percent, while units that entered service before 2000 having utilization rates closer to 70 percent. Likewise, there has been a bifurcation of dayrates between older and newer units in the jackup market with new units earning a premium. Dayrates for both older and newer units have been relatively stable over the second half of 2010, but significantly lower than the highs reached during 2007 and 2008. Demand for our drilling services generally depends on a variety of economic and political factors, including worldwide demand for oil and gas, the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and pricing, the level of production of non OPEC countries and the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves. Our results of operations depend on offshore drilling activity worldwide. Historically, oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices have significantly affected that level of activity. Generally, higher oil and natural gas prices or our customers expectations of higher prices result in greater demand for our services and lower oil and gas prices result in reduced demand for our services. Demand for our services is also a function of the worldwide supply of mobile offshore drilling units. Industry sources report that a total of 55 newbuild jackups and 61 deepwater newbuilds are planned or under construction with scheduled delivery dates in 2011 and beyond. Industry analysts have predicted that a new wave of speculative building of both jackups and ultra deepwater units has commenced. The introduction of additional non contracted rigs into the marketplace could have an adverse effect on demand for our services or the dayrates we are able to achieve. 28 Table of Contents In addition, as a result of exploration discoveries offshore Brazil, Petrobras, the Brazilian national oil company, announced a plan to construct up to 28 deepwater rigs in Brazil and recently accepted bids to construct these units from a number of shipyards and drilling contractors. Petrobras originally declared its intention to finance and own the first nine of these additional rigs. Petrobras also stated that they would seek long term contracts for the remaining 19 rigs to support construction and to allow drilling contractors to bid for the opportunity to supply up to four rigs per contractor. During 2010, shipyards and Brazilian contractors submitted bids to build deepwater rigs for Petrobras. A deepwater drilling rig construction industry does not currently exist in Brazil and Noble did not participate in these bids primarily because we felt the capital risk associated with constructing a unit in Brazil at this time was inappropriate. On February 11, 2011, media reported that Petrobras had awarded the first tranche of seven drillships to a Brazilian shipyard for delivery beginning in 2015. The future of Petrobras building program remains uncertain and the ultimate number of deepwater rigs to be built in Brazil is still unknown. While Petrobras is currently in the market tendering for existing deepwater drilling units, the potential increase in supply from the Petrobras newbuild could also adversely impact overall industry dayrates and economics. As of January 19, 2011, we had five jackup units operating with Pemex in Mexico, all of which have contracts scheduled to expire in 2011. Pemex has approved extensions to contracts for certain of these rigs as the contracts have reached expiration and has issued four fast track tenders aimed at keeping units working through the first quarter of 2011, but has allowed some of our other rigs to become available. Some recent tenders published by Pemex contain a requirement that certain units must have entered service since the year 2000. While Pemex has not yet succeeded in securing a significant number of younger rigs, we cannot predict whether this age requirement will be present in future Pemex tenders. If this requirement is present in future tenders, it could require us to seek work for our rigs in other locations, as the ages of our rigs currently operating in Mexico do not meet this requirement. If such work is not available, it could lead to additional idle time on some of our rigs. We cannot predict how many rigs might be affected or how long they could remain idle. As of February 11, 2011, tenders for 14 jackup rigs had been published. These tenders do not contain age restrictions and are due to be opened in the first quarter of 2011 with work commencing in the first and second quarters of 2011. We remain optimistic that many, if not all, of our rigs currently operating in Mexico will continue to work for Pemex. In January 2011, we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Petrobras regarding operations in Brazil. Under the terms of the MOU, we would substitute the dynamically positioned deepwater drillship Noble Phoenix, then under contract with Shell in Southeast Asia, for the dynamically positioned drillship Noble Muravlenko. In January 2011, Shell agreed to release the Noble Phoenix from its contract. Upon release by Shell, the Noble Phoenix will undergo limited contract preparations, after which the unit would mobilize to Brazil. We expect that acceptance of the Noble Phoenix in Brazil by Petrobras will take place in the fourth quarter of 2011. In connection with the cancelation of the contract on the Noble Phoenix, we recognized a non cash gain of approximately $55 million in the first quarter of 2011. In January 2011, we reached a decision that we will not proceed with the previously announced reliability upgrade to the Noble Muravlenko that was scheduled to take place in 2013. As a result of the cancelation of the upgrade, we expect that our first quarter 2011 results will include an associated non cash impairment charge currently estimated to be approximately $40 million. In connection with our existing drilling contracts with Petrobras for two of our drillships operating in Brazil, we approved certain shipyard reliability upgrade projects for these drillships, the Noble Leo Segerius, and the Noble Roger Eason. These upgrade projects, planned for 2010 through 2012, are designed to enhance the reliability and operational performance of these drillships. There are a number of risks associated with shipyard projects of this nature, particularly in Brazil, including potential project delays and cost overruns due to labor, customs, local shipyard, local content and other issues. In addition, the drilling contracts for these vessels provide Petrobras with certain rights of termination in the event of excessive downtime, and it is possible that Petrobras could exercise this right in the future with respect to one or more of these drillships. We intend to continue to closely monitor and discuss with Petrobras the status of these projects and plan to take appropriate steps to mitigate identified risks, which depending upon the circumstances could involve a variety of options. In January 2011, we canceled an upgrade project on a third drillship in Brazil, the Noble Muravlenko. 29 Table of Contents While we cannot predict the future level of demand for our drilling services or future conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, we continue to believe we are well positioned within the industry and believe our acquisition of Frontier further strengthens our position, especially in deepwater drilling. Furthermore, we believe that our financial strength as demonstrated by our entrance into a new credit facility and our recent sale of $1.1 billion of senior notes will continue to serve us well if additional opportunities present themselves in the future. Our business strategy continues to be the active expansion of our worldwide offshore drilling and deepwater capabilities whereby we move our fleet towards the latest technology while maintaining the highest level of operational integrity with respect to health, safety, and the environment. Historically, we have accomplished this via rig and hull upgrades and modifications, acquisitions, and divestitures of lower specification units. While divestitures of non competitive assets continue to be a part of the strategy, many of our existing units have been upgraded to their technical limits and our ability to complete acquisitions has been limited by market conditions. As a result, in recent years, we have actively expanded our fleet through the construction of new rigs, including jackups and drillships. In all of our investment decisions we seek to achieve a strong return on capital for the benefit of our shareholders. During 2010, we continued our strategy as indicated by the following activities: we completed the acquisition of Frontier which added a total of five drillships (including two Bully class joint venture owned drillships under construction and to be completed in 2011), one semisubmersible and an FPSO to the fleet; we completed construction on the Noble Dave Beard, a dynamically positioned ultra deepwater semisubmersible that left the shipyard during the first quarter of 2010 and began operating under a long term contract in Brazil; we completed construction on the Noble Jim Day, a dynamically positioned ultra deepwater semisubmersible that left the shipyard during the third quarter of 2010; we continued construction on one dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment Globetrotter class drillship, which is scheduled to be delivered to our customer in the fourth quarter of 2011; we began construction on one dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment Globetrotter class drillship, which is scheduled to be delivered to our customer in the fourth quarter of 2013; and we announced we would construct two high specification heavy duty, harsh environment jackup rigs both of which are scheduled to be delivered during 2013. In addition to the 2010 projects listed above, in January 2011 we announced we would construct two additional newbuild drillships at Hyundai Heavy Industry (HHI). The new ultra deepwater drillships, to be named at a later date, will be constructed on a fixed price basis with expected deliveries from the shipyard in the second and fourth quarters of 2013, respectively. We have a letter of intent for one of these units for a five and one half year contract with a subsidiary of Shell at a dayrate of $410,000, plus a 15 percent performance bonus opportunity. We have also negotiated options for two additional jackups and two additional HHI drillships. Excluding the Frontier acquisition, capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion during 2010. Acquisition of Frontier Holdings Limited On July 28, 2010, Noble Swiss and Noble AM Merger Co., a Cayman Islands company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Swiss (Merger Sub), completed the acquisition of FDR Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands company (Frontier). Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Frontier and certain of Frontiers shareholders, Merger Sub merged with and into Frontier, with Frontier surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Swiss and a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Cayman. The Frontier acquisition was for a purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion in cash plus liabilities assumed and strategically expanded and enhanced our global fleet by adding three dynamically positioned drillships (including two Bully class joint venture owned drillships under construction), two conventionally moored drillships, including one that is Arctic class, a conventionally moored deepwater semisubmersible and one dynamically positioned FPSO to our fleet. Frontiers results of operations were included in our results beginning July 28, 2010. We funded the cash consideration paid at closing of approximately $1.7 billion using proceeds from our July 2010 offering of senior notes and existing cash on hand. 30 Table of Contents U.S. Gulf of Mexico Operations Subsequent to the April 20, 2010 fire and explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, a competitors drilling rig in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, U.S. governmental authorities implemented a moratorium on and suspension of specified types of drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. On October 12, 2010, the U.S. government lifted the moratorium following adoption of new regulations including a drilling safety rule and a workplace safety rule, each of which imposed multiple obligations relating to offshore drilling operations. These obligations relate to, among other things, additional certifications and verifications relating to compliance with applicable regulations; compatibility of blowout preventers with drilling rigs and well design; third party inspections and design review of blowout preventers; testing of casing installations; minimum requirements for personnel operating blowout preventers; and training in deepwater well control. In addition, the U.S. government has indicated that before any new deepwater drilling resumes, (i) operators must demonstrate that containment resources are available promptly in the event of a deepwater blowout, (ii) the chief executive officer of each operator seeking to perform deepwater drilling must certify that the operator has complied with all applicable regulations and (iii) the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement will conduct inspections of each deepwater drilling operation for compliance with the applicable regulations. Our existing U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations have been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the events and governmental action described above. As of December 31, 2010, our U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations included eight deepwater drilling units: the Noble Amos Runner, Noble Clyde Boudreaux, Noble Danny Adkins, Noble Jim Thompson, Noble Driller, Noble Paul Romano, Noble Lorris Bouzigard and Noble Jim Day. We estimate the negative impact to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 to be approximately $450 million. We have worked and continue to work closely with our customers for drilling services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to address the hardships imposed by the governmental actions described above. The discussion below briefly describes the current status of each of these drilling units. Noble Amos Runner. The Noble Amos Runner received its blow out preventer (BOP) certification and is currently operating in place of the Noble Lorris Bouzigard for LLOG Exploration, LLC (LLOG) at the full dayrate under the Noble Lorris Bouzigard contract. Noble Clyde Boudreaux. In late June 2010, we reached agreement with our customer, Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy), relating to the Noble Clyde Boudreaux to place the drilling unit on standby for a daily rate of $145,000 per day from June 15 through December 12, 2010. This unit has received its BOP certification. We have been awarded a letter of intent for this drilling unit by a subsidiary of Shell for work in Brazil. We expect to mobilize the unit in the first quarter of 2011. Noble Danny Adkins. This unit received its BOP certification. The unit currently is operating under a permit, however, we cannot guarantee that our customer Shell will be able to continue to secure required permits, at which point, it could return to the lower stand by rate. Noble Jim Thompson. This unit is under contract with Shell and is receiving a reduced stand by rate. This unit has received its BOP certification. Noble Driller. This unit is under contract with Shell and is receiving a reduced stand by rate while undergoing a shipyard project. This unit is expected to receive its BOP certification in the second quarter of 2011. Noble Paul Romano. This unit is idle, having completed its drilling contract in June 2010. The unit has received its BOP certification and is being actively marketed to potential customers. 31 Table of Contents Noble Lorris Bouzigard. Prior to being swapped with the Noble Amos Runner this unit was under contract with LLOG. Currently, this drilling unit is cold stacked, but is being actively marketed to potential customers. Noble Jim Day. Effective December 31, 2010 Marathon Oil Company (Marathon) terminated the drilling contract for the ultra deepwater semisubmersible drilling rig Noble Jim Day. Marathons stated reason for the termination was that the rig had not been accepted by Marathon by the contracted deadline of December 31, 2010. We believe the rig was ready to commence operations and should have been accepted by Marathon. This rig has received its BOP certification. We intend to pursue our rights under the contract against Marathon. In February 2011, we were awarded a letter of intent for this drilling unit by a subsidiary of Shell for work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. It is still unclear when normal operations will resume, what the cost of additional safety measures will be and how additional regulations will impact our operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Consummation of Migration and Internal Restructuring On March 26, 2009, we completed a series of transactions that effectively changed the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland. As a result of these transactions, Noble Cayman, our former publicly traded parent company, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Swiss, our current publicly traded parent company. Noble Swiss principal asset is all of the shares of Noble Cayman. Noble Cayman has no public equity outstanding after March 26, 2009. The consolidated financial statements of Noble Swiss include the accounts of Noble Cayman, and Noble Swiss conducts substantially all of its business through Noble Cayman and its subsidiaries. In connection with these transactions, we relocated our principal executive offices, executive officers and selected personnel to Geneva, Switzerland. Contract Drilling Services Backlog We maintain a backlog (as defined below) of commitments for contract drilling services. The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2010 the amount of our contract drilling services backlog and the percent of available operating days committed for the periods indicated: Year Ending December 31, Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2023 (In millions) Contract Drilling Services Backlog Semisubmersibles/Drillships (1) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) $ 11,430 $ 1,637 $ 1,760 $ 1,642 $ 1,707 $ 4,684 Jackups/Submersibles (2) 1,263 707 304 182 67 3 Other Total (3) $ 12,693 $ 2,344 $ 2,064 $ 1,824 $ 1,774 $ 4,687 Percent of Available Operating Days Committed (4) 53 % 31 % 25 % 19 % 5 % (1) Our drilling contracts with Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) provide an opportunity for us to earn performance bonuses based on downtime experienced for our rigs operating offshore Brazil. With respect to our semisubmersibles operating offshore Brazil, we have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of potential performance bonuses for such semisubmersibles, which amount is based on and generally consistent with our historical earnings of performance bonuses for these rigs. With respect to our drillships operating offshore Brazil, we (a) have not included in our backlog any performance bonuses for periods prior to the commencement of certain upgrade projects planned for 2011 through 2012, which projects are designed to enhance the reliability and operational performance of our drillships, and (b) have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of potential performance bonuses for periods after the estimated completion of such upgrade projects. Our backlog for semisubmersibles/drillships includes approximately $269 million attributable to these performance bonuses. 32 Table of Contents The drilling contracts with Shell for the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II, and Noble Phoenix, as well as the three year extension for the Noble Jim Thompson, provide opportunities for us to earn performance bonuses based on key performance indicators as defined by Shell. With respect to these contracts, we have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of the potential performance bonuses for these rigs. Our backlog for these rigs includes approximately $410 million attributable to these performance bonuses. (2) Our drilling contracts with Pemex Exploracion y Produccion (Pemex) for certain jackups operating offshore in Mexico are subject to price review and adjustment of the rig dayrate. Presently, the contract for one jackup has a dayrate indexed to the world average of the highest dayrates published by ODS Petrodata. After an initial firm dayrate period, the dayrate is generally adjusted quarterly based on formulas calculated from the index. Our contract drilling services backlog has been calculated using the December 31, 2010 index based dayrate for periods subsequent to the firm dayrate period. (3) Pemex has the ability to cancel its drilling contracts on 30 days or less notice without Pemexs making an early termination payment. At December 31, 2010 we had six rigs contracted to Pemex in Mexico and our backlog includes approximately $147 million related to such contracts. Also, our drilling contracts generally provide the customer an early termination right in the event we fail to meet certain performance standards, including downtime thresholds. While we do not currently anticipate any cancellations as a result of events that have occurred to date, clients may from time to time have the contractual right to do so. (4) Percentages take into account additional capacity from the estimated dates of deployment of our newbuild rigs that are scheduled to commence operations during 2011 through 2013. (5) It is not possible to determine the impact to our revenues or backlog resulting from the U.S. government imposed restrictions, efforts by operators to cancel or modify drilling contracts, and other consequences of the actions by the U.S. government. At December 31, 2010, backlog related to our U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater rigs totaled $5.6 billion, $471 million of which represents backlog for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2011. We entered into an agreement with Shell, effective June 27, 2010, which provides that Shell may suspend the contracts on three of our units operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during any period of regulatory restriction by paying reduced suspension dayrates in lieu of the normal operating dayrates. The term of the initial contract is also extended by the suspension period. The impact of this agreement is to shift backlog among periods with an immaterial increase to total backlog because of the reduced suspension rates. (6) The Noble Homer Ferrington is under contract with a subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation (ExxonMobil), who entered into an assignment agreement with BP for a two well farmout of the rig in Libya after successfully drilling two wells with the rig for ExxonMobil. In August 2010, BP attempted to terminate the assignment agreement claiming that the rig was not in the required condition. ExxonMobil has informed us that we must look to BP for payment of the dayrate during the assignment period. In August 2010, we initiated arbitration proceedings under the drilling contract against both BP and ExxonMobil. We do not believe BP had the right to terminate the assignment agreement and believe the rig continues to be fully ready to operate under the drilling contract. We believe we are owed dayrate by either or both of these customers. The operating dayrate was approximately $538,000 per day for the work in Libya. We are proceeding with the arbitration process and intend to vigorously pursue these claims. (7) Noble and a subsidiary of Shell are involved in joint venture agreements to build, operate, and own both the Noble Bully I and the Noble Bully II. Pursuant to these agreements, each party has an equal 50 percent share in both vessels. As of December 31, 2010, the combined amount of backlog for these rigs totals $2.4 billion, all of which is included in backlog. Nobles net interest in the backlog for these rigs is $1.2 billion. (8) As described in U.S. Gulf of Mexico Operations, effective December 31, 2010, Marathon terminated the drilling contract for the Noble Jim Day, which represented approximately $752 million in contract backlog. Such amounts have been excluded from our backlog as of December 31, 2010. (9) As described in Executive Overview, subsequent to December 31, 2010, we announced an MOU with Petrobras whereby we would substitute the Noble Phoenix for the Noble Muravlenko and Shell agreed to release the Noble Phoenix from its contract. These transactions have not been reflected in backlog as of December 31, 2010 and will reduce our prospective backlog by approximately $460 million. Our contract drilling services backlog reported above reflects estimated future revenues attributable to both signed drilling contracts and letters of intent that we expect to become firm. A letter of intent is generally subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive drilling contract. It is possible that some customers that have entered into letters of intent will not enter into signed drilling contracts. We calculate backlog for any given unit and period by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate for such unit by the number of days remaining in the period. The reported contract drilling services backlog does not include amounts representing revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling services revenues, amounts constituting reimbursables from customers or amounts attributable to uncommitted option periods under drilling contracts or letters of intent. The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may be different than the backlog amounts and backlog periods set forth in the table above due to various factors, including, but not limited to, shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime, weather conditions and other factors that result in applicable dayrates lower than the full contractual operating dayrate. In addition, amounts included in the backlog may change because drilling contracts may be varied or modified by mutual consent or customers may exercise early termination rights contained in some of our drilling contracts or decline to enter into a drilling contract after executing a letter of intent. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for the periods for which the backlog is calculated. 33 Table of Contents Internal Investigation In 2007, we began, and voluntarily contacted the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to advise them of, an internal investigation of the legality under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and local laws of certain reimbursement payments made by our Nigerian affiliate to our customs agents in Nigeria. In November 2010, we finalized settlements of this matter with each of the SEC and the DOJ. In order to resolve the DOJ investigation, we entered into a non prosecution agreement with the DOJ, which provides for the payment of a fine of $2.6 million, as well as certain undertakings, including continued cooperation with the DOJ, compliance with the FCPA, certain self reporting and annual reporting obligations and certain restrictions on our public discussion regarding the agreement. The agreement does not require that we install a monitor to oversee our activities and compliance with laws. In order to resolve the SEC investigation, we agreed to the entry of a civil judgment against us for violations of the FCPA. Pursuant to the agreed judgment, we agreed to disgorge profits of $4.3 million, pay prejudgment interest of $1.3 million and refrain from denying the allegations contained in the SECs petition, except in other litigation to which the SEC is not a party. We also agreed to an injunction restraining us from violating the anti bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and we waived a variety of litigation rights with respect to the conduct at issue. The agreed judgment does not require a monitor. Our ability to comply with the terms of the settlements is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents and supervise, train and retain competent employees, and the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our code of business conduct and ethics. In January 2011, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Nigerian Attorney General Office initiated an investigation into these same activities. A subsidiary of Noble Swiss resolved this matter through the execution of a non prosecution agreement dated January 28, 2011. Pursuant to this agreement, the subsidiary paid $2.5 million to resolve all charges and claims of the Nigerian government. Any additional sanctions we may incur as a result of any such investigation could damage our reputation and result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, resolving any such investigation could be expensive and consume significant time and attention of our senior management. We have one jackup rig in Nigeria which is operating under a temporary import permit which expired in November 2008 and we have a pending application to renew this permit. We have received approval from the Nigerian Customs office that we will be allowed to obtain a new temporary import permit for this rig. We recently received a new temporary import permit for another rig in Nigeria that had been waiting for a temporary import permit based on a long standing application. We continue to seek to avoid material disruption to our Nigerian operations; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new permits or further extensions of permits necessary to continue the operation of our rigs in Nigeria. If we cannot obtain a new permit or an extension necessary to continue operations of any rig, we may need to cease operations under the drilling contract for such rig and relocate such rig from Nigerian waters. We cannot predict what impact these events may have on any such contract or our business in Nigeria, and we could face additional fines and sanctions in Nigeria. Furthermore, we cannot predict what changes, if any, relating to temporary import permit policies and procedures may be established or implemented in Nigeria in the future, or how any such changes may impact our business there. 34 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Compared to 2009 General Net income attributable to Noble Corporation for 2010 was $773 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $2.8 billion, compared to net income for 2009 of $1.7 billion, or $6.42 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.6 billion. The consolidated financial statements of Noble Swiss include the accounts of Noble Cayman, and Noble Swiss conducts substantially all of its business through Noble Cayman and its subsidiaries. As a result, the financial position and results of operations for Noble Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2010 and 2009, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble Swiss in all material respects, except operating income for Noble Cayman for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $42 million higher than operating income for Noble Swiss for the same period, primarily as a result of costs directly attributable to Noble Swiss for stewardship related services. Rig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates Operating revenues and operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics rig utilization, operating days and dayrates.

Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues. The decrease in contract drilling services revenue for 2010 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by reductions in both average dayrates and utilization. Lower dayrates decreased revenues approximately $798 million, while fewer operating days decreased revenues by approximately $16 million. The reduction in utilization was partially offset by the acquisition of Frontier and the addition of newbuilds. The decrease in contract drilling services revenue related primarily to our jackups and semisubmersibles, which generated approximately $679 million and $248 million less revenue for the current year as compared to the prior year, respectively. The decrease in jackup revenue was from a 34 percent decline in dayrates primarily from the contractual re pricing of rigs in the Middle East, the North Sea, and Mexico resulting from changes in market conditions in the global shallow water market. Reductions in average dayrates by 22 percent contributed to the decline in semisubmersible revenue. These reductions resulted from the drilling restrictions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico where lower standby rates replaced the standard operating dayrates for a majority of our customers, lower utilization from the termination of certain contracts and a dispute with a customer over the Noble Homer Ferrington contract. The decreases in revenue for the above rig classes were partially offset by higher revenues from our drillships and other rigs, which increased $113 million in the current year as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the drillships and FPSO added to the fleet as part of the Frontier acquisition of $143 million, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our drillships operating in Brazil. Operating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses increased $171 million for the current year as compared to the prior year. Our newbuild rigs, the Noble Scott Marks, Noble Danny Adkins and Noble Dave Beard, which were added to the fleet in June 2009, October 2009 and March 2010, respectively, added approximately $109 million of operating costs in 2010. The acquisition of the Frontier rigs added an additional $55 million of operating costs. Excluding the additional expenses related to these newbuild and Frontier rigs, our contract drilling costs increased $7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This change was principally due to acquisition costs of $19 million coupled with increases in safety costs of $4 million, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance expenses of $9 million and a decrease in transportation and other expenses of $7 million. 36 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased $129 million in 2010 over 2009 as a result of depreciation on newbuilds placed into service, and additional depreciation related to other capital expenditures on our fleet since the beginning of 2009. Also, the acquisition of Frontier added approximately $39 million in depreciation during the current year. Loss on asset disposal/involuntary conversion in 2009 primarily consists of a charge of $17 million for our jackup, the Noble David Tinsley, which experienced a punch through while being positioned on location offshore Qatar. The $17 million charge includes approximately $9 million for the write off of the damaged legs and $8 million for non reimbursable expenses. Also during 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $12 million for the Noble Fri Rodli as a result of a decision to evaluate disposition alternatives for this submersible drilling unit.

Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues and Costs and Expenses. Revenues and expenses associated with our Canadian labor contract drilling services increased in the current year primarily for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates coupled with increased labor and contract drilling services costs. The increase in depreciation results from fixed asset additions in conjunction with the relocation of our corporate offices to Switzerland. Other Income and Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12 million in 2010 from 2009 primarily as a result of the FCPA settlement of $8 million, along with increases in employee related costs of $2 million, increases in consulting fees of $2 million and Swiss VAT taxes of $2 million, partially offset by the worldwide asset consolidation project and migration costs and other expenses in 2009 of $2 million. 37 Table of Contents Interest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized increased $8 million primarily for the addition of $1.25 billion of debt issued in July 2010 to partially fund the Frontier acquisition. Income Tax Provision. Our income tax provision decreased $194 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction in pre tax earnings combined with a lower effective tax rate. Pre tax earnings decreased approximately 55 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 resulting in a reduction of approximately $184 million in income tax expense. The lower effective tax rate, which was 15.6 percent in 2010 compared to 16.7 percent in 2009, reduced income tax expense by approximately $10 million. 2009 Compared to 2008 General Net income for 2009 was $1.7 billion, or $6.42 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.6 billion, compared to net income for 2008 of $1.6 billion, or $5.81 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.4 billion. Rig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates Operating revenues and operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2009 and 2008: Average Rig Operating Average Utilization (1) Days (2) Dayrates 2009 2008 2009 2008 % Change 2009 2008 % Change Jackups 82 % 92 % 12,719 13,879 8 % $ 147,701 $ 148,532 1 % Semisubmersibles 6000 (3) 98 % 96 % 2,578 2,466 5 % 417,177 327,558 27 % Semisubmersibles 6000 (4) 100 % 100 % 1,095 1,098 0 % 253,557 220,475 15 % Drillships 91 % 67 % 993 732 36 % 254,084 201,819 26 % Submersibles (5) 51 % 66 % 418 729 43 % 61,711 54,106 14 % Total 84 % 90 % 17,803 18,904 6 % $ 197,143 $ 174,506 13 % (1) Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of actively marketed rigs in our fleet excluding newbuild rigs under construction.

Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues. Contract drilling services revenue increases for 2009 as compared to 2008 were primarily driven by increases in average dayrates. Average dayrates increased revenues approximately $428 million for 2009, while fewer operating days reduced revenues approximately $217 million. Average dayrates increased 13 percent in 2009 as compared to 2008. Except for our jackup rigs, which were impacted by the weakening demand in the shallow waters worldwide, higher average dayrates were received across all other rig categories as scheduled contractual increases for deepwater rigs, coupled with the completion of additional deepwater rigs, drove average dayrates higher in those classes. The decrease in operating days in 2009 as compared 2008 was primarily due to downtime of certain rigs in 2009. Unpaid shipyard days increased 498 days in 2009 as compared to 2008, as we had 21 rigs spend time in the shipyard during 2009. We had only 12 rigs with unpaid shipyard days in 2008. Additionally, stacked days increased 850 days as the Noble Al White, Noble Byron Welliver, Noble Dick Favor, Noble Don Walker, Noble Fri Rodli, Noble Joe Beall, Noble Joe Alford, Noble Lester Pettus, Noble Lloyd Noble and Noble Tommy Craighead each were stacked for certain periods during 2009. In 2008, five rigs, the Noble Carl Norberg, Noble Don Walker, Noble Fri Rodli, Noble Joe Alford, and the Noble Roy Butler, spent a significant number of days stacked. The decrease in operating days in 2009 was partially offset by a 576 day increase in available days for the enhanced premium jackups Noble Hans Deul and Noble Scott Marks, which were placed into service in November 2008 and June 2009, respectively, and the addition of the semisubmersible Noble Danny Adkins, which began operating under contract in October 2009. We also had 275 less available days in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the Noble Fri Rodli being removed from our rig fleet effective March 31, 2009. Additionally, 2009 had one less available operating day than 2008 due to the leap year, which reduced available days in 2009 by 54 days. Operating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses decreased $5 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. Our newbuild rigs, the Noble Hans Deul, Noble Scott Marks, and the Noble Danny Adkins, which were placed into service in November 2008, June 2009, and October 2009, respectively, added approximately $34 million of operating costs in 2009. Excluding the additional expenses related to our newbuild rigs, our contract drilling costs decreased $39 million in 2009 versus 2008. This change was primarily driven by a $42 million decrease in local labor costs due to the increased number of rigs stacked during 2009 and an $18 million decrease in insurance costs from our insurance program under which we are predominately self insured. These decreases were partially offset by a $9 million increase in miscellaneous transportation and fuel costs, a $9 million increase in mobilization costs and a $3 million increase in other operating cost and expenses. 39 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased $49 million in 2009 over 2008 due to depreciation on newbuilds placed into service, and additional depreciation related to other capital expenditures on our fleet since the beginning of 2008. Since the beginning of 2008, we have spent $2.6 billion on contract drilling capital expenditures. Loss on asset disposal/involuntary conversion in 2009 primarily consists of a charge of $17 million for our jackup, the Noble David Tinsley, which experienced a punch through while being positioned on location offshore Qatar. The $17 million charge includes approximately $9 million for the write off of the damaged legs and $8 million for non reimbursable expenses.

Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The reduction in reimbursables for 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business in 2008. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues. Our labor contract drilling services revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business in April 2008. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2008, we returned the jackup Noble Kolskaya, which we had operated under a bareboat charter, to its owner. Revenues during 2008 related to our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and the Noble Kolskaya were $22 million in 2008. The remaining variance is due to currency exchange fluctuations and decreases related to revenue from the platform that we operate in Canada. Operating Costs and Expenses. Labor contract drilling services costs and expenses decreased $24 million due to the sale of our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and the return of the Noble Kolskaya to its owner in 2008. Expenses during 2008 related to our North Sea labor contract drilling services business and Noble Kolskaya were $19 million. Operating costs associated with our Canadian labor contracts in 2009 decreased $5 million from 2008 primarily as a result of decreases in operations under the Hibernia contract and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 40 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to $7 million in costs related to our re domestication from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland, a $6 million increase in salaries and employment related costs, $4 million in charges related to our worldwide internal restructuring, and a $3 million increase due to our Restoration Plan mark to market adjustment, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in costs incurred in the internal investigation of our Nigerian operations, and a $2 million decrease in other selling general and administrative expenses. Interest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized decreased $3 million primarily due to repayments of debt not subject to interest capitalization coupled with higher capital expenditures, and capitalized interest, in 2009 as compared to 2008. Capitalized interest was $55 million for 2009 versus $48 million for 2008. Income Tax Provision. Our income tax provision decreased $14 million primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008. The lower effective tax rate of 16.7 percent in 2009 compared to 18.4 percent in 2008 decreased income tax expense by approximately $34 million. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 resulted primarily from the worldwide internal restructuring that took place in October 2009 and from higher pre tax earnings of non U.S. owned assets, which generally have a lower statutory tax rate. This decrease was partially offset by increased pre tax earnings of approximately $103 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our principal capital resource in 2010 was net cash from operating activities of $1.7 billion, which compared to $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to lower operating revenues partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $338 million and $560 million available under our bank credit facility. Total debt as a percentage of total debt plus total equity was 27.5 percent and 10.0 percent at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As a result of the cash generated by our operations, our cash on hand, the availability under our bank credit facilities and the bond offering proceeds discussed below, we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs for 2011 including: normal recurring operating expenses; capital expenditures, including expenditures for newbuilds and upgrades; repurchase of shares; payments of return of capital in the form of a reduction of par value of our shares (in lieu of dividends); and contributions to our pension plans. 41 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Our primary liquidity requirement in 2011 will be for capital expenditures. Excluding the fair value of assets acquired as part of the Frontier acquisition, we had total capital expenditures of $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010, we had six rigs under construction, and capital expenditures for new construction in 2010 totaled $653 million. Capital expenditures for newbuild rigs consisted of the following (in millions): Expenditures Project in 2010 Noble Globetrotter II $ 174.9 Noble Globetrotter I 134.6 Noble Jim Day 115.2 Noble Bully II 58.0 Newbuild Jackup #1 40.0 Newbuild Jackup #2 40.0 Noble Bully I 32.1 Other 58.5 Total $ 653.3 Our total capital expenditures budget for 2011 is approximately $2.1 billion. At December 31, 2010, we had entered into certain commitments, including shipyard and purchase commitments for approximately $1.5 billion, of which we expect to spend approximately $955 million in 2011. Subsequent to December 31, 2010, we entered into shipyard commitments of approximately $1.0 billion in connection with the signing of construction contracts for two additional newbuild drillships, and canceled shipyard contracts totaling $77 million in connection with the decision not to proceed with the reliability upgrade on the Noble Muravlenko. We expect to spend approximately $300 million on the two additional newbuild drillships in 2011. Our remaining 2011 capital expenditure budget will generally be spent at our discretion. We may accelerate, delay or cancel certain capital projects, as needed. From time to time we consider possible projects that would require capital expenditures or other cash expenditures that are not included in our capital budget, and such unbudgeted capital or cash expenditures could be significant. In addition, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of drilling units from time to time. Other factors that could cause actual capital expenditures to materially exceed planned capital expenditures include delays and cost overruns in shipyards (including costs attributable to labor shortages), shortages of equipment, latent damage or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions, and changes in design criteria or specifications during repair or construction. Share Repurchases, Distributions of Capital and Dividends Our Board of Directors and shareholders have authorized and adopted a share repurchase program. At December 31, 2010, 6.8 million shares remained available under this authorization. Future repurchases will be subject to the requirements of Swiss law, including the requirement that we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if and to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves are available. Also, the aggregate par value of all registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries, including treasury shares, may not exceed 10 percent of our registered share capital without shareholder approval. Our existing share repurchase program received the required shareholder approval prior to completion of our 2009 Swiss migration transaction. Share repurchases for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010 were as follows: Total Number Average Year Ended of Shares Total Cost Price Paid December 31, Purchased (in thousands) per Share 2010 6,390,488 (1) $ 230,936 $ 36.14 2009 5,470,000 (1) 186,506 34.10 2008 7,965,109 331,514 41.62 (1) Repurchases made subsequent to March 26, 2009, which totaled 10.1 million shares, are being held as treasury shares at December 31, 2010 42 Table of Contents Our most recent quarterly payment to shareholders, in the form of a capital reduction, which was declared on February 4, 2011 and is to be paid on February 24, 2011 to holders of record on February 14, 2011, was 0.13 CHF per share, or an aggregate of approximately $35 million. The declaration and payment of dividends in the future by Noble Swiss and the making of distributions of capital, including returns of capital in the form of par value reductions, require authorization of the shareholders of Noble Swiss. The amount of such dividends, distributions and returns of capital will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors and shareholders. Recently, our Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholder authorization at our upcoming annual general meeting scheduled for April 29, 2011, the payment of a regular return of capital through a reduction of the par value of our shares in a total amount equal to 0.52 CHF per share to be paid in four equal installments scheduled for August 2011, November 2011, February 2012 and May 2012. The payments will be made in U.S. Dollars based on the CHF/USD exchange rate available approximately two business days prior to the payment date. Although the amount of the return of capital, expressed in Swiss francs, is fixed, the amount of the payment in U.S. Dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate. The exchange rate as published by the Swiss National Bank on February 4, 2011 was 0.9463 CHF/1.0 USD. If approved by our shareholders, these returns of capital will require us to make total cash payments of approximately $140 million in 2011 (based on the exchange rate on February 4, 2011). Contributions to Pension Plans In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law in the U.S. The PPA requires that pension plans fund towards a target of at least 100 percent with a transition through 2011 and increases the amount we are allowed to contribute to our U.S. pension plans in the near term. During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we made contributions to our non U.S. and U.S. pension plans totaling $16 million, $18 million and $21 million, respectively. Due to improving market conditions, we expect the minimum aggregate contributions to our non U.S. and U.S. plans in 2011, subject to applicable law, to be $6 million. We continue to monitor and evaluate funding options based upon market conditions and may increase contributions at our discretion. Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt Noble Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt We have a $600 million unsecured bank credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including a debt to total tangible capitalization covenant that limits this ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) to 0.60. As of December 31, 2010, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization as defined by the agreement was 0.22. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $150 million in letters of credit. While the issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding, it does reduce the amount available. At December 31, 2010, we had $40 million in borrowings outstanding and no letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our lenders under the Credit Facility, and we believe that our lenders have the liquidity and capability to perform should the need arise for us to draw on the Credit Facility. The indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes contain covenants that place restrictions on certain merger and consolidation transactions, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the indenture, and on the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, there are restrictions on incurring or assuming certain liens and sale and lease back transactions. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance or received a waiver on all our debt covenants. We continually monitor compliance with the covenants under our notes and, based on our expectations for 2011, expect to remain in compliance during the year. At December 31, 2010, we had letters of credit of $126 million and performance and tax assessment bonds totaling $350 million supported by surety bonds outstanding. Of the letters of credit outstanding, $75 million were issued to support bank bonds in connection with our drilling units in Nigeria. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries issue, from time to time, guarantees to the temporary import status of rigs or equipment imported into certain countries in which we operate. These guarantees are issued in lieu of payment of custom, value added or similar taxes in those countries. 43 Table of Contents In February 2011, we entered into an additional revolving credit facility with an initial capacity of $300 million. The facility will be syndicated to a broader bank group and, subject to certain conditions, have a targeted capacity of $600 million. The facility matures in 2015 and provides us with the ability to issue up to $150 million in letters of credit. The covenants and events of default under the additional revolving credit facility are substantially similar to the Credit Facility, which remains in place. The new facility is guaranteed by our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Noble Holding International Limited (NHIL) and Noble Drilling Corporation. Our total debt was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2010 as compared to $751 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in debt is due to the debt issuances of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes discussed below, the assumption of $691 million of joint venture debt related to the Frontier acquisition and $36 million in joint venture partner debt. For additional information on our long term debt, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. On July 26, 2010, we issued through NHIL, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in three separate tranches, comprising $350 million of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2015, $500 million of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2020, and $400 million of 6.20% Senior Notes due 2040. Proceeds, net of discount and issuance costs, totaled $1.24 billion and were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Frontier acquisition. Noble Cayman fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes on a senior unsecured basis. Interest on all three series of these senior notes is payable semi annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2011. In February 2011, NHIL completed a debt offering of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in three separate tranches, with $300 million of 3.05% Senior Notes due 2016, $400 million of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021, and $400 million of 6.05% Senior Notes due 2041. The weighted average coupon of all three tranches is 4.71%. A portion of the net proceeds of approximately $1.09 billion, after expenses, was used to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and to repay our portion of outstanding debt under the Bully 1 and Bully 2 credit facilities. We expect to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including financing a portion of our 2011 capital program. Joint Venture Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt As part of the Frontier acquisition, we assumed secured non recourse debt related to the Bully 1 and Bully 2 joint ventures. In February 2011, the outstanding balances of the Bully 1 and Bully 2 credit facilities, which totaled $691 million, were repaid in full and the credit facilities terminated using a portion of the proceeds from our February 2011 debt offering and equity contributions from our joint venture partner. In addition, the related interest rate swaps were settled and terminated concurrent with the repayment and termination of the credit facilities. The Bully 1 and Bully 2 credit facilities are discussed further below. The Bully 1 secured non recourse credit facility consisted of a $375 million senior term loan facility, a $40 million senior revolving loan facility and a $50 million junior term loan facility. As of December 31, 2010, loans in an aggregate principal amount of $370 million were outstanding under the senior term loan facility. The senior term loan facility provided for floating interest rates that were fixed for one , three or six month periods at LIBOR plus 2.5% prior to delivery and acceptance of the Noble Bully I drillship. As noted in Note 12 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the joint venture maintained interest rate swaps, with a notional amount of $278 million, to satisfy bank covenants and to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on interest paid. The Bully 1 credit facility was secured by assignments of the major contracts for the construction of the Noble Bully I drillship and its equipment, the drilling contract for the drillship, and various other rights. In connection with the termination of the credit facility, the security interest and related collateral has been released. The Bully 2 secured non recourse credit facility consisted of a $435 million senior term loan facility, a $10 million senior revolving loan facility and a $50 million cost overrun term loan facility. As of December 31, 2010, loans in an aggregate principal amount of $321 million were outstanding under the senior term loan facility. The senior term loan facility provided for floating interest rates that were fixed for three months or such other period selected by the borrower and agreed by the agent (but not to exceed three months), at LIBOR plus 2.5% prior to the occurrence of the delivery date of the hull and thereafter at LIBOR plus 2.3%, until contract commencement. As noted in Note 12 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the joint venture maintained an interest rate swap, with a notional amount of $326 million, to satisfy bank covenants and to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on interest paid. The Bully 2 credit facility was secured by assignments of the major contracts for the construction of the Noble Bully II drillship and its equipment, the drilling contract for the drillship, and various other rights. In connection with the termination of the credit facility, the security interest and related collateral has been released. 44 Table of Contents Certain amendments to the underlying drilling contracts and the revised vessel delivery impact to loan amortization schedules required consent from lenders to both Bully joint ventures. On the Bully 1 credit facility we obtained a waiver regarding certain covenants related to the completion date of the Noble Bully I drillship. The waiver was set to expire on February 28, 2011. In September 2010, the Bully joint ventures issued notes to the joint venture partners totaling $70 million. The interest rate on these notes is 10%, payable semi annually in arrears and in kind on June 30 and December 31 commencing in December 2010. The interest payable due in 2010 was rolled into the principal loan balance of the notes. The purpose of these notes is to provide additional liquidity to these joint ventures in connection with the shipyard construction of the Bully vessels. Our portion of the joint venture partner notes, which totaled $36 million at December 31, 2010, has been eliminated in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The non eliminated portions of these joint venture partner notes totaled $19 million for Bully 1 and $17 million for Bully 2 at December 31, 2010 and are due in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Summary of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Other Contractual Cash Obligations Long term debt obligations (1) $ 2,766,697 $ 80,213 $ 113,457 $ 456,405 $ 369,543 $ 472,232 $ 1,274,847 $ Interest payments 1,437,398 151,502 146,302 131,122 106,667 90,912 810,893 Operating leases 36,964 6,844 4,993 4,733 4,658 3,037 12,699 Pension plan contributions 97,364 6,229 5,895 6,715 7,264 8,190 63,071 Purchase commitments (2) 1,478,447 955,218 394,352 128,877 Tax reserves (3) 144,537 144,537 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,961,407 $ 1,200,006 $ 664,999 $ 727,852 $ 488,132 $ 574,371 $ 2,161,510 $ 144,537 (1) Includes approximately $691 million in Bully debt which was paid off in February 2011. (2) Purchase commitments consist of obligations outstanding to external vendors primarily related to future capital purchases. (3) Tax reserves are included in Other due to the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements to taxing authorities. See Note 10 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2010, we had other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash if the obligations are called. These obligations include letters of credit and surety bonds that guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts, tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions. These letters of credit and surety bond obligations are not normally called as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments at December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Contractual Cash Obligations Letters of Credit $ 126,486 $ 89,798 $ 28,588 $ $ 8,100 $ $ Surety bonds 350,268 329,164 21,104 Total commercial commitments $ 476,754 $ 418,962 $ 49,692 $ $ 8,100 $ $ 45 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. Critical accounting policies and estimates that most significantly impact our consolidated financial statements are described below. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which we hold a controlling financial interest. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance for noncontrolling interests in December 2007, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as an unconsolidated investment, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements, the guidance requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest. We adopted the provisions of the FASB guidance on January 1, 2009 and applied the provisions retrospectively, with no material impact. Our 2010 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of two 50 percent joint ventures where we hold a variable interest as defined under FASB codification where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Amounts related to these two joint ventures at December 31, 2010, include the combined carrying amount of the drillships owned by the joint ventures of $869 million and total outstanding debt of $691 million, which excludes $72 million of joint venture partner notes. Our portion of these joint venture partner notes, which totaled $36 million, has been eliminated in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying value may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $3.6 billion and $2.3 billion of construction in progress, respectively. Such amounts are included in Drilling equipment and facilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. Drilling equipment and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as of the date placed in service or date of major refurbishment. Estimated useful lives of our drilling equipment range from three to thirty years. Other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to thirty years. Interest is capitalized on construction in progress at the interest rate on debt incurred for construction or at the weighted average cost of debt outstanding during the period of construction. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $83 million, $55 million and $48 million, respectively. Overhauls and scheduled maintenance of equipment are performed based on the number of hours operated in accordance with our preventative maintenance program. Routine repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred; however, the costs of the overhauls and scheduled major maintenance projects that benefit future periods and which typically occur every three to five years are deferred when incurred and amortized over an equivalent period. The deferred portion of these major maintenance projects is included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts totaled $183 million and $181 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Amortization of deferred costs for major maintenance projects is reflected in Depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount of such amortization was $107 million, $102 million and $91 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total repair and maintenance expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, exclusive of amortization of deferred costs for major maintenance projects, was $186 million, $175 million and $169 million, respectively. 46 Table of Contents In addition to our annual review of impairment which occurs during the fourth quarter each year, we evaluate the realization of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating the need for impairment we utilize a number of methodologies in the valuation of our rigs including utilizing both a market based and a modified income based approach. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when both the market based approach and the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value. In May 2009, our jackup the Noble David Tinsley experienced a punch through while the rig was being positioned on location offshore Qatar. The incident involved the sudden penetration of all three legs through the sea bottom, which resulted in severe damage to the legs and the rig. We recorded a charge of $17 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 related to this involuntary conversion, which includes approximately $9 million for the write off of the damaged legs. During the first quarter of 2009, we recognized a charge of $12 million related to the Noble Fri Rodli, a submersible that has been cold stacked since October 2007. We recorded the charge as a result of a decision to evaluate disposition alternatives for this rig. Insurance Reserves We maintain various levels of self insured retention for certain losses including property damage, loss of hire, employment practices liability, employers liability, and general liability, among others. We accrue for property damage and loss of hire charges on a per event basis. Employment practices liability claims are accrued based on actual claims during the year. Maritime employers liability claims are generally estimated using actuarial determinations. General liability claims are estimated by our internal claims department by evaluating the facts and circumstances of each claim (including incurred but not reported claims) and making estimates based upon historical experience with similar claims. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, loss reserves for personal injury and protection claims totaled $21 million and $23 million, respectively, and such amounts are included in Other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue Recognition Revenues generated from our dayrate basis drilling contracts and labor contracts are recognized as services are performed. We may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment and personnel. Mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a drilling unit from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract. Costs incurred to relocate drilling units to more promising geographic areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. Lump sum payments received from customers relating to specific contracts, including equipment modifications, are deferred and amortized to income over the term of the drilling contract. Deferred revenues under drilling contracts totaled $104 million and $32 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such amounts are included in either Other Current Liabilities or Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition. Consistent with FASB pronouncements, we record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses. Reimbursements for loss of hire under our insurance coverages are included in (Gain)/loss on assets disposal/involuntary conversion, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 47 Table of Contents Income Taxes We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world including the United States. Income taxes have been provided based on the laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted or in which we or our subsidiaries are considered resident for income tax purposes. The income and withholding tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary significantly for each jurisdiction. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the U.S., Switzerland or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or is resident. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities do not agree with our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations, this could have a material adverse effect on us, including the imposition of a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions. Our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations and income fluctuates in the different taxing jurisdictions. As required by law, we file tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are currently undergoing examinations in a number of jurisdictions for various fiscal years. We review our liabilities and tax exposure on an ongoing basis and, to the extent audits, settlements or other events cause us to adjust the prior period liabilities, we recognize such adjustments in the period of the event. We do not believe it is possible to reasonably project the impact of current or future examinations. Any settlement is based on a number of factors, which include among others, the amount asserted by the tax authorities, their willingness to negotiate and settle through their administrative process, the impartiality of their courts and the ability to offset such tax changes in other countries. We maintain liabilities for potential tax exposures in our areas of operations and any provision or benefit resulting from changes to such liabilities are included in our tax provision along with related penalties and interest as applicable. Tax exposures include potential challenges to our intercompany transaction pricing methods, withholding tax rates, deductibility of operating and intercompany expenses and restructuring transactions. These exposures are typically resolved through audit settlements or through judicial means but can also be affected by changes in tax laws or other factors, which cause us to revise prior estimates. In addition, we may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed and it may be difficult to obtain adequate professional advice. Applicable income and withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries. We do not intend to repatriate such undistributed earnings for the foreseeable future except for distributions upon which incremental income and withholding taxes would not be material. In certain jurisdictions we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. Judgment and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially utilized. When we estimate that all or some portion of certain deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount ascertained to be unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for future utilization of our deferred assets. Any change in the ability to utilize such deferred assets will be accounted for in the period of the event affecting the valuation allowance. If facts and circumstances cause us to change our expectations regarding future tax consequences, the resulting adjustments could have a material effect on our financial results or cash flow. In certain circumstances, we expect that, due to changing demands of the offshore drilling markets and the ability to redeploy our offshore drilling units, certain of such units will not reside in a location long enough to give rise to future tax consequences. As a result, no deferred tax asset or liability has been recognized in these circumstances. Should our expectations change regarding the length of time an offshore drilling unit will be used in a given location, we will adjust deferred taxes accordingly. Certain Significant Estimates and Contingent Liabilities The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are involved in several litigation matters, some of which could lead to potential liability to us. We follow FASB standards regarding contingent liabilities which are discussed in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 48 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance which expanded disclosures that a reporting entity provides about transfers of financial assets and their effect on the financial statements. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures. Also in June 2009, the FASB issued guidance that revises how an entity evaluates variable interest entities. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures. In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance that impacts the recognition of revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements. The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The goal of this guidance is to clarify disclosures related to multiple deliverable arrangements and to align the accounting with the underlying economics of the multiple deliverable transaction. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We do not believe this guidance will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance relating to the disclosure of the fair value of assets. This guidance calls for additional information to be given regarding the transfer of items in and out of respective categories. In addition, it requires additional disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of assets that are classified as level three within the FASB fair value hierarchy. This guidance is generally effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2009. However, the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level three fair value measurements are deferred until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. These additional disclosures did not have and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures. In February 2010, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the disclosure of subsequent events for SEC registrants. Under this guidance an SEC registrant can disclose that the company has considered subsequent events through the date of filing with the SEC as opposed to specifically stating the date to which subsequent events were considered. This guidance is effective upon the issuance of the guidance. Our adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures. In April 2010, the FASB issued guidance that codifies the need for disclosure relating to the disallowance of various credits as a result of the passage of both the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which were signed into law in March 2010. The passage of these acts did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures. In December 2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires a public entity to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period. The disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period. If comparative financial statements are presented, the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the current year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures. 49 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates or equity prices, as further described below. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is at an agreed upon percentage point spread over LIBOR, or a base rate stated in the agreement. At December 31, 2010, we had $40 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. As part of the Frontier acquisition, we acquired an interest in the two Bully joint ventures with Shell. These joint ventures maintain interest rate swaps which are classified as cash flow hedges. The interest rate swaps relate to debt for the construction of the two Bully class rigs undertaken by the two joint ventures, and the hedges are designed to fix the cash paid for interest on these projects. The purpose of these hedges is to satisfy bank covenants and to limit exposure to changes in interest rates. There are no credit risk related contingency features embedded in these swap agreements. The aggregate notional amounts of the interest rate swaps totaled $604 million as of December 31, 2010. The notional amounts and settlement dates for the Bully 1 are $278 million, with $47 million settling June 30, 2011 and the remainder settling quarterly, with the final amounts settling in December 2014. The notional amount and settlement dates for the Bully 2 interest rate swap is $326 million which settles quarterly, with the final amount settling in January 2018. The carrying amount of these interest rate swaps was $27 million which includes $31 million included in liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation for the Frontier acquisition and $0.4 million of unrealized gains included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2010 in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A one percent change in the LIBOR rate would result in approximately an additional $1 million of interest charges per year. In February 2011, the outstanding balances of the Bully 1 and Bully 2 credit facilities, which totaled $691 million, were repaid in full and the credit facilities terminated. In addition, the related interest rate swaps were settled and terminated concurrent with the repayment and termination of the credit facilities. We maintain certain debt instruments at a fixed rate whose fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and market perceptions of our credit risk. The fair value of our total debt was $2.9 billion and $839 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase was a result of our issuance of $1.25 billion in debt, the assumption of $689 million of debt in the Frontier acquisition, the issuance of $40 million in our revolving credit facility, and the issuance of $36 million of joint venture partner debt, coupled with changes in fair value related to changes in interest rates and market perceptions of our credit risk. Foreign Currency Risk As a multinational company, we conduct business in approximately 16 countries. Our functional currency is primarily the U.S. Dollar, which is consistent with the oil and gas industry. However, outside the United States, a portion of our expenses are incurred in local currencies. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the currencies of the countries in which we operate, our expenses reported in U.S. Dollars will increase (decrease). We are exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that local currency expenses exceed revenues denominated in local currency that are other than the functional currency. To help manage this potential risk, we periodically enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and we may conduct hedging activities in future periods to mitigate such exposure. These contracts are primarily accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedged item is recorded directly to earnings. We have documented policies and procedures to monitor and control the use of derivative instruments. We do not engage in derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives; however, we do maintain certain derivatives which were not designated for hedge accounting under FASB standards. 50 Table of Contents Our North Sea and Brazil operations have a significant amount of their cash operating expenses payable in local currencies. To limit the potential risk of currency fluctuations, we typically maintain short term forward contracts settling monthly in their respective local currencies to mitigate exchange exposure. The forward contract settlements in 2011 represent approximately 20 percent of these forecasted local currency requirements. The notional amount of the forward contracts outstanding, expressed in U.S. Dollars, was approximately $53 million at December 31, 2010. Total unrealized gains related to these forward contracts were $2 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and were recorded as part of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A ten percent change in the exchange rate for the local currencies would change the fair value of these forward contracts by approximately $5 million. We have entered into a firm commitment for the construction of our Noble Globetrotter I drillship. The drillship will be constructed in two phases, with the second phase being installation and commissioning of the topside equipment. Our payment obligation for this second phase of construction is denominated in Euros, and in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we entered into forward contracts to purchase Euros. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate notional amount of the remaining forward contracts was 30 million Euros. Each forward contract settles in connection with required payments under the contract. We are accounting for these forward contracts as fair value hedges. The fair market value of these derivative instruments is included in Other current assets/liabilities or Other assets/liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on when the forward contract is expected to be settled. Gains and losses from these fair value hedges are recognized in earnings currently along with the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The fair market value of these outstanding forward contracts, which are included in Other current assets/liabilities and Other assets/liabilities, totaled approximately $3 million at December 31, 2010 and $0.8 million at December 31, 2009. A ten percent change in the exchange rate for the Euro would change the fair value of these forward contracts by approximately $4 million. The Bully 2 joint venture maintained foreign exchange forward contracts to help mitigate the risk of currency fluctuation of the Singapore Dollar for the construction of the Bully II vessel taking place in a Singapore shipyard. The notional amount on these contracts totaled approximately $31 million as of December 31, 2010. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FASB standards and therefore changes in fair values are recognized as either income or loss in our consolidated income statement. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we have recognized a gain of $2 million related to these foreign exchange forward contracts. A ten percent change in the exchange rate for the local currencies would change the fair value of these forward contracts and impact net income by approximately $3 million. Market Risk We sponsor the Noble Drilling Corporation 401(k) Savings Restoration Plan (Restoration Plan). The Restoration Plan is a nonqualified, unfunded employee benefit plan under which certain highly compensated employees may elect to defer compensation in excess of amounts deferrable under our 401(k) savings plan. The Restoration Plan has no assets, and amounts withheld for the Restoration Plan are kept by us for general corporate purposes. The investments selected by employees and the associated returns are tracked on a phantom basis. Accordingly, we have a liability to employees for amounts originally withheld plus phantom investment income or less phantom investment losses. We are at risk for phantom investment income and, conversely, benefit should phantom investment losses occur. At December 31, 2010, our liability under the Restoration Plan totaled $7 million. We have purchased investments that closely correlate to the investment elections made by participants in the Restoration Plan in order to mitigate the impact of the phantom investment income and losses on our consolidated financial statements. The value of these investments held for our benefit totaled $7 million at December 31, 2010. A ten percent change in the fair value of the phantom investments would change our liability by approximately $0.7 million. Any change in the fair value of the phantom investments would be mitigated by a change in the investments held for our benefit. 51 Table of Contents We also have a U.S. noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers certain salaried employees and a U.S. noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers certain hourly employees, whose initial date of employment is prior to August 1, 2004 (collectively referred to as our qualified U.S. plans). These plans are governed by the Noble Drilling Corporation Retirement Trust (the Trust). The benefits from these plans are based primarily on years of service and, for the salaried plan, employees compensation near retirement. These plans are designed to qualify under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and our funding policy is consistent with funding requirements of ERISA and other applicable laws and regulations. We make cash contributions, or utilize credits available to us, for the qualified U.S. plans when required. The benefit amount that can be covered by the qualified U.S. plans is limited under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) of 1986. Therefore, we maintain an unfunded, nonqualified excess benefit plan designed to maintain benefits for all employees at the formula level in the qualified U.S. plans. We refer to the qualified U.S. plans and the excess benefit plan collectively as the U.S. plans. In addition to the U.S. plans, each of Noble Drilling (Land Support) Limited, Noble Enterprises Limited and Noble Drilling (Nederland) B.V., all indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of Noble Swiss, maintains a pension plan that covers all of its salaried, non union employees (collectively referred to as our non U.S. plans). Benefits are based on credited service and employees compensation near retirement, as defined by the plans. Changes in market asset value related to the pension plans noted above could have a material impact upon our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and could result in material cash expenditures in future periods. 52 Table of Contents
