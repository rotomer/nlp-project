Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2011. You should read the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes in conjunction with this discussion. Executive Overview Our 2011 financial and operating results include: operating revenues totaling $2.7 billion; net income of $371 million or $1.46 per diluted share; net cash from operating activities totaling $759 million; and an increase in debt to 33.5 percent of total capitalization at the end of 2011, up from 27.5 percent at the end of 2010 due to the issuance of $1.1 billion in senior notes and $935 million additional debt being drawn on our credit facilities. During 2011, we began to see some stability in the offshore drilling market after a period of volatility which occurred following the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010 and the U.S. governmental response to the incident. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the granting of permits and publication of new safety rules has led to more stable activity levels within the industry, especially as it relates to the deepwater markets. This resumption of activity has led to greater investment within the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is contributing to an improvement in dayrates for deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs worldwide. While there are still risks, including potential third party environmental lawsuits targeting the permitting process, possible new drilling regulations, a failure of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) to issue permits in a timely manner and the adoption by individual operators of new drilling or equipment standards exceeding those required by regulatory bodies, we believe those risks will be reduced as long as rigs continue to work without incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The offshore drilling market displayed indications of improvement during 2011 even though there continues to be uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the global economic recovery, which is proceeding unevenly in different geographic regions. In addition to the political instability in certain oil producing nations in the Middle East and North Africa, there is also uncertainty regarding recovery in the credit markets, particularly in Europe and North America. During 2011, oil prices fluctuated as a result of supply side concerns in response to political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. Natural gas prices in the United States fluctuated during the year, and ended the year at historical lows. We believe there continues to be competing factors which could impact the volatility in the offshore drilling market and the prices of oil and gas commodities for the foreseeable future. Despite the instability in the global economy noted above, we saw an increase in demand for offshore drilling services in 2011. We believe both the short term and long term outlook for the deepwater market continues to strengthen. Market dayrates for new ultra deepwater units remain generally above $500,000, which is lower than the peak rates achieved in 2007 and 2008, but higher than rates seen in 2010. Short term fixtures for very high specification units have exceeded $550,000, and we believe this is an indication of where the market could be going should there continue to be a strong demand for ultra deepwater drilling units. Although demand for jackup units decreased slightly during 2010, utilization rates for such units stabilized in 2011, especially for those units equipped with standard drilling features. We continue to see differentiation in the jackup market with newer units having utilization rates and dayrates exceeding those units that entered service before 2000, as customers display a preference for technologically advanced and efficient drilling alternatives. Demand for our drilling services generally depends on a variety of economic and political factors, including worldwide demand for oil and gas, the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and pricing, the level of production of non OPEC countries and the policies of various governments regarding access to their oil and gas reserves. Our results of operations depend on offshore drilling activity worldwide. Historically, oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices have significantly affected that level of activity. Generally, higher oil and natural gas prices, or our customers expectations of higher prices, result in greater demand for our services and lower oil and gas prices result in reduced demand for our services. Demand for our services is also a function of the worldwide supply of mobile offshore drilling units. Industry analysts widely report that a significant expansion of industry supply of both jackups and ultra deepwater units is underway. The introduction of additional non contracted rigs into the marketplace could have an adverse effect on demand for our services or the dayrates we are able to achieve. 27 Table of Contents As a result of exploration discoveries offshore Brazil, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), the Brazilian national oil company, recently announced that it had approved contracts with two contractors to lease a total of 26 drilling rigs, which are expected to be delivered in the next 48 to 90 months. The potential increase in supply from the Petrobras newbuilds could adversely impact overall industry dayrates and economics. As of February 15, 2012, we have 10 rigs under contract in Mexico with Pemex Exploracion y Produccion (Pemex), and three of these rigs have contracts scheduled to expire in 2012. Pemex continues to tender for additional jackup rigs as it attempts to increase the number of working rigs. Some previous tenders published by Pemex contained a requirement that certain units must have entered service since the year 2000. While Pemex did not succeed in securing a significant number of newer rigs from those published tenders, we cannot predict whether this age requirement will be present in future Pemex tenders. If this requirement is present in future tenders, it could require us to seek work for our rigs in other locations, as the ages of a majority of our rigs currently operating in Mexico do not meet this requirement. If such work is not available, it could lead to additional idle time on some of our rigs. We cannot predict how many rigs might be affected or how long they could remain idle. We remain optimistic that many, if not all, of our rigs currently operating in Mexico will be able to continue to secure long term work with Pemex. In January 2011, we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Petrobras regarding operations in Brazil. Under the terms of the MOU, we agreed to substitute the Noble Phoenix, then under contract with Shell in Southeast Asia, for the Noble Muravlenko. In connection with the cancellation of the contract on the Noble Phoenix, we recognized a non cash gain of approximately $52.5 million during the first quarter of 2011, which represents the unamortized fair value of the in place contract assumed in connection with the Frontier acquisition. As a result of the substitution, we reached a decision not to proceed with the previously announced reliability upgrade to the Noble Muravlenko that was scheduled to take place in 2013. As a result, we incurred a non cash charge of approximately $32.6 million related to the termination of outstanding shipyard contracts. We expect the actual substitution to take place in the second quarter of 2012 after the Noble Phoenix completes its shipyard work. In connection with our existing drilling contracts with Petrobras for two of our drillships operating in Brazil, we approved certain shipyard reliability upgrade projects for these drillships, the Noble Leo Segerius and the Noble Roger Eason. These upgrade projects, planned through 2012, are designed to enhance the reliability and operational performance of these drillships. During the first quarter of 2012, the Noble Leo Segerius completed the shipyard portion of its reliability upgrade and departed the shipyard in Brazil for seatrials, final commissioning and customer acceptance activities. The Noble Leo Segerius is currently scheduled to return to work in the first quarter of 2012. The Noble Roger Eason is expected to enter the shipyard for its reliability upgrade in the second quarter of 2012, which is expected to take approximately 270 days to complete. There are a number of risks associated with shipyard projects of this nature, particularly in Brazil, including potential project delays and cost overruns because of labor, customs, local shipyard, local content and other issues. In addition, the drilling contracts for these vessels provide Petrobras with certain rights of termination in the event of excessive downtime, and it is possible that Petrobras could exercise this right in the future with respect to one or both of these drillships. We intend to continue to closely monitor and discuss with Petrobras the status of these projects and plan to take appropriate steps to mitigate identified risks, which depending upon the circumstances, could involve a variety of options. While we cannot predict the future level of demand or dayrates for our drilling services or future conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, we continue to believe we are well positioned within the industry and believe our acquisition of Frontier and recent newbuild activity further strengthens our position, especially in deepwater drilling. Our business strategy focuses on the active expansion of our worldwide deepwater capabilities through construction, upgrades and modifications, acquisitions and divestitures of drilling units, as well as the deployment of our drilling assets in important oil and gas producing areas. We have actively expanded our offshore drilling and deepwater capabilities in recent years through the construction and acquisition of new rigs. As part of this technical and operational enhancement, we plan to continue pursuing opportunities to upgrade our fleet to achieve greater technological capability, which should increase our operational efficiencies. 28 Table of Contents As part of this process, we may dispose of some or all of our lower specification units and related assets and operations in one or more transactions. These dispositions may include sales of assets to third parties, a spin off or other distribution or separation of assets. In analyzing any disposition, we will consider the strategic benefit to us of the potential transaction while seeking to secure what we consider appropriate value. To date, no potential disposition has provided the results we seek. The drilling market for lower specification units has recently improved, and we have experienced increased utilization and dayrates for these assets in certain areas. Thus, while we continue to evaluate disposition options, we believe these units should provide a positive contribution to our overall results under current market conditions. We can provide no assurance as to whether any disposition transaction will occur or what form it may take. During 2011, we continued our newbuild program as indicated by the following activities: we completed construction on the Noble Bully I, a dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment drillship, owned through a joint venture with a subsidiary of Shell, that left the shipyard during the third quarter of 2011 and is scheduled to complete acceptance testing and begin operations under a long term contract in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter of 2012; we completed construction on the Noble Bully II, a dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment drillship, owned through a joint venture with a subsidiary of Shell, that left the shipyard during the fourth quarter of 2011 and is scheduled to complete acceptance testing and begin operations under a long term contract in Brazil during the first quarter of 2012; we completed construction on one dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment Globetrotter class drillship that left the shipyard during the fourth quarter of 2011 and is scheduled to complete acceptance testing and begin operations under a long term contract in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the second quarter of 2012; we continued construction on a second dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment Globetrotter class drillship, which is scheduled to be delivered to our customer in the fourth quarter of 2013; we began construction on four dynamically positioned, ultra deepwater, harsh environment drillships at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (HHI), which are estimated to be delivered from the shipyard to begin acceptance testing beginning in the second quarter of 2013; and we began construction on six high specification heavy duty, harsh environment jackup rigs, which are estimated to be delivered from the shipyard to begin acceptance testing beginning in the first quarter of 2013. Capital expenditures, including expenditures related to items noted above, totaled $2.6 billion during 2011. 29 Table of Contents Contract Drilling Services Backlog We maintain a backlog (as defined below) of commitments for contract drilling services. The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2011 the amount of our contract drilling services backlog and the percent of available operating days committed for the periods indicated: Year Ending December 31, Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2023 (In millions) Contract Drilling Services Backlog Semisubmersibles/Drillships (1) (4) (5) $ 11,679 $ 2,079 $ 2,006 $ 2,038 $ 1,276 $ 4,280 Jackups 2,004 1,071 570 309 47 7 Total (2) $ 13,683 $ 3,150 $ 2,576 $ 2,347 $ 1,323 $ 4,287 Percent of Available Operating Days Committed (3) 68 % 44 % 31 % 12 % 5 % (1) Our drilling contracts with Petrobras provide an opportunity for us to earn performance bonuses based on downtime experienced for our rigs operating offshore Brazil. With respect to our semisubmersibles operating offshore Brazil for Petrobras, we have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of potential performance bonuses for such semisubmersibles, which amount is based on and generally consistent with our historical earnings of performance bonuses for these rigs. With respect to our drillships presently operating offshore Brazil for Petrobras, we (a) have not included in our backlog any performance bonuses for periods prior to certain upgrade projects scheduled for completion in 2012 and 2013, which projects are designed to enhance the reliability and operational performance of these drillships, and (b) have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of potential performance bonuses for periods after the estimated completion of such upgrade projects. Our backlog for semisubmersibles/drillships includes approximately $250 million attributable to these performance bonuses. The drilling contracts with Shell for the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II, Noble Jim Thompson, Noble Jim Day and Noble Clyde Boudreaux, as well as the letter of intent for the HHI Drillship I, provide opportunities for us to earn performance bonuses based on key performance indicators as defined by Shell. With respect to these contracts, we have included in our backlog an amount equal to 75 percent of the potential performance bonuses for these rigs, except for the Noble Clyde Boudreaux while working in Brazil, where limited bonus is expected. Our backlog for these rigs includes approximately $520 million attributable to these performance bonuses. (2) Pemex has the ability to cancel its drilling contracts on 30 days or less notice without Pemexs making an early termination payment. At December 31, 2011 we had 10 rigs contracted to Pemex in Mexico and our backlog includes approximately $687 million related to such contracts. Also, our drilling contracts generally provide the customer an early termination right in the event we fail to meet certain performance standards, including downtime thresholds. For example, Petrobras has the right to terminate its contract in the event of excessive downtime. While we have recently exceeded downtime thresholds on the Noble Dave Beard and Noble Paul Wolff, we have not received any notification concerning contract cancellations nor do we anticipate receiving any such notifications. (3) Percentages take into account additional capacity from the estimated dates of deployment of our newbuild rigs that are scheduled to commence operations during 2012 through 2015. (4) It is not possible to accurately determine the impact to our revenues or backlog resulting from efforts by operators to cancel or modify drilling contracts due to U.S. government imposed restrictions and the delay in the issuance of new drilling permits, and other consequences of actions by the U.S. government. At December 31, 2011, backlog related to our U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater rigs totaled $5.4 billion, $865 million of which represents backlog for the year ending December 31, 2012. We entered into an agreement with Shell, effective June 27, 2010, which provides that Shell may suspend the contracts on three of our units operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during any period of regulatory restriction by paying reduced suspension dayrates in lieu of the normal operating dayrates. The term of the initial contract is also extended by the suspension period. The impact of this agreement is to shift backlog among periods with an immaterial increase to total backlog because of the reduced suspension rates. (5) Noble and a subsidiary of Shell are involved in joint ventures to build, operate, and own both the Noble Bully I and the Noble Bully II. Under the terms of the joint venture agreements, each party has an equal 50 percent share in both vessels. As of December 31, 2011, the combined amount of backlog for these rigs totals $2.5 billion, all of which is included in backlog. Nobles 50 percent interest in the backlog for these rigs totals $1.3 billion. 30 Table of Contents Our contract drilling services backlog reported above reflects estimated future revenues attributable to both signed drilling contracts and letters of intent that we expect to become firm. A letter of intent is generally subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive drilling contract. It is possible that some customers that have entered into letters of intent will not enter into signed drilling contracts. We calculate backlog for any given unit and period by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate for such unit by the number of days remaining in the period. The reported contract drilling services backlog does not include amounts representing revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling services revenues, amounts constituting reimbursables from customers or amounts attributable to uncommitted option periods under drilling contracts or letters of intent. The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may be different than the backlog amounts and backlog periods set forth in the table above due to various factors, including, but not limited to, shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime, weather conditions and other factors that result in applicable dayrates lower than the full contractual operating dayrate. In addition, amounts included in the backlog may change because drilling contracts may be varied or modified by mutual consent or customers may exercise early termination rights contained in some of our drilling contracts or decline to enter into a drilling contract after executing a letter of intent. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for the periods for which the backlog is calculated. Nigerian Operations In 2007, we began and voluntarily contacted the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to advise them of an internal investigation of the legality under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and local laws of certain reimbursement payments made by our Nigerian affiliate to our customs agents in Nigeria. In 2010, we finalized settlements of this matter with each of the SEC and the DOJ. Pursuant to these settlements, we agreed to pay fines and penalties to the DOJ and the SEC and to certain undertakings, including refraining from violating the FCPA and other anti corruption laws, self reporting any violations of the FCPA or such laws to the DOJ and reporting to the DOJ on an annual basis our progress on anti corruption compliance matters. Our ability to comply with the terms of the settlements is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents and supervise, train and retain competent employees, and the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our code of business conduct and ethics. In January 2011, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Nigerian Attorney General Office initiated an investigation into these same activities. A subsidiary of Noble Swiss resolved this matter through the execution of a non prosecution agreement dated January 28, 2011. Pursuant to this agreement, the subsidiary paid $2.5 million to resolve all charges and claims of the Nigerian government. Any additional investigation by these or other agencies could damage our reputation and result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, resolving any additional investigations could be expensive and consume significant time and attention of our senior management. All of our rigs operating in Nigeria are operating under temporary import permits. To date, we have been successful in obtaining new, or extending existing, temporary import permits. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new permits or further extensions of permits necessary to continue the operation of our rigs in Nigeria. If we cannot obtain a new permit or an extension necessary to continue operations of any rig, we may need to cease operations under the drilling contract for such rig and relocate such rig from Nigerian waters. We cannot predict what impact these events may have on any such contract or our business in Nigeria, and we could face additional fines and sanctions in Nigeria. Furthermore, we cannot predict what changes, if any, relating to temporary import permit policies and procedures may be established or implemented in Nigeria in the future, or how any such changes may impact our business there. In April 2010, the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Bill was signed into law. The law is designed to create Nigerian content in operations and transactions within the Nigerian oil and gas industry. The law sets forth certain requirements for the utilization of Nigerian human resources and goods and services in oil and gas projects and creates a Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board to implement and monitor the law and develop regulations pursuant to the law. The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board has indicated that it will require all non Nigerian offshore drilling companies to reorganize their local operations to include Nigerian indigenous minority interests in the operating assets and to obtain the approval of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board for future work in Nigeria. The law also establishes a Nigerian Content Development Fund to fund the implementation of the law, and requires that one percent of the value of every contract awarded in the Nigerian oil and gas industry be paid into the fund. We cannot predict what impact the new law may have on our existing or future operations in Nigeria, but the effect on our operations there could be significant. 31 Table of Contents Acquisition of Frontier Holdings Limited On July 28, 2010, Noble Swiss and Noble AM Merger Co., a Cayman Islands company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Swiss (Merger Sub), completed the acquisition of FDR Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands company (Frontier). Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Frontier and certain of Frontiers shareholders, Merger Sub merged with and into Frontier, with Frontier surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Swiss and a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Cayman. The Frontier acquisition was for a purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion in cash plus liabilities assumed and strategically expanded and enhanced our global fleet. Frontiers results of operations were included in our results beginning July 28, 2010. We funded the cash consideration paid at closing of approximately $1.7 billion using proceeds from our July 2010 offering of senior notes and existing cash on hand. Consummation of Migration and Internal Restructuring On March 26, 2009, we completed a series of transactions that effectively changed the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland. As a result of these transactions, Noble Cayman, our former publicly traded parent company, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Swiss, our current publicly traded parent company. Noble Swiss principal asset is all of the shares of Noble Cayman. Noble Cayman has no public equity outstanding after March 26, 2009. The consolidated financial statements of Noble Swiss include the accounts of Noble Cayman, and Noble Swiss conducts substantially all of its business through Noble Cayman and its subsidiaries. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 Compared to 2010 General Net income attributable to Noble Corporation for 2011 was $371 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $2.7 billion, compared to net income for 2010 of $773 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $2.8 billion. The consolidated financial statements of Noble Swiss include the accounts of Noble Cayman, and Noble Swiss conducts substantially all of its business through Noble Cayman and its subsidiaries. As a result, the financial position and results of operations for Noble Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2011 and 2010, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble Swiss in all material respects, except operating income for Noble Cayman for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $49 million higher than operating income for Noble Swiss for the same period, primarily as a result of costs directly attributable to Noble Swiss for operations support and stewardship related services. 32 Table of Contents Rig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates Operating revenues and operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): Average Rig Operating Average Utilization (1) Days (2) Dayrates 2011 2010 2011 2010 % Change 2011 2010 % Change Jackups 75 % 79 % 11,794 12,376 5 % $ 85,510 $ 96,935 12 % Semisubmersibles 82 % 86 % 4,176 3,837 9 % 296,331 288,163 3 % Drillships 59 % 89 % 1,284 1,392 8 % 242,019 256,067 5 % Other 0 % 11 % 95 100 % 355,986 100 % Total 72 % 78 % 17,254 17,700 3 % $ 148,185 $ 152,292 3 % (1) Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of actively marketed rigs in our fleet excluding newbuild rigs under construction. (2) Information reflects the number of days that our rigs were operating under contract. Contract Drilling Services The following table sets forth the operating revenues and the operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment for 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): Change 2011 2010 $ % Operating revenues: Contract drilling services $ 2,556,758 $ 2,695,493 $ (138,735 ) 5 % Reimbursables (1) 77,278 73,959 3,319 4 % Other 875 2,332 (1,457 ) 62 % $ 2,634,911 $ 2,771,784 $ (136,873 ) 5 % Operating costs and expenses: Contract drilling services $ 1,384,200 $ 1,177,800 $ 206,400 18 % Reimbursables (1) 56,589 56,674 (85 ) 0 % Depreciation and amortization 647,142 528,011 119,131 23 % Selling, general and administrative 90,262 91,094 (832 ) 1 % Gain on contract extinguishments, net (21,202 ) (21,202 ) ** 2,156,991 1,853,579 303,412 16 % Operating income $ 477,920 $ 918,205 $ (440,285 ) 48 % (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as operating revenues and the related direct costs as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues. Decreased contract drilling services revenues for the current year as compared to the prior year was driven by reductions in both average dayrates and operating days. The three percent decrease in average dayrates reduced revenues by approximately $71 million, and the three percent decrease in operating days decreased revenues by an additional $68 million. The decrease in contract drilling services revenues primarily relates to our jackups, drillships and FPSO, which generated approximately $191 million, $46 million and $34 million less revenue, respectively, in 2011. The decrease in jackup average dayrates of 12 percent resulted in a $135 million decrease in revenues from the prior year. The reduction in average dayrates was primarily from the contractual repricing of rigs in the Middle East, the North Sea, and Mexico for changes in market conditions in the global shallow water market. The five percent decline in jackup operating days resulted in a $56 million decline in revenues. The decrease in utilization primarily related to rigs coming off contract in Mexico and the Middle East during 2011, the majority of which did not return to work until the latter part of the year. 33 Table of Contents The decrease in drillship revenue was primarily driven by reduced dayrates of five percent and an eight percent decrease in operating days, which resulted in decreased revenues of $18 million and $28 million, respectively, from the prior year. The decrease in drillship revenue is primarily the result of increased downtime in Brazil, as rigs entered the shipyard for upgrades and repairs. Revenue from our FPSO, the Noble Seillean, decreased $34 million as it was not under contract in 2011. The decreases in revenue for the above rig classes were partially offset by an increase in revenue of $132 million from our semisubmersibles. The increase was primarily attributable to a nine percent increase in operating days and three percent increase in average dayrates, which contributed additional revenue in 2011 of $98 million and $34 million, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to operations from the newbuilds, Noble Dave Beard and Noble Jim Day, which were added to the fleet in March 2010 and January 2011, respectively. Additionally, the Noble Driller was added to the fleet in July 2010 as part of the Frontier acquisition. Operating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses increased $206 million for the current year as compared to the prior year. The rigs added to the fleet as part of the Frontier acquisition and the Noble Dave Beard and the Noble Jim Day added approximately $120 million of operating costs in the current year. Excluding the additional expenses related to these rigs, our contract drilling costs increased $86 million in the current year from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a $22 million increase in maintenance and rig related expenses, $20 million increase in mobilization costs, $18 million increase in labor costs, and an $11 million increase in safety and training costs. These cost increases were primarily for our rigs returning, or preparing to return, to work in Brazil and Mexico. Additionally, rotation costs and operations support costs increased $10 million and $5 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased $119 million in 2011 over 2010 as a result of depreciation on newbuilds placed into service, rigs added to the fleet as part of the Frontier acquisition and additional depreciation related to other capital expenditures on our fleet since the beginning of 2010. Other The following table sets forth the operating revenues and the operating costs and expenses for our other services for 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): Change 2011 2010 $ % Operating revenues: Labor contract drilling services $ 59,004 $ 32,520 $ 26,484 81 % Reimbursables (1) 1,917 2,872 (955 ) 33 % $ 60,921 $ 35,392 $ 25,529 72 % Operating costs and expenses: Labor contract drilling services $ 33,885 $ 22,056 $ 11,829 54 % Reimbursables (1) 1,850 2,740 (890 ) 32 % Depreciation and amortization 11,498 11,818 (320 ) 3 % Selling, general and administrative 1,115 903 212 23 % 48,348 37,517 10,831 29 % Operating income $ 12,573 $ (2,125 ) $ 14,698 692 % (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as operating revenues and the related direct costs as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents Operating Revenues and Costs and Expenses. The increase in both revenue and expense primarily relates to the commencement of a refurbishment project with our customer, Shell, for one of its rigs to be operated under a labor contract in Alaska, combined with operational increases and foreign currency fluctuations in our Canadian operations. Other Income and Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses were consistent with 2010 as a $6 million increase primarily related to ongoing legal and tax expenses in the current year was offset by a $6 million decrease resulting from the absence of costs related to our completed FCPA investigation in the prior year. Interest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, increased $46 million in 2011 from 2010. The increase is a result of $1.25 billion of debt issued in July 2010, which was used to partially fund the Frontier acquisition, $1.1 billion of debt issued in February 2011, which was primarily used to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and to repay our portion of outstanding debt under the joint venture credit facilities, and current year drawdowns on the credit facilities. Income Tax Provision. Our income tax provision decreased $70 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a reduction in pre tax earnings, which was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Pre tax earnings decreased approximately 52 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 resulting in a reduction of approximately $75 million in income tax expense. The higher effective tax rate, which was 16.7 percent in 2011 compared to 15.6 percent in 2010, increased income tax expense by approximately $5 million. The increase in the effective tax rate was a result of a change in our geographic revenue mix primarily resulting from drilling restrictions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by the resolution of discrete tax items. 2010 Compared to 2009 General Net income attributable to Noble Corporation for 2010 was $773 million, or $3.02 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $2.8 billion, compared to net income for 2009 of $1.7 billion, or $6.42 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.6 billion. The consolidated financial statements of Noble Swiss include the accounts of Noble Cayman, and Noble Swiss conducts substantially all of its business through Noble Cayman and its subsidiaries. As a result, the financial position and results of operations for Noble Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2010 and 2009, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble Swiss in all material respects, except operating income for Noble Cayman for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $42 million higher than operating income for Noble Swiss for the same period, primarily as a result of costs directly attributable to Noble Swiss for stewardship related services. 35 Table of Contents Rig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates Operating revenues and operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): Average Rig Operating Average Utilization (1) Days (2) Dayrates 2010 2009 2010 2009 % Change 2010 2009 % Change Jackups 79 % 82 % 12,376 12,719 3 % $ 96,935 $ 147,701 34 % Semisubmersibles 86 % 100 % 3,837 3,673 4 % 288,163 368,398 22 % Drillships 89 % 91 % 1,392 993 40 % 256,067 254,084 1 % FPSO/Submersibles (3) 11 % 51 % 95 418 77 % 355,986 61,711 477 % Total 78 % 84 % 17,700 17,803 1 % $ 152,292 $ 197,144 23 % (1) Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of actively marketed rigs in our fleet excluding newbuild rigs under construction.

(3) Effective March 31, 2009, the Noble Fri Rodli, which had been cold stacked since October 2007, was removed from our rig fleet. Contract Drilling Services The following table sets forth the operating revenues and the operating costs and expenses for our contract drilling services segment for 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): Change 2010 2009 $ % Operating revenues: Contract drilling services $ 2,695,493 $ 3,509,755 $ (814,262 ) 23 % Reimbursables (1) 73,959 96,161 (22,202 ) 23 % Other 2,332 1,302 1,030 79 % $ 2,771,784 $ 3,607,218 $ (835,434 ) 23 % Operating costs and expenses: Contract drilling services $ 1,177,800 $ 1,006,764 $ 171,036 17 % Reimbursables (1) 56,674 82,122 (25,448 ) 31 % Depreciation and amortization 528,011 398,572 129,439 32 % Selling, general and administrative 91,094 80,004 11,090 14 % (Gain)/Loss on asset disposal/involuntary conversion, net 31,053 (31,053 ) * * 1,853,579 1,598,515 255,064 16 % Operating income $ 918,205 $ 2,008,703 $ (1,090,498 ) 54 % (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues and the related direct costs as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage. Operating Revenues. The decrease in contract drilling services revenue for 2010 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by reductions in both average dayrates and utilization. Lower dayrates decreased revenues approximately $798 million, while fewer operating days decreased revenues by approximately $16 million. The reduction in utilization was partially offset by the acquisition of Frontier and the addition of newbuilds. The decrease in contract drilling services revenue related primarily to our jackups and semisubmersibles, which generated approximately $679 million and $248 million less revenue in 2010 as compared to the prior year, respectively. The decrease in jackup revenue was from a 34 percent decline in dayrates primarily from the contractual re pricing of rigs in the Middle East, the North Sea, and Mexico resulting from changes in market conditions in the global shallow water market. Reductions in average dayrates by 22 percent contributed to the decline in semisubmersible revenue. These reductions resulted from the drilling restrictions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico where lower standby rates replaced the standard operating dayrates for a majority of our customers, lower utilization from the termination of certain contracts and a dispute with a customer over the Noble Homer Ferrington contract. 36 Table of Contents The decreases in revenue for the above rig classes were partially offset by higher revenues from our drillships and other rigs, which increased $113 million in 2010 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the drillships and FPSO added to the fleet as part of the Frontier acquisition of $143 million, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our drillships operating in Brazil. Operating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses increased $171 million in 2010 as compared to the prior year. Our newbuild rigs, the Noble Scott Marks, Noble Danny Adkins and Noble Dave Beard, which were added to the fleet in June 2009, October 2009 and March 2010, respectively, added approximately $109 million of operating costs in 2010. The acquisition of the Frontier rigs added an additional $55 million of operating costs. Excluding the additional expenses related to these newbuild and Frontier rigs, our contract drilling costs increased $7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This change was principally due to acquisition costs of $19 million coupled with increases in safety costs of $4 million, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance expenses of $9 million and a decrease in transportation and other expenses of $7 million. Depreciation and amortization increased $129 million in 2010 over 2009 as a result of depreciation on newbuilds placed into service, and additional depreciation related to other capital expenditures on our fleet since the beginning of 2009. Also, the acquisition of Frontier added approximately $39 million in depreciation during 2010. Loss on asset disposal/involuntary conversion in 2009 primarily consists of a charge of $17 million for our jackup, the Noble David Tinsley, which experienced a punch through while being positioned on location offshore Qatar. The $17 million charge includes approximately $9 million for the write off of the damaged legs and $8 million for non reimbursable expenses. Also during 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $12 million for the Noble Fri Rodli as a result of a decision to evaluate disposition alternatives for this submersible drilling unit. Other The following table sets forth the operating revenues and the operating costs and expenses for our other services for 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): Change 2010 2009 $ % Operating revenues: Labor contract drilling services $ 32,520 $ 30,298 $ 2,222 7 % Reimbursables (1) 2,872 3,040 (168 ) 6 % Other 228 (228 ) 100 % $ 35,392 $ 33,566 $ 1,826 5 % Operating costs and expenses: Labor contract drilling services $ 22,056 $ 18,827 $ 3,229 17 % Reimbursables (1) 2,740 2,913 (173 ) 6 % Depreciation and amortization 11,818 9,741 2,077 21 % Selling, general and administrative 903 258 645 250 % (Gain)/Loss on asset disposal, net (214 ) 214 ** 37,517 31,525 5,992 19 % Operating income $ (2,125 ) $ 2,041 $ (4,166 ) 204 % (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as operating revenues and the related direct costs as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ** Not a meaningful percentage. 37 Table of Contents Operating Revenues and Costs and Expenses. Revenues and expenses associated with our Canadian labor contract drilling services increased in 2010 primarily for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates coupled with increased labor and contract drilling services costs. The increase in depreciation results from fixed asset additions in conjunction with the relocation of our corporate offices to Switzerland. Other Income and Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12 million in 2010 from 2009 primarily as a result of the FCPA settlement of $8 million, along with increases in employee related costs of $2 million, increases in consulting fees of $2 million and Swiss VAT taxes of $2 million, partially offset by the worldwide asset consolidation project and migration costs and other expenses in 2009 of $2 million. Interest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized increased $8 million in 2010 primarily for the addition of $1.25 billion of debt issued in July 2010 to partially fund the Frontier acquisition. Income Tax Provision. Our income tax provision decreased $194 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction in pre tax earnings combined with a lower effective tax rate. Pre tax earnings decreased approximately 55 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 resulting in a reduction of approximately $184 million in income tax expense. The lower effective tax rate, which was 15.6 percent in 2010 compared to 16.7 percent in 2009, reduced income tax expense by approximately $10 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Net cash from operating activities in 2011 was $759 million, which compared to $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a significant decline in net income coupled with an increase in customer receivables. The increase in customer receivables is primarily related to the increased fleet activity in 2011, delays in customer payments and certain disputed amounts, which we believe will ultimately be collected. During 2011, we entered into an additional $600 million revolving credit facility, and at December 31, 2011 we had $225 million available under our credit facilities. We had working capital of $232 million and $110 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Primarily as a result of our $1.1 billion senior notes offering in February 2011 and a $935 million increase in net borrowings on our credit facilities during the year, total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity increased to 33.5 percent at December 31, 2011 from 27.5 percent at December 31, 2010. Additionally, at December 31, 2011, we had a total contract drilling services backlog of approximately $13.7 billion. Our backlog as of December 31, 2011 reflects a commitment of 68 percent of operating days for 2012. See Contract Drilling Services Backlog for additional information regarding our backlog. Our principal capital resources in 2011 were cash generated from our $1.1 billion senior notes offering in February 2011, net borrowings under our bank credit facilities of $935 million and net cash from operating activities of $759 million. In February 2012, we completed, through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited (NHIL), a debt offering of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in three separate tranches, with $300 million of 2.50% Senior Notes due 2017, $400 million of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2022, and $500 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2042. The weighted average coupon of all three tranches is 4.13%. The net proceeds of approximately $1.19 billion, after expenses, were primarily used to repay the outstanding balance on our credit facilities. Our currently anticipated cash flow needs may include the following: committed capital expenditures, including expenditures for newbuild projects currently underway; normal recurring operating expenses; discretionary capital expenditures, including various capital upgrades; potential newbuild projects and acquisitions; and payments of dividends. 38 Table of Contents We currently expect to fund these cash flow needs with cash generated by our operations, cash on hand, proceeds from our 2012 senior notes offering discussed below and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. However, to adequately cover our expected cash flow needs, we may require capital in excess of the amount provided through these sources, and we may delay or cancel certain discretionary capital expenditures as necessary. Capital Expenditures Our primary liquidity requirement in 2012 will be for capital expenditures. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $2.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures for 2010 do not include the fair value of assets acquired as part of the Frontier acquisition. At December 31, 2011, we had 11 rigs under construction, and capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest, for new construction during 2011 totaled $1.7 billion, as follows (in millions): Capital Expenditures During Rig type/name 2011 Drillships Globetrotter class Noble Globetrotter I $ 221.7 Noble Globetrotter II 141.5 Gusto P10,000 HHI Drillship I 163.3 HHI Drillship II 163.1 HHI Drillship III 160.0 HHI Drillship IV 159.0 Joint venture owned drillships GustoMSC Bully PRD 12,000 Noble Bully I 161.5 Noble Bully II 185.2 Jackups FG JU 3000N Noble Jackup I 45.1 Noble Jackup II 43.6 Noble Jackup III 88.4 Noble Jackup IV 45.0 Noble Jackup V 44.7 Noble Jackup VI 44.7 Other 4.3 Total Newbuild Capital Expenditures $ 1,671.1 In addition to the newbuild expenditures noted above, capital expenditures during 2011 consisted of: $636 million for major projects, including $149 million to upgrade two drillships currently operating in Brazil; $211 million for other capitalized expenditures, including major maintenance and regulatory expenditures which generally have useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years; and $122 million in capitalized interest. 39 Table of Contents Our total capital expenditures budget for 2012 is approximately $1.9 billion, which is currently anticipated to be spent as follows: approximately $750 million in newbuild expenditures; approximately $800 million in major projects, including subsea related expenditures and contract specific projects; and approximately $275 million in sustaining capitalized expenditures. In addition to the amounts noted above, we anticipate additional charges related to capitalized interest, which may fluctuate as a result of the timing of completion of ongoing projects. In connection with our capital expenditure program, we have entered into certain commitments, including shipyard and purchase commitments, for approximately $3.0 billion at December 31, 2011, of which we expect to spend approximately $1.0 billion in 2012. From time to time we consider possible projects that would require capital expenditures or other cash expenditures that are not included in our capital budget, and such unbudgeted capital or cash expenditures could be significant. In addition, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of drilling units from time to time. Other factors that could cause actual capital expenditures to materially exceed planned capital expenditures include delays and cost overruns in shipyards (including costs attributable to labor shortages), shortages of equipment, latent damage or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions, and changes in design criteria or specifications during repair or construction. Share Repurchases, Distributions of Capital and Dividends Our Board of Directors and shareholders have authorized and adopted a share repurchase program. At December 31, 2011, 6.8 million shares remained available under this authorization. Future repurchases will be subject to the requirements of Swiss law, including the requirement that we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if and to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves are available. Also, the aggregate par value of all registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries, including treasury shares, may not exceed 10 percent of our registered share capital without shareholder approval. Our existing share repurchase program received the required shareholder approval prior to completion of our 2009 Swiss migration transaction. Share repurchases for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Total Number Average Year Ended of Shares Total Cost Price Paid December 31, Purchased (in thousands) per Share 2011 261,721 $ 10,233 $ 39.10 2010 6,390,488 230,936 36.14 2009 5,470,000 186,506 34.10 Our most recent quarterly payment to shareholders, in the form of a capital reduction, which was declared on February 3, 2012 and is to be paid on February 23, 2012 to holders of record on February 13, 2012, was 0.13 CHF per share, or an aggregate of approximately $36 million. The declaration and payment of dividends in the future by Noble Swiss and the making of distributions of capital, including returns of capital in the form of par value reductions, require authorization of the shareholders of Noble Swiss. The amount of such dividends, distributions and returns of capital will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors and shareholders. Recently, our Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholder authorization at our upcoming annual general meeting scheduled for April 27, 2012, the payment of a dividend funded from capital contribution reserve in a total amount equal to $0.52 per share to be paid in four equal installments scheduled for August 2012, November 2012, February 2013 and May 2013. If approved by our shareholders, the dividend will require us to make total cash payments of approximately $66 million in 2012, based on the number of shares currently outstanding. 40 Table of Contents Contributions to Pension Plans In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law in the U.S. The PPA requires that pension plans fund towards a target of at least 100 percent with a transition through 2011 and increases the amount we are allowed to contribute to our U.S. pension plans in the near term. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we made contributions to our non U.S. and U.S. pension plans totaling $11 million, $16 million and $18 million, respectively. We expect the minimum aggregate contributions to our non U.S. and U.S. plans in 2012, subject to applicable law, to be $19 million. We continue to monitor and evaluate funding options based upon market conditions and may increase contributions at our discretion. Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt Noble Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt We have two separate revolving credit facilities in place which provide us with a total borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion. One credit facility, which has a capacity of $600 million, matures in 2013, and during the first quarter of 2011, we entered into an additional $600 million revolving credit facility which matures in 2015 (together referred to as the Credit Facilities). The covenants and events of default under the Credit Facilities are substantially similar, and each facility contains a covenant that limits our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facilities, to 0.60. At December 31, 2011, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization was 0.35 for the credit facility maturing in 2013 and 0.33 for the credit facility maturing in 2015. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2011. In March 2012, availability under our credit facility maturing in 2013 reduces by $25 million. As discussed above, we used the proceeds from our February 2012 senior notes offering to repay the outstanding balance on our Credit Facilities. As such, we have classified the entire balance as Long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011. The Credit Facilities provide us with the ability to issue up to $300 million in letters of credit in the aggregate. While the issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities, it does reduce the amount available. At December 31, 2011, we had borrowings of $975 million outstanding and no letters of credit issued under the Credit Facilities. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our lenders under the Credit Facilities, and we believe that our lenders have the liquidity and capability to perform should the need arise for us to draw on the Credit Facilities. The indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes contain covenants that place restrictions on certain merger and consolidation transactions, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the indenture, and on the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, there are restrictions on incurring or assuming certain liens and sale and lease back transactions. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all our debt covenants. We continually monitor compliance with the covenants under our notes and, based on our expectations for 2012, expect to remain in compliance during the year. At December 31, 2011, we had letters of credit of $65 million and performance and tax assessment bonds totaling $242 million supported by surety bonds outstanding. Of the letters of credit outstanding, $32 million were issued to support bank bonds in connection with our drilling units in Nigeria. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries issue, from time to time, guarantees to the temporary import status of rigs or equipment imported into certain countries in which we operate. These guarantees are issued in lieu of payment of custom, value added or similar taxes in those countries. Our total debt was $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 as compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase in debt is a result of the issuance of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in February 2011 and $935 million of additional net borrowings on our Credit Facilities, partially offset by the repayment of $693 million in joint venture credit facilities. For additional information on our long term debt, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2011, we issued, through NHIL, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in three separate tranches, comprising $300 million of 3.05% Senior Notes due 2016, $400 million of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021, and $400 million of 6.05% Senior Notes due 2041. The weighted average coupon of all three tranches is 4.71%. A portion of the net proceeds of approximately $1.09 billion, after expenses, was used to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and to repay our portion of outstanding debt under the joint venture credit facilities discussed below. In the first quarter of 2011, the joint venture credit facilities, which had a combined outstanding balance of $693 million, were repaid in full through contributions to the joint ventures from Noble and Shell. Shell contributed $361 million in equity to fund their portion of the repayment of joint venture credit facilities and related interest rate swaps, which were settled concurrently with the repayment and termination of the joint venture credit facilities. 41 Table of Contents In January 2011, the Bully joint ventures issued notes to the joint venture partners totaling $70 million. The interest rate on these notes was 10%, payable semi annually in arrears and in kind on June 30 and December 31 commencing in June 2011. The purpose of these notes was to provide additional liquidity to the joint ventures in connection with the shipyard construction of the Bully vessels. In April 2011, the Bully joint venture partners entered into a subscription agreement, pursuant to which each partner was issued equity in each of the Bully joint ventures in exchange for the cancellation of all outstanding joint venture partner notes. The subscription agreement has the effect of converting all joint venture partner notes, including the contribution noted above, into equity of the respective joint venture. The total capital contributed as a result of these agreements was $146 million, which included $142 million in outstanding notes, plus accrued interest. Our portion of the capital contribution, totaling $73 million, was eliminated in consolidation. Summary of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Other Contractual Cash Obligations Long term debt obligations (1) $ 4,071,964 $ 25,000 $ 874,949 $ 249,647 $ 725,000 $ 299,938 $ 1,897,430 $ Interest payments 2,128,719 173,993 162,477 143,741 129,638 111,702 1,407,168 Operating leases 71,682 19,721 18,550 12,481 4,654 3,020 13,256 Pension plan contributions 104,544 6,848 6,272 6,855 7,585 9,557 67,427 Purchase commitments (2) 3,031,792 955,029 1,047,817 1,028,946 Tax reserves (3) 118,111 118,111 Total contractual cash obligations $ 9,526,812 $ 1,180,591 $ 2,110,065 $ 1,441,670 $ 866,877 $ 424,217 $ 3,385,281 $ 118,111 (1) In March 2012, availability under our credit facility maturing in 2013 reduces by $25 million. We used the proceeds from our February 2012 senior notes offering to repay the outstanding balance on our Credit Facilities; therefore, we have shown the entire balance as long term on our December 31, 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Purchase commitments consist of obligations outstanding to external vendors primarily related to future capital purchases. (3) Tax reserves are included in Other due to the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements to taxing authorities. See Note 12 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2011, we had other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash if the obligations are called. These obligations include letters of credit and surety bonds that guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts, tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions. These letters of credit and surety bond obligations are not normally called, as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments at December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Contractual Cash Obligations Letters of Credit $ 64,874 $ 64,874 $ $ $ $ $ Surety bonds 241,810 205,858 15,892 4,199 15,861 Total commercial commitments $ 306,684 $ 270,732 $ 15,892 $ 4,199 $ 15,861 $ $ 42 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. Critical accounting policies and estimates that most significantly impact our consolidated financial statements are described below. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which we hold a controlling financial interest. Our 2011 and 2010 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of two joint ventures, in each of which we own a 50 percent interest. Our ownership interest meets the definition of variable interest under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) codification and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The combined joint venture carrying amount of the Bully class drillships at December 31, 2011 totaled $1.3 billion, which was primarily funded through partner equity contributions. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying value may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $4.4 billion and $3.2 billion of construction in progress, respectively. Such amounts are included in Drilling equipment and facilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. Drilling equipment and facilities are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as of the date placed in service or date of major refurbishment. Estimated useful lives of our drilling equipment range from three to thirty years. Other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to thirty years. Interest is capitalized on construction in progress at the interest rate on debt incurred for construction or at the weighted average cost of debt outstanding during the period of construction. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $122 million, $83 million and $55 million, respectively. Overhauls and scheduled maintenance of equipment are performed based on the number of hours operated in accordance with our preventative maintenance program. Routine repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred; however, the costs of the overhauls and scheduled major maintenance projects that benefit future periods and which typically occur every three to five years are deferred when incurred and amortized over an equivalent period. The deferred portion of these major maintenance projects is included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts totaled $261 million and $183 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization of deferred costs for major maintenance projects is reflected in Depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount of such amortization was $111 million, $107 million and $102 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total repair and maintenance expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, exclusive of amortization of deferred costs for major maintenance projects, was $242 million, $186 million and $175 million, respectively. We evaluate the realization of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value. 43 Table of Contents In January 2011, we announced the signing of a MOU with Petrobras regarding operations in Brazil. Under the terms of the MOU, we agreed to substitute the Noble Phoenix, then under contract with Shell in Southeast Asia, for the Noble Muravlenko. In connection with the cancellation of the contract on the Noble Phoenix, we recognized a non cash gain of approximately $52.5 million during the first quarter of 2011, which represents the unamortized fair value of the in place contract assumed in connection with the Frontier acquisition. As a result of the substitution, we reached a decision not to proceed with the previously announced reliability upgrade to the Noble Muravlenko that was scheduled to take place in 2013. As a result, we incurred a non cash charge of approximately $32.6 million related to the termination of outstanding shipyard contracts. We expect the actual substitution to take place in the second quarter of 2012 after the Noble Phoenix completes its shipyard work. In May 2009, our jackup the Noble David Tinsley experienced a punch through while the rig was being positioned on location offshore Qatar. The incident involved the sudden penetration of all three legs through the sea bottom, which resulted in severe damage to the legs and the rig. We recorded a charge of $17 million during 2009 related to this involuntary conversion, which includes approximately $9 million for the write off of the damaged legs. During the first quarter of 2009, we recognized a charge of $12 million related to the Noble Fri Rodli, a submersible that had been cold stacked since October 2007. We recorded the charge as a result of a decision to evaluate disposition alternatives for this rig. Insurance Reserves We maintain various levels of self insured retention for certain losses including property damage, loss of hire, employment practices liability, employers liability, and general liability, among others. We accrue for property damage and loss of hire charges on a per event basis. Employment practices liability claims are accrued based on actual claims during the year. Maritime employers liability claims are generally estimated using actuarial determinations. General liability claims are estimated by our internal claims department by evaluating the facts and circumstances of each claim (including incurred but not reported claims) and making estimates based upon historical experience with similar claims. At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, loss reserves for personal injury and protection claims totaled $21 million, and such amounts are included in Other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue Recognition Revenues generated from our dayrate basis drilling contracts and labor contracts are recognized as services are performed. We may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment and personnel. Mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a drilling unit from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract. Absent a contract, the initial mobilization costs of newbuild rigs from the shipyard are deferred and amortized over the life of the rig. Subsequent costs incurred to relocate drilling units to more promising geographic areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. Lump sum payments received from customers relating to specific contracts, including equipment modifications, are deferred and amortized to income over the term of the drilling contract. Deferred revenues under drilling contracts totaled $139 million and $104 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such amounts are included in either Other Current Liabilities or Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition. We record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses. Income Taxes We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world including the United States. Income taxes have been provided based on the laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted or in which we or our subsidiaries are considered resident for income tax purposes. The income and withholding tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary significantly for each jurisdiction. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the U.S., Switzerland or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or is resident. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities do not agree with our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations, this could have a material adverse effect on us, including the imposition of a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions. Our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations and income fluctuates in the different taxing jurisdictions. 44 Table of Contents We operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our income tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its examination of our 2008 U.S. tax return. The examination team has proposed adjustments and deficiencies with respect to certain items that were reported by us for the 2008 tax year. We believe that we have accurately reported all amounts included in our 2008 tax return, and have filed protests with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the examination teams proposed adjustments. We intend to vigorously defend our reported positions. In addition, a U.S. subsidiary of Frontier is also under audit for its 2007 and 2008 tax returns. Furthermore, we are currently contesting several non U.S. tax assessments and may contest future assessments when we believe the assessments are in error. We believe the ultimate resolution of the outstanding assessments, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We recognize uncertain tax positions that we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the existing or future assessments. Certain of our non U.S. income tax returns have been examined for the 2002 through 2008 periods and audit claims have been assessed for approximately $262 million (including interest and penalties), primarily in Mexico. In Mexico, these assessments total approximately $249 million. We recently received from the Regional Chamber of the Federal Tax Court adverse decisions with respect to approximately $5 million in assessments related to depreciation deductions, which we are appealing. We are also contesting all other assessments in Mexico. However, we expect increased audit activity in Mexico and anticipate the tax authorities will issue additional assessments and continue to pursue legal actions for all audit claims. Additional audit claims of approximately $92 million attributable to customs and other business taxes have been assessed against us in other jurisdictions. We have contested, or intend to contest, these assessments, including through litigation if necessary, and we believe the ultimate resolution, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Applicable income and withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries. We do not intend to repatriate such undistributed earnings except for distributions upon which incremental income and withholding taxes would not be material. In certain jurisdictions we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. Judgment and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially utilized. When we estimate that all or some portion of certain deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount ascertained to be unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for future utilization of our deferred assets. Any change in the ability to utilize such deferred assets will be accounted for in the period of the event affecting the valuation allowance. If facts and circumstances cause us to change our expectations regarding future tax consequences, the resulting adjustments could have a material effect on our financial results or cash flow. In certain circumstances, we expect that, due to changing demands of the offshore drilling markets and the ability to redeploy our offshore drilling units, certain units will not reside in a location long enough to give rise to future tax consequences. As a result, no deferred tax asset or liability has been recognized in these circumstances. Should our expectations change regarding the length of time an offshore drilling unit will be used in a given location, we will adjust deferred taxes accordingly. Certain Significant Estimates and Contingent Liabilities The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are involved in several litigation matters, some of which could lead to potential liability to us. We follow FASB standards regarding contingent liabilities which are discussed in Part II
