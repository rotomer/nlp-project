Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, believe, could, estimated, may, plan, potential, projection, target, outlook) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward looking. Forward looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the following important factors (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward looking statements) that could cause FPL Groups or FPLs actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of FPL Group and FPL. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and FPL Group and FPL undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. The following are some important factors that could have a significant impact on FPL Groups and FPLs operations and financial results, and could cause FPL Groups and FPLs actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements: FPL Group and FPL are subject to changes in laws or regulations, including the PURPA, and the Holding Company Act, changing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of the FERC, the FPSC and the utility commissions of other states in which FPL Group has operations, and the NRC, with respect to, among other things, allowed rates of return, industry and rate structure, operation of nuclear power facilities, operation and construction of plant facilities, operation and construction of transmission facilities, acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets and facilities, recovery of fuel and purchased power costs, decommissioning costs, return on common equity and equity ratio limits, and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition (including but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs). The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery by FPL of costs that it considers excessive o r imprudently incurred. The regulatory process generally restricts FPLs ability to grow earnings and does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. FPL Group and FPL are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife mortality, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels required for the production of electricity and or increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations, and those costs could be even more significant in the future. FPL Group and FPL operate in a changing market environment influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation, regulation or restructuring of the energy industry, including deregulation of the production and sale of electricity. FPL Group and its subsidiaries will need to adapt to these changes and may face increasing competitive pressure. FPL Groups and FPLs results of operations could be affected by their ability to renegotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida. The operation of power generation facilities involves many risks, including start up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, transmission lines or pipelines, use of new technology, the dependence on a specific fuel source or the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions (including natural disasters such as hurricanes), as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. This could result in lost revenues and or increased expenses. Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the lost revenues or increased expenses, including the cost of replacement power. In addition to these risks, FPL Groups and FPLs nuclear units face certain risks that are unique to the nuclear industry including the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, as well as additional regulatory actions up to and including shutdown of the units stemming from public safety concerns, whether at FPL Groups an d FPLs plants, or at the plants of other nuclear operators. Breakdown or failure of an FPL Energy operating facility may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of the agreement or incurring a liability for liquidated damages. FPL Groups and FPLs ability to successfully and timely complete their power generation facilities currently under construction, those projects yet to begin construction or capital improvements to existing facilities is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful, FPL Group and FPL could be subject to additional costs, termination payments under committed contracts, and or the write off of their investment in the project or improvement. FPL Group and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards to manage their commodity and financial market risks, and to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities. FPL Group could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, or if a counterparty fails to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative instruments involves managements judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. In addition, FPLs use of such instruments could be subject to prudency challenges and if found imprudent, cost recovery could be disallowed by the FPSC. There are other risks associated with FPL Groups non rate regulated businesses, particularly FPL Energy. In addition to risks discussed elsewhere, risk factors specifically affecting FPL Energys success in competitive wholesale markets include the ability to efficiently develop and operate generating assets, the successful and timely completion of project restructuring activities, maintenance of the qualifying facility status of certain projects, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, competition from new sources of generation, excess generation capacity and demand for power. There can be significant volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity, and there are other financial, counterparty and market risks that are beyond the control of FPL Energy. FPL Energys inability or failure to effectively hedge its assets or positions against changes in commodity prices, interest rates, counterparty credit risk or other risk measures could significantly impair its future financial results. In keeping with industry trends, a portion of FPL Energys power generation facilities operate wholly or partially without long term power purchase agreements. As a result, power from these facilities is sold on the spot market or on a short term contractual basis, which may affect the volatility of FPL Groups financial results. In addition, FPL Energys business depends upon transmission facilities owned and operated by others; if transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable, FPL Energys ability to sell and deliver its wholesale power may be limited. FPL Group is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the power industry. In addition, FPL Group may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to successfully and timely complete and integrate them. FPL Group and FPL rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of FPL Group and FPL to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets which, in turn, could impact FPL Groups and FPLs ability to grow their businesses and would likely increase interest costs. FPL Groups and FPLs results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities, and can affect the production of electricity at wind and hydro powered facilities. In addition, severe weather can be destructive, causing outages and or property damage, which could require additional costs to be incurred. FPL Group and FPL are subject to costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims, as well as the effect of new, or changes in, tax rates or policies, rates of inflation, accounting standards, securities laws or corporate governance requirements. FPL Group and FPL are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities. Generation and transmission facilities, in general, have been identified as potential targets. The effects of terrorist threats and activities include, among other things, terrorist actions or responses to such actions or threats, the inability to generate, purchase or transmit power, the risk of a significant slowdown in growth or a decline in the U.S. economy, delay in economic recovery in the United States, and the increased cost and adequacy of security and insurance. FPL Groups and FPLs ability to obtain insurance, and the cost of and coverage provided by such insurance, could be affected by national events as well as company specific events. FPL Group and FPL are subject to employee workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key executives, availability of qualified personnel, collective bargaining agreements with union employees or work stoppage. The issues and associated risks and uncertainties described above are not the only ones FPL Group and FPL may face. Additional issues may arise or become material as the energy industry evolves. The risks and uncertainties associated with these additional issues could impair FPL Groups and FPLs businesses in the future. PART I Item 1. Business FPL GROUP FPL Group is a public utility holding company, as defined in the Holding Company Act, exempt from substantially all of the provisions of the Holding Company Act. It was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of Florida. FPL Groups principal subsidiary, FPL, is a rate regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy. FPL Group Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Group, holds the capital stock and provides funding for the operating subsidiaries other than FPL. The business activities of these operating subsidiaries primarily consist of FPL Energys non rate regulated power projects. For financial information regarding FPL Groups business segments, see Note 18. At December 31, 2003, FPL Group and its subsidiaries employed approximately 11,500 persons. Website Access to SEC Filings. FPL Group and FPL make their annual report on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, current reports on Form 8 K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on the internet website, www.fplgroup.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. FPL OPERATIONS General. FPL was incorporated under the laws of Florida in 1925 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Group. FPL supplies electric service to a population of more than eight million throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida. During 2003, FPL served approximately 4.1 million customer accounts. The percentage of FPLs operating revenues by customer class was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Residential 56 % 55 % 56 % Commercial 37 36 38 Industrial 3 3 3 Other, including the provision for retail rate refund and the net change in unbilled revenues 4 6 3 100 % 100 % 100 % FPL currently holds 173 franchise agreements to provide electric service in various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through 2034. Of the 173 franchise agreements, one expires in August 2004, eight expire in 2005 2006 and 99 expire in 2007 2013. Ongoing negotiations are taking place to renew upcoming expirations. FPL considers its franchises to be adequate for the conduct of its business. Regulation. FPLs retail operations provided approximately 99% of FPLs 2003 operating revenues. Retail operations are regulated by the FPSC which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service territory, issuances of securities, planning, siting and construction of facilities and other matters. FPL is also subject to regulation by the FERC in various respects, including the acquisition and disposition of facilities, interchange and transmission services and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy. FPLs nuclear power plants are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. NRC regulations govern the granting of licenses for the construction, operation and retirement of nuclear power plants and subject these plants to continuing review and regulation. Environmental. Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations cover air and water quality, land use, power plant and transmission line siting, EMF from power lines and substations, oil discharge from transformers, lead paint, asbestos, noise and aesthetics, solid waste, natural resources, wildlife mortality and other environmental matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of electric service by requiring, among other things, changes in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. During 2003, FPL spent approximately $23 million on capital additions to comply with environmental laws and regulations. FPLs capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations are estimated at $212 million for 2004 through 2006, including approximately $79 million in 2004, and are included in projected capital expenditures set forth in Capital Expenditures below. Environmental regulations are subject to change. The following is a discussion of emerging federal initiatives that could potentially affect FPL. Climate Change In 2002, President Bush announced new climate change initiatives for the United States, among which is a voluntary commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of United States emissions by 18% by 2012. The Bush Administration is currently seeking commitments from various industrial sectors and individual companies to reach this goal. FPL Group has responded to the administrations request by becoming a charter signatory to the Administrations Climate Leaders Program. As a participant in this voluntary program, FPL Group has inventoried its greenhouse gas emission rates and has committed to a 2008 reduction target of 18% below a 2001 baseline emission rate. FPL Group believes that the planned operation of its generating portfolio, along with its current efficiency initiatives, greenhouse gas management efforts and increased use of renewable energy will allow it to achieve this target. In addition to the voluntary initiative, the U.S. Congress is considering several legislative proposals that would establish new mandatory regulatory requirements and reduction targets for greenhouse gases. Based on reference data from government sources, FPL Group is among the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases measured by its rate of emissions to generation (lbs/mwh). However, these legislative proposals have differing methods of implementation and the impact on FPL Groups generating units and or the financial impact to FPL Group and FPL could be material (either positive or negative), depending on the eventual structure of a mandatory program. Multi Pollutant Legislation The U.S. Congress and the Bush Administration are considering several legislative proposals that would establish new regulatory requirements and reduction targets for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and in some proposals, carbon dioxide. Based on reference data from government sources, FPL Group is among the lowest generators of these emissions when measured by its rate of emissions to generation (lbs/mwh). However, these multi pollutant proposals have differing methods of implementation and the impact on FPL Groups generating units and or the financial impact to FPL Group and FPL could be material (either positive or negative), depending on the eventual structure of any legislation enacted. Retail Ratemaking. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility the opportunity to collect from customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms. The basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on FPLs investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). The rate of return on rate base approximates FPLs weighted average cost of capital, which includes its costs for debt and preferred stock and, typically, an allowed ROE. The FPSC monitors FPLs actual ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly by FPL with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that an allowed ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings, which occur at irregular intervals at the initiative of FPL, the FPSC, Public Counsel or a substantially affected party. In March 2002, the FPSC approved a new rate agreement regarding FPLs retail base rates, which became effective April 15, 2002 and expires December 31, 2005. The 2002 2005 rate agreement replaced a rate agreement that was effective April 15, 1999 through April 14, 2002. Both agreements include a revenue sharing mechanism for each of the twelve month periods covered by the agreement, whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of a stated threshold are required to be shared on the basis of two thirds refunded to retail customers and one third retained by FPL. Revenues from retail base operations in excess of a second threshold are required to be refunded 100% to retail customers. The 1999 2002 rate agreement allowed FPL at its discretion to recover, as special depreciation, up to $100 million in each year of the three year agreement period. The additional depreciation recovery was required to be applied to nuclear and or fossil generating assets based on future depreciation studies. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. During the term of the agreement, FPLs ROE was from time to time outside the 10% 12% authorized range. However, the revenue sharing mechanism described above was specified as the appropriate and exclusive mechanism to address that circumstance. The agreement included provisions which limited depreciation rates and accruals for nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs to the then approved levels and limited amounts recoverable under the environmental clause during the term of that agreement. The 2002 2005 rate agreement provides for a $250 million annual reduction in retail base revenues allocated to all customers by reducing customers base rates and service charges by approximately 7%. The revenue sharing thresholds specified in the 2002 2005 rate agreement are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2002 (a) 2003 2004 2005 (millions) 66 2/3% to customers $ 3,580 $ 3,680 $ 3,780 $ 3,880 100% to customers $ 3,740 $ 3,840 $ 3,940 $ 4,040 (a) Refund was limited to 71.5% (representing the period April 15 through December 31, 2002) of the revenues from base rate operations exceeding the thresholds. During the term of the 2002 2005 rate agreement, FPL will not have an authorized regulatory ROE range for the purpose of addressing earnings levels. However, FPL will continue to file monthly earnings surveillance reports with the FPSC and if the reported ROE falls below 10% during the term of the 2002 2005 rate agreement, FPL may petition the FPSC to amend its base rates. The 2002 2005 rate agreement would terminate on the effective date of any final order issued in a proceeding that changes FPLs base rates. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates. Under the 2002 2005 rate agreement, depreciation will be reduced on FPLs plant in service by $125 million in each year 2002 through 2005. See Note 1 Regulation and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. In April 2002, the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association and certain hospitals filed a joint notice of administrative appeal with the FPSC and the Supreme Court of Florida appealing the FPSCs approval of the 2002 2005 rate agreement. The appellants contend that the FPSC rushed to judgment and approved the settlement without the benefit of any evidentiary record to support its actions, and requested that the Supreme Court remand the case to the FPSC for additional proceedings. In November 2003, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the appeal. There is no specified time by which the Supreme Court of Florida must rule. FPL intends to continue to vigorously contest this appeal and believes that the FPSCs decision approving the 2002 2005 rate agreement will be upheld. Fuel costs are recovered from customers through levelized charges per kwh established under the fuel clause. These charges are calculated annually based on estimated fuel costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus a true up adjustment to reflect the variance of actual costs and usage from the estimates used in setting the fuel adjustment charges for prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect a projected variance based on actual costs and usage. In 2003, approximately $3.3 billion of costs were recovered through the fuel clause. During 2003, the FPSC approved fuel adjustment increases of $347 million effective April 1, 2003 and $214 million effective July 31, 2003, both of which were recovered in 2003. These increases were due to higher than projected oil and natural gas prices. During 2002, the FPSC approved a risk management fuel procurement progra m which became effective January 1, 2003. The program is intended to reduce the risk of unexpected fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. The results of the program are reviewed by the FPSC as part of the annual review of fuel costs. See Energy Marketing and Trading, Managements Discussion Results of Operations, Note 1 Regulation and Note 3. Capacity payments to other utilities and generating companies for purchased power are recovered from customers through the capacity clause and base rates. In 2003, approximately $595 million of costs were recovered through the capacity clause. Costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs totaled approximately $169 million in 2003 and were recovered from customers through the energy conservation cost recovery clause. Costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 are recovered through the environmental clause to the extent not included in base rates. The 1999 2002 rate agreement limited recovery of costs through the environmental clause. There is no similar provision in the 2002 2005 rate agreement; consequently prudent environmental costs incurred during this period and not included in base rates are recoverable under the environmental clause. In 2003, approximately $18 million was recovered fr om customers through the environmental clause. The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. Competition. FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers. In 2003, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 4% of FPLs total operating revenues. Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier. This regulatory restructuring is expected to result in a shift from cost based rates to market based rates for energy production and other services provided to retail customers. Although the legislation and initiatives vary substantially, common areas of focus include when market based pricing will be available for wholesale and retail customers, what existing prud ently incurred costs in excess of the market based price will be recoverable and whether generating assets should be separated from transmission, distribution and other assets. It is generally believed transmission and distribution activities would remain regulated. Recently, these state restructuring efforts have diminished, and several states have delayed the implementation or reversed previously approved restructuring legislation and rules. Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the electric industry in Florida in the near future. The FPSC promotes competition for building major new steam generating capacity by requiring investor owned electric utilities, such as FPL, to issue an RFP. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the needed generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and or operating generation capacity of the type proposed, the investor owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a power purchase agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC authorize the construction of the bidders generation capacity under the terms of the power purchase agreement. In 2003, FPL issued an RFP for additional power resources of approximately 1,100 mw beginning in June 2007. In January 2004, after evaluating alternative proposals, FPL concluded that its plan to build a new natural gas fired plant at it s Turkey Point site was the best and most cost effective option to provide the 1,100 mw. In March 2004, FPL plans to file a petition for approval of this alternative with the FPSC. A decision is expected by mid 2004. This alternative will also be subject to approval by a Siting Board (comprised of the governor and cabinet) under the Florida Electrical Power Plant Siting Act. The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes which could affect competition in wholesale transactions. In 1999, the FERC issued its final order on RTOs which, under a variety of structures, provides for the independent operation of transmission systems for a given geographic area. In March 2001, the FERC approved GridFlorida (FPLs, Progress Energy Florida, Inc.s and Tampa Electric Companys proposed RTO) as the RTO for peninsular Florida. In December 2001, the FPSC determined that the RTO as proposed was not in the best interest of Florida customers and required the companies to develop a modified proposal. In March 2002, FPL, Progress Energy Florida, Inc. and Tampa Electric Company filed a modified RTO proposal with the FPSC changing the structure of GridFlorida from a for profit transmission company to a non profit ISO. Under the proposal, FPL would continue to own its transmission lines and the ISO would manage them. In September 2002, the FPSC approved many of the aspects of the modified RTO proposal, allowing recovery of GridFloridas incremental costs through the capacity clause. In October 2002, the Public Counsel filed a notice of administrative appeal with the Supreme Court of Florida seeking an appeal of the FPSCs order. In June 2003, the Florida Supreme Court dismissed the Public Counsels appeal of the FPSCs approval of GridFlorida without prejudice concluding that the appeal was premature because the FPSC proceedings had not yet been completed and not all aspects of the FPSCs order on appeal were considered final agency action. The FPSC has restored the GridFlorida docket to active status and in December 2003 issued a procedural order establishing a series of workshops through 2004 to address GridFlorida issues. In July 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to reform public utilities transmission tariffs and implement a standardized design for electric markets in the United States. The proposed rule would, among other things, require FERC regulated entities, including FPL, that own, control or operate transmission facilities to hire an independent transmission provider, which can be an RTO such as GridFlorida for the operation of those facilities. The proposed rule also will require the independent transmission provider to administer various spot markets for the sale of electricity and ancillary services and to manage congestion on the transmission system using financial congestion rights. Legislators and regulators from the southeast and western states have expressed strong reservations about the FERCs proposal. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper responding to comments on its proposed rule. The White Paper indicates that the FERC int ends to be more flexible on how and when the final rule will be implemented, defer to regional state committees to address significant RTO/ISO features, require regulated utilities to join RTOs or ISOs and require RTOs to implement spot markets. While a moratorium on further action by the FERC was included in the proposed Energy Policy Act, the status of that legislation is uncertain. FPL is evaluating the proposed FERC rule and is currently unable to determine its effects, if any, on FPLs operations. In the event the basis of regulation for some or all of FPLs business changes from cost based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment. See Note 1 Regulation. System Capability and Load. During 2003, FPL completed the addition of two new gas fired combustion turbines at its Fort Myers site and the repowering of Sanford Unit No. 4, totaling approximately 1,300 mw. In addition, FPL is constructing approximately 1,900 mw of natural gas combined cycle generation at its Martin and Manatee sites with a planned in service date of June 2005. In January 2003, CPV Gulfcoast, Ltd. filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Florida challenging the FPSCs 2002 approval of the Martin and Manatee expansion and in April 2003, filed its initial brief. In May 2003, FPL filed its answer brief, which included a request for dismissal. The Supreme Court of Florida will not hold oral arguments. There is no specified time by which the Supreme Court of Florida must rule. See Competition regarding plans for an additional 1,100 mw begi nning in June 2007. As of December 31, 2003, FPLs resources for serving load consisted of 22,197 mw, of which 19,056 mw are from FPL owned facilities (see Item 2. Properties Generating Facilities) and 3,141 mw are obtained through purchased power contracts. See Note 17 Contracts. FPLs projected reserve margin for the summer of 2004 is 20%. This reserve margin will be achieved through the combination of output from FPLs generating units, purchased power contracts and the capability to reduce peak demand through the implementation of load management, which was estimated to be 1,533 mw at December 31, 2003. Customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in FPLs service territory. FPL set an all time record summer energy peak on July 9, 2003, of 19,668 mw. Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity us age for short periods of time. The highest energy peak FPL has served to date was a winter peak of 20,190 mw, which occurred on January 24, 2003. FPL had adequate resources available at the time of these peaks to meet customer demand. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures at FPL consist of the cost for construction or acquisition of additional facilities and equipment to meet customer demand, as well as capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities. FPLs capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion in 2003 (including AFUDC of approximately $18 million), $1.3 billion in 2002 and $1.1 billion in 2001. Capital expenditures for 2004 through 2008 are estimated to be as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Total FPL: (millions) Generation: (a) New (b) $ 385 $ 290 $ 265 $ 105 $ $ 1,045 Existing 430 430 355 455 270 1,940 Transmission and distribution 605 700 690 700 715 3,410 Nuclear fuel 95 75 80 100 80 430 General and other 130 155 175 180 165 805 Total $ 1,645 $ 1,650 $ 1,565 $ 1,540 $ 1,230 $ 7,630 (a) Includes AFUDC of approximately $61 million, $52 million, $39 million, $59 million and $71 million in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. (b) Includes generating structures, transmission interconnection and integration, licensing and AFUDC. These estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from this estimate. See Managements Discussion Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 17 Commitments. Nuclear Operations. FPL owns and operates four nuclear units, two at Turkey Point and two at St. Lucie. The Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 received operating license extensions in 2002, which give FPL the option to operate these units until 2032 and 2033, respectively. The NRC extended the operating licenses for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 during 2003, which give FPL the option to operate these units until 2036 and 2043, respectively. The original license expiration dates for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 and St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 are 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2023, respectively. FPL has not yet decided to exercise the option to operate past the original license expiration dates, although FPL is continuing to take actions to ensure the long term viability of the units in order to preserve this option. The decision will be made for Turkey Point Uni ts Nos. 3 and 4 by 2007 and for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 by 2011. Any adjustment to depreciation and decommissioning rates would require FPSC approval. The nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require the unit to be removed from service for approximately 30 days. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages by unit are as follows: Refueling Outage Unit Most Recent Next Scheduled St. Lucie Unit No. 1 Fall 2002 Spring 2004 St. Lucie Unit No. 2 Spring 2003 Winter 2004 Turkey Point Unit No. 3 Spring 2003 Fall 2004 (a) Turkey Point Unit No. 4 Fall 2003 Spring 2005 (a) (a) FPL anticipates replacing the reactor vessel head during this outage, which will extend the amount of days the unit will be removed from service to approximately 65 days. The NRCs regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years prior to the projected end of plant operation. FPLs current plans, under the existing operating licenses, provide for prompt dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Current plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2016 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 beginning in 2023. See estimated decommissioning cost data in Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plant. In 2003, the NRC issued an order, subsequent to a previously issued NRC bulletin, requiring all pressurized water reactor licensees, including FPL, to perform visual and volumetric inspections of reactor vessel heads at each units scheduled refueling outage to identify if degradation such as cracking or corrosion has occurred. During the scheduled refueling outages for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 in October 2002, Turkey Point Unit No. 3 in March 2003 and Turkey Point Unit No. 4 in October 2003, FPL performed visual and volumetric inspections and found no degradation associated with the reactor vessel heads. In late April and early May 2003, while volumetric inspections of the reactor vessel head at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 were being performed during a scheduled refueling outage, two control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) nozzles were found with one small crack in each. Both cracks were less than 50% through the thickness of the CRDM nozzle. No leakage was observed and both cracks were repaired during the outage. Also during the St. Lucie Unit No. 2 scheduled refueling outage, the steam generators were inspected and more tubes had to be plugged than anticipated. The inspection results were evaluated and revised tube plugging projections developed. Management intends to replace the steam generators at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2007 and will delay the reactor vessel head replacement for St. Lucie Unit No. 2 until 2007 to coincide with the steam generator replacement. FPL anticipates replacing the reactor vessel heads at Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 during their next scheduled refueling outage and at St. Lucie Unit No. 1 during a scheduled refueling outage in the fall of 2005. Reactor vessel head replacements for these three units are expected to add approximately 35 days to the number of days a unit is removed from service during a typical scheduled refueling outage. The cost for the reactor vessel heads and stea m generators is included in FPLs estimated capital expenditures above. In 2003, the NRC issued a bulletin recommending that utilities with bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations perform visual inspections. Visual inspections of the bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations were performed in 2003 during Turkey Point Unit No. 4s scheduled refueling outage, and no evidence of leakage from these penetrations was noted. A visual inspection of Turkey Point Unit No. 3s bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations will be performed at its next scheduled refueling outage in the fall of 2004. St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 do not have bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations. Fuel. FPLs generating plants use a variety of fuels. See Item 2. Properties Generating Facilities and Note 17 Contracts. The diverse fuel options, along with purchased power, enable FPL to shift between sources of generation to achieve an economical fuel mix. FPL has four firm transportation contracts in place with FGT and one firm transportation contract with Gulfstream that together will satisfy substantially all of the anticipated needs for natural gas transportation at its existing units and the units currently under construction. The four existing FGT contracts expire in 2015, 2021 and 2022, while the Gulfstream contract expires in 2028. Two of the contracts expiring in 2015 may each be extended by FPL until 2030. To the extent desirable, FPL can also purchase interruptible gas transportation service from FGT and Gulfstream based on pipeline availability. FPL has several short and medium term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPLs anticipated needs for natural gas. The remainder of FPLs gas requirements are purchased under other contracts and in the spot market. FPL has, through its joint ownership interest in St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) Units Nos. 1 and 2, long term coal supply and transportation contracts for a portion of the fuel needs for those units. All of the transportation requirements and a portion of the fuel supply needs for Scherer Unit No. 4 are covered by a series of annual and long term contracts. The remaining fuel requirements will be obtained in the spot market. FPLs oil requirements are obtained under short term contracts and in the spot market. FPL leases nuclear fuel for all four of its nuclear units. See Note 1 Nuclear Fuel. On July 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL began consolidating the lessor entity in accordance with FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." See Note 10 FPL. The contracts for the supply, conversion, enrichment and fabrication of FPLs nuclear fuel have expiration dates ranging from 2006 through 2013. Currently, FPL is storing spent fuel on site pending its removal by the DOE. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the DOE was required to construct permanent disposal facilities and take title to and provide transportation and disposal for spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 for a specified fee based on current generation from nuclear power plants. Through December 2003, FPL has paid approximately $496 million in such fees to the DOEs nuclear waste fund. The DOE did not meet its statutory obligation for disposal of spen t nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. In 1997, a court ruled, in response to petitions filed by utilities, state governments and utility commissions, that the DOE could not assert a claim that its delay was unavoidable in any defense against lawsuits by utilities seeking money damages arising out of the DOEs failure to perform its obligations. In 1998, FPL filed a lawsuit against the DOE seeking damages caused by the DOEs failure to dispose of spent nuclear fuel from FPLs nuclear power plants. The matter is pending. In the interim, FPL is investigating other alternatives to provide adequate storage capacity for all of its spent nuclear fuel. Based on current projections, FPL will lose its ability to store spent fuel on site for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 in 2005, St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2007, Turkey Point Unit No. 3 in 2007 and Turkey Point Unit No. 4 in 2009. In addition, degradation in a material used in the spent fuel pools at St. Lucie Unit No. 1 and Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 could result in implementation of alternative spent fuel storage options sooner than projected. FPL is pursuing various approaches to further expand spent fuel storage at the sites, including increasing rack space in its existing spent fuel pools and or developing the capacity to store spent fuel in dry storage containers. FPL has submitted license amendment requests to the NRC for approval of additional storage racks. Approval of these requests is expected by May 2004. Once installed, these racks will extend the storage capacity such that the ability to store spent fuel will not be lost until 2008 at St. Lucie Unit No. 1, 2010 at St. Lucie Unit No. 2, 2010 at Turkey Point Unit No. 3 and 2012 at Turkey Point Unit No. 4. If approved, the dry storage containers could be located at FPLs nuclear plant sites and or at a facility operated by PFS in Utah. PFS is a consortium of eight utiliti es seeking to license, construct and operate an independent spent fuel storage facility. FPL joined the consortium in May 2000. PFS has filed a license application with the NRC and hearings on the application have been completed. In March 2003, PFS requested that the NRC review the ASLBs decision that requires PFS to address the consequences of a hypothetical military aircraft accident into its proposed facility before such facility is licensed. PFS has also initiated further proceedings before the ASLB to address the consequences of such an accident. Licensing on other environmental issues litigated during the hearings remain pending before the ASLB. In addition, the State of Utah has appealed certain decisions of the ASLB. In April 2002, the governor of Nevada submitted a Notice of Disapproval to Congress regarding President Bushs recommendation to develop Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste depository. The Yucca Mountain site is the DOEs recommended location to store and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste. During May and July 2002, Congress overrode the Notice of Disapproval through a majority vote of both houses. The President signed the joint resolution of Congress into law on July 23, 2002. The State of Nevada has initiated legal actions to attempt to block the project. Energy Marketing and Trading. EMT, a division of FPL, buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and electric power. EMT procures natural gas and oil for FPLs use in power generation and sells excess gas and electric power. EMT also uses derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards to manage the commodity price risk inherent in fuel purchases and electricity sales and purchases. Substantially all of the results of EMTs activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses. See Retail Ratemaking, Managements Discussion Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 3. Electric and Magnetic Fields. In recent years, public, scientific and regulatory attention has been focused on possible adverse health effects of EMF. These fields are created whenever electricity flows through a power line or an appliance. Several epidemiological (i.e., statistical) studies have suggested a linkage between EMF and certain types of cancer, including childhood leukemia and adult lymphoma associated with occupational exposure; other studies have been inconclusive, contradicted earlier studies or have shown no such linkage. Neither these epidemiological studies nor clinical studies have produced any conclusive evidence that EMF does or does not cause adverse health effects. In 1999, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, at the culmination of a five year federally supported research effort, pronounced that the scientific support for an EMF cancer link is margina l and concluded that the probability that EMF exposure is truly a health hazard is small but cannot be completely discounted. In 2001, the IARC conducted an evaluation of power frequency EMF and cancer; it classified power frequency magnetic fields as "possibly carcinogenic" based on an association with childhood leukemia reported in some epidemiology studies. The IARC did not conclude that power frequency EMF cause or contribute to the development of childhood leukemia or any other cancer. In 2002, the California Department of Health Services submitted its EMF Risk Evaluation report to the California Public Utility Commission. The report concludes in part that "EMFs can cause some degree of increased risk of childhood leukemia, adult brain cancer, Lou Gehrigs Disease and miscarriage." The report also finds that the risk, while potentially low across the entire population, nonetheless may be sufficient to warrant regulatory attention. Florida has had EMF regulations in place for many years, and FPL believes it is in compliance with the FDEP regulations regarding EMF levels within and at the edge of the rights of way for transmission lines. Future changes in the FDEP regulations could require additional capital expenditures by FPL for such things as increasing the width of right of way or relocating or reconfiguring transmission facilities. It is not presently known whether any such expenditures will be required. Currently, there are no such changes proposed to the FDEP regulations. Employees. FPL had approximately 9,600 employees at December 31, 2003. Approximately 32% of the employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) under a collective bargaining agreement with FPL that will expire on October 31, 2004. FPL ENERGY OPERATIONS General. FPL Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Group Capital, was formed in 1998 to aggregate FPL Groups existing non rate regulated energy related operations. It is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware. FPL Energy owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates domestic electric generating facilities in wholesale energy markets. FPL Energy manages or participates in the management of approximately 82% of its projects, which represent approximately 96% of the net generating capacity in which FPL Energy has an ownership interest. At December 31, 2003, FPL Energy had net generating capability totaling 11,041 mw, all of which consisted of ownership interests in operating independent power projects (see Item 2. Properties Generating Facilities). Generation capacity spans various regions thereby reducing seasonal volatility on a portfolio basis . At December 31, 2003, the percentage of capacity by NERC region or power pool was: NERC Region/Power Pool Percentage of Generation Capacity NEPOOL/NYPP 26% MAPP/MAIN/SPP/ERCOT 38% SERC/PJM 18% WECC 18% Fuel sources for these projects were as follows: Fuel Source Percentage of Generation Capacity Natural Gas 55% Wind 25% Nuclear 9% Oil 6% Hydro 3% Other 2% FPL Energys capital expenditures and investments totaled approximately $1.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital expenditures for 2004 through 2008 are estimated to be as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Total (millions) FPL Energy: (a) Gas $ 140 $ 5 $ $ $ $ 145 Nuclear fuel and other 85 35 60 60 15 255 Total $ 225 $ 40 $ 60 $ 60 $ 15 $ 400 (a) Estimated capital expenditures exclude estimates for the development of new wind projects pending the enactment of legislation reestablishing the production tax credits for new wind facilities. FPL Energy is currently constructing a gas fired power plant with a total capacity of approximately 744 mw. The plant is expected to be in operation in the second half of 2004. During 2002, FPL Energy was engaged in the development of various other natural gas projects. As a result of depressed economic conditions coupled with an oversupply of energy generating facilities in certain markets, projected profit margins for these projects declined and were not sufficient to cover the cost of capital. Therefore, FPL Energy made a strategic decision during 2002 to substantially exit the fossil fueled greenfield merchant power plant development business for the foreseeable future. As a result, development costs associated with these abandoned projects were written off to expense. Furthermore, FPL Energy realigned its organizational structure during 2002 to lower general and administrative expenses and took other actions associated with the restructur ing. See Managements Discussion Results of Operations FPL Energy and Note 6 FPL Energy. FPL Energy expects its future portfolio capacity growth to come from a mix of asset acquisitions and wind development, assuming pending legislation reestablishing the production tax credits for new wind facilities is enacted, either of which would increase estimated capital expenditures. Energy Marketing and Trading. PMI, a subsidiary of FPL Energy, buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and electric power. PMI procures natural gas and oil for FPL Energys use in power generation and sells any excess gas. PMI also sells the output from FPL Energys plants which has not been sold under long term contracts and purchases replacement power. PMI uses derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and to optimize the value of FPL Energys power generation assets. To a lesser extent, PMI engages in limited energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. The results of PMIs activities are recognized in FPL Energys operating results. See Managements Discussion Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Ris k Sensitivity, Note 1 Energy Trading and Note 3. Employees. FPL Energy had approximately 1,800 employees at December 31, 2003. The IBEW and the Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA) represented approximately 5% and 12%, respectively, of FPL Energys employees. The collective bargaining agreement between an FPL Energy subsidiary and the IBEW expires in February 2008 and the collective bargaining agreement between an FPL Energy subsidiary and the UWUA expires in September 2008. Regulation. Currently, approximately 6% of FPL Energys net generating capacity has qualifying facility status under PURPA. FPL Energys qualifying facilities generate electricity from wind, solar, fossil fuels, biomass or waste product combustion. Qualifying facility status exempts the projects from, among other things, the application of the Holding Company Act, many provisions of the Federal Power Act, and state laws and regulations relating to rates and financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities. FPL Energy also has ownership interests in operating independent power projects that have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Holding Company Act, which represent approximately 94% of FPL Energys net generating capacity. Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers. FPL Energys exempt wholesale generators produce electricity from wind, hydropower, fossil fuels and nuclear facilities. While projects with qualifying facility and exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws. FPL Energy continues to evaluate the FERCs proposed rule on standard market design in areas where it is not already in effect. See FPL Operations Competition. California is scheduled to implement standard market design in the first quarter of 2007. ERCOT is considering adopting standard market design, or portions thereof, with potential implementation as soon as 2006. In both markets, the final market design is not fully known at this time and FPL Energy is currently unable to determine the effects, if any, on its operation resulting from the implementation of standard market design. Environmental. FPL Energy is subject to the same environmental laws and regulations and is affected by the same emerging issues included in the discussion of FPLs business. See FPL Operations Environmental. During 2003, FPL Energy spent approximately $14 million on capital additions to comply with environmental laws and regulations. FPL Energys capital additions to comply with environmental laws and regulations are estimated to total $25 million for 2004 through 2006, including approximately $4 million in 2004, and are included in estimated capital expenditures set forth in General above. Competition. Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary by geographic region. Revenues from electricity sales in these markets will vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other ancillary services. Some of the factors affecting success in these markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth and exposure to legal and regulatory changes. Expanded competition in a relaxed regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for FPL Energy. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets divested under deregulation plans and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets. Wholesale energy markets have experienced lower demand and lower wholesale electricity prices as a result of weather and economic conditions and the oversupply of generation in certain regions. FPL Energy seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio, by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants. As of December 31, 2003, FPL Energy had 74% of its on peak capacity under contract for 2004. Over the last several years, contracting for the sale of electricity output has become more difficult, as a result of overcapacity in certain regions and dimin ished market liquidity due to fewer creditworthy counterparties. Given current market conditions, when FPL Energys existing power sales agreements expire, more of the energy produced may be sold through shorter term contracts and into competitive wholesale markets. Portfolio by Category. FPL Energys assets can be categorized into the following three groups: wind assets, non wind assets under long term contract and merchant assets. As of December 31, 2003, FPL Energys capacity under contract for 2004 was as follows: Asset Class Available MW (a) % MW Under Contract Wind 2,719 99 % Non wind assets under long term contract 1,255 98 % Merchant: Seabrook 1,024 97 % NEPOOL/PJM/NYPP 1,879 34 % (b) ERCOT 3,009 65 % (b) Other (WECC/SERC) 1,345 60 % (b) Total portfolio 11,231 74 % (a) Weighted to reflect in service dates and planned maintenance. (b) Represents on peak mw under contract. Wind Assets During 2003, FPL Energy added 14 wind projects to its portfolio, totaling approximately 975 mw. Project additions also included the construction of 811 mw of new capacity and the acquisition of 164 mw of operating plants. At December 31, 2003, FPL Energy had ownership interests in 42 operating wind plants, with a combined capacity of approximately 2,719 mw (net ownership). FPL Energy operates all but ten of these wind facilities. Approximately 88% of FPL Energys net ownership in wind facilities has received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Holding Company Act. The remaining facilities have qualifying facility status under PURPA. These facilities are located in fifteen states, thereby reducing weather related performance risk on a portfolio basis. In 2004, essentially all wind energy has been contracted with utilities and power marketers under fixed price agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2028. Non Wind Assets Under Long Term Contract At December 31, 2003, FPL Energy had 1,255 mw of non wind assets under long term contract. Essentially all of these non wind assets were under long term power sales contracts with utilities, with contract expiration dates ranging from 2008 to 2021 and have firm fuel and transportation agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2017. Approximately 1,096 mw of this capacity is gas fired generation. The remaining 159 mw uses a variety of fuels and technologies such as waste to energy, solar, coal and petroleum coke. Of these facilities 32% have qualifying facility status under PURPA and 68% have received exempt wholesale generator status under the Holding Company Act. Merchant Assets Merchant assets are plants that have not sold the majority of their output under long term contracts. The output from these merchant plants is sold through a combination of short to medium term contracts and sales in wholesale markets. Beginning in 2003, FPL Energy began providing load following services to distribution utilities in NEPOOL. Load following services require the supplier of energy to vary the quantity delivered based on the load demand needs of the customer. The vast majority of the merchant assets have firm gas supply agreements or a combination of firm gas supply and transportation agreements to cover on peak gas requirements. PMI uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases. At December 31, 2003, FPL Energys portfolio of merchant assets includes 7,067 mw of owned nuclear, natural gas, oil and hydro generation of which 2,973 mw is located in ERCOT, 2,590 mw in NEPOOL, 839 mw in SERC, 507 mw in WECC and 158 mw in other regions. The merchant assets include 1,653 mw of peak generating facilities. In addition, there are approximately 744 mw of gas fired generation under construction in PJM that are expected to be in operation in the second half of 2004. Nuclear Operations. In November 2002, an FPL Energy subsidiary purchased an 88.23% undivided interest in Seabrook, located in New Hampshire. FPL Energys net ownership interest in Seabrooks capacity consists of 1,024 mw of nuclear generation. FPL Energy is responsible for all plant operations. The current operating license for Seabrook expires in 2026. FPL Energy intends to seek approval from the NRC to extend the units license to recapture the period of non operation from 1986 to 1990, in addition to a 20 year license extension. If granted, these approvals would extend the term of the NRC operating license for Seabrook to 2050. Preparations are in progress for a power uprate at Seabrook that is expected to increase plant capability by approximately 100 mw; the cost of which are included in FPL Energys capital expenditure table above. This uprate will be imp lemented in two phases and requires approval by the NRC and the New England ISO. The main portion of the uprate is expected to be implemented in the spring of 2005 and the final portion in the fall of 2006. At the time of the Seabrook acquisition, FPL Energy assumed responsibility for the ultimate decommissioning of the plant, the cost of which will be shared on a pro rata basis by the joint owners. See estimated decommissioning cost data in Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plant. In 2003, the NRC issued an order, subsequent to a previously issued NRC bulletin, requiring all pressurized water reactor licensees, including Seabrook, to perform visual and volumetric inspections of reactor vessel heads to identify if degradation such as cracking or corrosion has occurred. Seabrook will be required to perform 100% visual and volumetric inspections in 2006, and subsequently, visual inspections every third outage and volumetric inspections every fourth outage. In 2003, the NRC issued a bulletin recommending that utilities with bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations perform visual inspections. In October 2003, visual inspections of the bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations were performed during Seabrooks scheduled refueling outage, and no evidence of leakage from these penetrations was noted. The next refueling outage is scheduled to be performed in April 2005. Seabrook has several contracts for the supply, conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates ranging from 2004 to 2014. See Note 17 Contracts. Currently, Seabrook is storing spent fuel on site pending its removal by the DOE. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the DOE was required to construct permanent disposal facilities and take title to and provide transportation and disposal for spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 for a specified fee based on current generation from nuclear power plants. From the time of the acquisition of Seabrook through December 2003, FPL Energy has paid approximately $8 million in such fees to the DOEs nuclear waste fund. For details on the current status of permanent fuel storage with the DOE see FPL Operations Fuel. Based on current projections, FPL Energy will lose its ability to store spent fuel at Seabrook as early as 2009. FPL Energy is investigating other a lternatives to expand its spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at Seabrook. OTHER FPL GROUP OPERATIONS FPL Groups Corporate and Other segment represents other business activities, primarily FPL FiberNet, that are not separately reportable. See Note 18. FPL FiberNet. FPL FiberNet was formed in January 2000 to enhance the value of FPL Groups fiber optic network assets that were originally built to support FPL operations. Accordingly, in January 2000, FPLs existing fiber optic lines were transferred to FPL FiberNet. FPL FiberNet is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware. FPL FiberNet leases wholesale fiber optic network capacity and dark fiber to FPL and other new and existing customers, primarily telephone, internet and other telecommunications companies. Dark fiber in the metro market is also sold to third parties. FPL FiberNets primary business focus is the Florida metro market. Metro networks cover Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando and Jacksonville. FPL FiberNet also has a long haul network within Florida that leases bandwidth at wholesale rates. At December 31, 2003, FPL FiberNets network consisted of approximately 2,500 r oute miles, which interconnected major cities throughout Florida. During 2003, FPL FiberNet added the latest generation of Ethernet services which provides the option for its customers to upgrade their existing telecommunications network. Due to the changing telecommunications market, FPL FiberNet completed valuation studies to assess the recoverability of its assets and as a result, in 2002, wrote off some of these assets to expense. This write off represents an impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment, the fair value of which was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, FPL FiberNet decided not to pursue the planned build out of metro fiber rings in certain cities, and restructuring charges were recognized in 2002 related to the write off of development costs and inventory. See Managements Discussion Results of Operations Corporate and Other and Note 6 Corporate and Other. At December 31, 2003, FPL Groups investment in FPL FiberNet totaled approximately $240 million. FPL FiberNet invested approximately $10 million during 2003 and plans to invest a total of $50 million over the next five years to sustain its fiber optic network and meet customers specific requirements.

Several of FPL Energys generating facilities are encumbered by liens against their assets securing various financings. See Generating Facilities and Note 1 Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. Item 3. Legal Proceedings In November 1999, the Attorney General of the United States, on behalf of the EPA, brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Georgia Power Company and other subsidiaries of The Southern Company for certain alleged violations of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions and the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) of the Clean Air Act. In May 2001, the EPA amended its complaint. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that Georgia Power Company constructed and is continuing to operate Scherer Unit No. 4, in which FPL owns a 76% interest, without obtaining a PSD permit, without complying with NSPS requirements, and without applying best available control technology for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides and particulate matter as required by the Clean Air Act. It also alleges that unspecified major modifications have been made at Scherer Unit No. 4 that require its compliance with the aforementioned Clean Air Act provision s. The EPA seeks injunctive relief requiring the installation of best available control technology and civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day for each violation from an unspecified date after June 1, 1975 through January 30, 1997 and $27,500 per day for each violation thereafter. Under a proposed EPA rule, the maximum penalty would increase to $32,500 per day for each violation after publication of the final rule. Georgia Power Company has answered the amended complaint, asserting that it has complied with all requirements of the Clean Air Act, denying the plaintiffs allegations of liability, denying that the plaintiff is entitled to any of the relief that it seeks and raising various other defenses. In June 2001, the federal district court stayed discovery and administratively closed the case pending resolution of the EPAs motion for consolidation of discovery in several Clean Air Act cases that was filed with a Multi District Litigation (MDL) panel. In August 2001, the MDL panel denied the motion for consolidation. In September 2001, the EPA moved that the federal district court reopen this case for purposes of discovery. Georgia Power Company opposed that motion asking that the case remain closed until the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) appeal of an EPA administrative compliance order relating to legal issues that are also central to this case. In August 2002, the federal district court denied without prejudice the EPAs motion to reopen. In June 2003, the Eleventh Circuit issued its order dismissing the TVAs appeal because it found the provision of the Clean Air Act allowing the EPA to issue binding administrative compliance orders was unconstitutional, and hence found that the TVA order was a non final order that courts of appeal do not have jurisdiction to review. In September 2003, the Eleventh Circuit denied the EPAs motion for rehearing, and the EPA is now evaluating whether to seek review of the Eleventh Circuit decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The EPA has not yet moved to reopen the Georgia Power Company case. In November 2001, J. W. and Ernestine M. Thomas, Chester and Marie Jenkins, and Ray Norman and Jack Teague, as Co Personal Representatives on behalf of the Estate of Robert L. Johns, served FPL Group, FPL, FPL FiberNet, FPL Group Capital and FPL Investments, Inc. (FPL Investments) as defendants in a civil action filed in the Circuit Court for Suwanee County, Florida. This action is purportedly on behalf of all property owners in Florida (excluding railroad and public rights of way) whose property is encumbered by easements in favor of FPL, and on whose property defendants have installed or intend to install fiber optic cable which defendants currently lease, license or convey or intend to lease, license or convey for non electric transmission or distribution purposes. The lawsuit alleges that FPLs easements do not permit the installation and use of fiber optic cable for general communication purposes. The plaintiffs have asserted claims for unlawful det ainer, unjust enrichment and constructive trust and seek injunctive relief and compensatory damages. In May 2002, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding allegations regarding the installation of wireless communications equipment on some easements, and adding a claim for declaratory relief. In August 2002, Hazel and Lamar Jenkins were substituted for Chester and Marie Jenkins as plaintiffs. Defendants filed an answer and affirmative defenses to the amended complaint in August 2002. The parties are now pursuing discovery. In September 2003, FPL Group Capital and FPL Investments moved for summary judgment as to all claims asserted against them. Additionally, in October 2003, FPL Group moved for summary judgment as to all claims asserted against it. These motions have been granted and FPL Group, FPL Group Capital and FPL Investments have been dismissed from this lawsuit. The court is currently scheduled to hear argumen t on whether this case will proceed as a class action sometime in late June 2004. In August 2001, FMPA filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (DC Circuit) a petition for review asking the DC Circuit to reverse and remand orders of the FERC denying FMPAs request for credits for transmission facilities owned by FMPA members. The transmission credits sought by FMPA would offset the transmission charges that FPL bills FMPA for network transmission service to FMPAs member cities. FMPA member cities have been taking network transmission service under FPLs open access transmission tariff since 1996. In the orders appealed by FMPA, FERC ruled that FMPA would be entitled to credits for any FMPA facilities that were "integrated" with the FPL transmission system. Based on the evidence submitted, FERC concluded that none of the FMPA facilities met the integration test and, therefore, FMPA was not entitled to credits against FPLs charges for transmission service. In January 2003, the DC Circuit upheld FERCs order denying FMPA credits for its facilities; in March 2003, the DC Circuit denied FMPAs rehearing request of the DC Circuits decision; and in October 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court denied FMPAs petition for review of the DC Circuits decision. FMPA also has requested that FERC decide the crediting issue again in a separate FERC proceeding. That proceeding dates back to a filing by FPL in 1993 of a comprehensive restructuring of its then existing tariff structure. All issues in that case are settled except for three issues reserved by FMPA, one of which is the crediting issue. FPL previously estimated the exposure for the crediting issue at $65 million. With the passage of time, the exposure has grown to $71 million as of December 31, 2003. However, in December 2003, FERC issued a ruling on the three reserved issues. With respect to the crediting issue, FERC stated that it had previously determined that FMPA was not entitled to credits for its facilities in th e related proceeding discussed above and saw no persuasive reason to revisit that determination in this proceeding. With respect to the second issue, FERC directed FPL to make a compliance filing of a proposed rate schedule that does not include those facilities of FPL that fail to meet the same integration test applied to the FMPA facilities. With respect to the third reserved issue, FERC affirmed its previous ruling against FMPA. In January 2004, FMPA requested a "conditional rehearing on the Commissions failure to order rate credits solely in the event that Commission does not adequately reduce FPLs rate base to achieve comparability." On January 30, 2004, FPL filed an answer to FMPAs request for rehearing, asking that the request be denied. Unless FERC accepts and responds favorably to FMPAs rehearing request, FPLs exposure will be limited to refunds arising from the exclusion of FPL facilities that fail to meet the integration test from its rat e schedule. In February 2003, Scott and Rebecca Finestone brought an action on behalf of themselves and their son Zachary Finestone in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that their son has developed cancer (neuroblastoma) as a result of the release and or dissipation into the air, water, soil and underground areas of radioactive and non radioactive hazardous materials, including strontium 90, and the release of other toxic materials from FPLs St. Lucie nuclear power plant. The complaint includes counts against FPL for strict liability for allegedly engaging in an ultra hazardous activity and for alleged negligence in operating the plant in a manner that allowed emissions of the foregoing materials and failing to limit its release of nuclear fission products as prescribed by federal and state laws and regulations. The plaintiffs seek damages in excess of $1 million. FPL moved to dismiss the complaint. In September 2003, the court entered an order denying FPLs motion to dismiss. Following FPLs motion for reconsideration in the Blake and Lowe lawsuit, discussed below, the court entered a similar order vacating its order denying the motion to dismiss the count for strict liability, and upon reconsideration granted FPLs motion to dismiss the count for strict liability. In May 2003, Tish Blake and John Lowe, as personal representatives of the Estate of Ashton Lowe, on behalf of the estate and themselves, as surviving parents, brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that their son developed cancer (medulo blastoma) as a result of the release and or dissipation into the air, water, soil and underground areas of radioactive and non radioactive hazardous materials, including strontium 90, and the release of other toxic materials from FPLs St. Lucie nuclear power plant. The allegations, counts and damages demanded in the complaint are virtually identical to those contained in the Finestone lawsuit described above. FPL moved to dismiss the complaint. In September 2003, the court entered an order denying FPLs motion to dismiss. FPL moved for reconsideration of the courts order as to the count for strict liability. The court then entered an order vacating the order denying t he motion to dismiss as to the count for strict liability, and upon reconsideration granted FPLs motion to dismiss the count for strict liability. In March 2003, James J. and Lori Bradstreet brought an action on behalf of themselves and their son, Matthew Bradstreet, in the Circuit Court of the 18th Judicial Circuit in and for Brevard County, Florida, against Aventis Pasteur and a number of other named and unnamed drug manufacturing and distribution companies, the American Dental Association, the Florida Dental Association, FPL and the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC), alleging that their son has suffered toxic neurological effects from mercury poisoning. An amended complaint was filed in May 2003. The sources of mercury exposure are alleged to be vaccines containing a preservative called thimerosal that were allegedly manufactured and distributed by the drug companies, mercury amalgam dental fillings, and emissions from FPL and OUC power plants in Florida, including Brevard County. The complaint includes counts against all defendants for civil battery and against FPL for alleged negligence in operating the plants such that the son was exposed to mercury and other heavy metals emissions. The damages demanded from FPL are for injuries and losses allegedly suffered by the son as a result of his exposure to the plants mercury emissions and the parents alleged pain and suffering, medical expenses, loss of wages, and loss of their sons services and companionship. No amount of damages is specified. FPL has moved to dismiss the complaint. In July 2003, the Bradstreets brought an identical action in the same court on behalf of themselves and their daughter, Elizabeth Bradstreet. FPL has moved to dismiss the complaint. In June 2003, Monty and Kathryn Wooldridge brought an action on behalf of themselves and their son, Kevin Allen Wooldridge, in the Circuit Court of the 9th Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida, against Aventis Pasteur and a number of other named and unnamed drug manufacturing and distribution companies, the American Dental Association, the Florida Dental Association, FPL and the OUC, alleging that their son has suffered toxic neurological effects from mercury poisoning. The allegations, counts and damages demanded in the complaint are virtually identical to those contained in the Bradstreet lawsuits described above. FPL has moved to dismiss the complaint. In August 2003, Pedro C. and Emilia Roig brought an action on behalf of themselves and their son, Pedro Anthony Roig, in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit in and for Miami Dade County, Florida (the state court), which was removed in October 2003 to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, against Aventis Pasteur and a number of other named and unnamed drug manufacturing and distribution companies and FPL, alleging that their son has suffered toxic neurological effects from mercury poisoning. The allegations, counts and damages demanded in the complaint with respect to FPL are virtually identical to those contained in the Bradstreet and Wooldridge lawsuits described above. The plaintiffs have moved to remand the action back to the state court. The motion has been briefed by both parties and is pending in the U.S. District Court, which has stayed all discovery in the action. FPL will be moving to dismiss the case once the remand motion is decided. In December 2003, Edward and Janis Shiflett brought an action on behalf of themselves and their son, Phillip Benjamin Shiflett, in the Circuit Court of the 18th Judicial Circuit in and for Brevard County, Florida, against Aventis Pasteur and a number of other named and unnamed drug manufacturing and distribution companies, FPL and the OUC, alleging that their son has suffered toxic neurological effects from mercury poisoning. The allegations, counts and damages demanded in the complaint with respect to FPL are virtually identical to those contained in the Bradstreet, Wooldridge and Roig lawsuits. FPL anticipates removing the action to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, and will be moving to dismiss the case. In January 2004, the Center For Biological Diversity, Inc. (Center) filed a lawsuit against FPL Group, FPL Energy and its subsidiaries ESI Bay Area GP, Inc., Green Ridge Power LLC and Altamont Power, LLC, as well as other defendants, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges violations of certain sections of the California Business and Professions Code, unjust enrichment and certain violations of the Lanham Act. The complaint alleges that numerous birds have died as the result of collisions with wind turbines owned and operated by subsidiaries of FPL Energy in the Altamont area. The complaint requests injunctive relief, restitution, penalties, forfeiture of the wind turbines, disgorgement of profits and attorneys fees. As of February 26, 2004, none of the FPL Group related entities named in the lawsuit have been served with this complaint. On February 13, 2004, Albert Litter Studios, Inc. instituted an action against FPL in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit in and for Miami Dade County, Florida, seeking damages on behalf of itself, and purportedly on behalf of all other similarly situated commercial entities in Florida. The plaintiff asserts that FPLs intentional use of allegedly defective thermal demand meters has resulted in overcharging it and certain other commercial customers millions of dollars and constitutes an unfair and or deceptive practice in violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, breach of an implied contract, and in breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $15,000, representing the amount of the alleged overcharges, interest, and such other relief as the court may order. FPL had determined in 2002 that, based on sample testing of the approximately 3,900 1V thermal demand meters in service, the dem and component of its 1V meter population was exceeding allowable tolerance levels established by FPSC rules. In 2002, FPL proposed to replace and test all of the 1V meters in service and to issue refunds, as appropriate, within certain parameters. FPL was given administrative approval from the FPSC staff to proceed with the replacement of the 1V meters. By early 2003, all 1V meters had been replaced. Testing of all 1V meters disclosed that approximately 15% of the 3,900 meters were outside of allowed tolerances, with 10% under registering and 5% over registering electricity usage. In November 2003, the FPSC, as proposed agency action, approved a method for testing the meters and calculating refunds. On December 10, 2003, Southeastern Utility Services, Inc., on behalf of several commercial customers, filed a protest to the proposed agency action and requested a hearing. Southeastern Utility Services, Inc. alleges that, among other things, the p roposed method for computing the amount of the refund is flawed. Discovery is proceeding and no hearing date has been set. In the event that FPL Group and FPL do not prevail in these lawsuits, there may be a material adverse effect on their financial statements. However, FPL Group and FPL believe that they have meritorious defenses to the pending litigation discussed above and are vigorously defending the lawsuits. Management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from the proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the financial statements. In January 2002, Roy Oorbeek and Richard Berman filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against FPL Group (as an individual and nominal defendant); all its current directors (except James L. Camaren, Michael H. Thaman and Frank G. Zarb); certain former directors; and certain current and former officers of FPL Group and FPL, including James L. Broadhead, Lewis Hay III, Dennis P. Coyle, Paul J. Evanson and Lawrence J. Kelleher. In March 2002, William M. Klein, by Stephen S. Klein under power of attorney, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against FPL Group (as nominal defendant); all its current directors (except James L. Camaren, Michael H. Thaman and Frank G. Zarb); certain former directors; and certain current and former officers of FPL Group and FPL, including James L. Broadhead, Paul J. Evanson, Lewis Hay III and Dennis P. Coyle.&nbs p; In February 2003, Donald E. and Judith B. Phillips, represented by the same attorneys who represent Klein, filed suit in the same court against the same defendants as the Klein lawsuit (plus Lawrence J. Kelleher). All three suits have been consolidated. In February 2004, by stipulation of the parties, FPL Group was removed as a defendant. The lawsuits, taken together, allege that the proxy statements relating to shareholder approval of FPL Groups Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and FPL Groups proposed, but unconsummated, merger with Entergy Corporation (Entergy) were false and misleading because they did not affirmatively state that payments made to certain officers under FPL Groups LTIP upon shareholder approval of the merger would be retained by the officers even if the merger with Entergy was not consummated and did not state that under some circumstances payments made pursuant to FPL Groups LTIP might not be deductible by FPL Group for federal income tax purposes. They also allege that FPL Groups LTIP required either consummation of the merger as a condition to the payments or the return of the payments if the transaction did not close, and that the actions of the director defendants in approving the proxy statements, causing the payments to be made, and failing to demand their return const itute corporate waste and a breach of fiduciary duties by those individual defendants. The plaintiffs seek to have the shareholder votes approving FPL Groups LTIP and the merger declared null and void, the return to FPL Group of $62 million of payments received by the officers, compensatory damages of $92 million (including the $62 million of payments received by the officers) from all defendants (except FPL Group) and attorneys fees. A special committee of non management directors of FPL Group conducted an investigation of the claims made in the Oorbeek and Klein lawsuits and reported thereon to FPL Groups board of directors. The report concluded that pursuit of the claims is not in the best interest of FPL Group or its shareholders generally, and recommended that FPL Group seek dismissal of the lawsuits. After reviewing the special committees report, FPL Groups board of directors (with only non management directors participating) concluded likewise and filed with the court a statement of position setting forth the special committees and the boards conclusions and authorizing the filing of a motion to dismiss the lawsuits, which motion was filed in October 2002. Messrs. Zarb, Camaren and Thaman joined the board in August 2002, October 2002 and July 2003, respectively, and did not participate in the proceedings relating to the statement of position or the filing of the motion to dismiss. On January 20, 2004, the court issued an order denying FPL Groups motion to dismiss the lawsuits. FPL Groups above referenced statement of position reported that during the course of the special committees investigation of the allegations in the lawsuits a separate question arose concerning the interpretation of the provisions of FPL Groups LTIP pursuant to which the payments to eight current and former senior officers were calculated. A change from the original interpretation could result in a repayment to FPL Group of up to approximately $9 million. FPL Group and the eight senior officers have entered into a binding arbitration agreement in order to resolve the issue. In May 2003, the plaintiffs attorneys in the Klein lawsuit sent a new letter to FPL Groups board of directors (the May 2003 Letter) demanding, among other things, that the board take action (i) to recover from the persons who approved such payments and or otherwise breached their fiduciary duties, all of the above described $92 million of LTIP payments made to officers and employees of FPL Group, allegedly on the grounds that the payments constituted a breach of fiduciary duty, bad faith, corporate waste and other unspecified wrongs, (ii) to investigate whether the proposed merger with Entergy was a plan by FPL Groups officers and directors to enrich themselves at the expense of the company, (iii) to seek the return of certain LTIP awards made in replacement of accelerated LTIP awards, (iv) to take immediate actions to secure the return of up to approximately $9 million in LTIP payments which is subject to an interpretation question under the LTIP, (v) to investigate and seek the return of stock options a nd restricted stock paid to Mr. Broadhead in January 2002 in connection with a consulting agreement and his retirement from FPL Group in December 2001, and (vi) to investigate whether punitive damages may be sought. In July 2003, FPL Groups board of directors appointed a special committee, composed of James L. Camaren and Michael H. Thaman, to investigate the matters raised in the May 2003 Letter and to make a determination as to how FPL Group should respond to the matters raised therein. In August 2003, the plaintiffs attorney in the Klein lawsuit sent a letter to FPL Groups board of directors purporting to "withdraw" the May 2003 Letter. In addition to those legal proceedings discussed herein, FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are involved in a number of other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of their businesses. In addition, generating plants in which FPL Group or FPL have an ownership interest are involved in legal proceedings and claims, the liabilities from which, if any, would be shared by FPL Group or FPL. While management is unable to predict with certainty the outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims, it is not expected that their ultimate resolution, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on the financial statements. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders None PART II Item 5. Market for the Registrants Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Common Stock Data. All of FPLs common stock is owned by FPL Group. FPL Groups common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The high and low sales prices for the common stock of FPL Group as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system of the New York Stock Exchange for each quarter during the past two years are as follows: 2003 2002 Quarter High Low High Low First $ 63.77 $ 53.55 $ 60.10 $ 51.13 Second $ 68.08 $ 57.74 $ 65.31 $ 56.30 Third $ 67.66 $ 60.01 $ 60.08 $ 45.00 Fourth $ 65.98 $ 62.65 $ 61.40 $ 48.35 Approximate Number of Stockholders. As of the close of business on January 30, 2004, there were 35,076 holders of record of FPL Groups common stock. Dividends. Quarterly dividends have been paid on common stock of FPL Group during the past two years in the following amounts: Quarter 2003 2002 First $ 0.60 $ 0.58 Second $ 0.60 $ 0.58 Third $ 0.60 $ 0.58 Fourth $ 0.60 $ 0.58 The amount and timing of dividends payable on FPL Groups common stock are within the sole discretion of FPL Groups board of directors. The board of directors reviews the dividend rate at least annually (in February) to determine its appropriateness in light of FPL Groups financial position and results of operations, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and FPL in particular, competitive conditions and any other factors the board deems relevant. The ability of FPL Group to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily FPL. In February 2004, FPL Group announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.60 to $0.62 per share. There are no restrictions in effect that currently limit FPLs ability to pay dividends to FPL Group.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. In the discussion of Results of Operations below, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. Results of Operations Overview FPL Groups net income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $890 million, $473 million and $781 million, respectively. See Note 18 for segment information. FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the retail sale of electricity and, in 2003, accounted for more than 80% of FPL Groups net income. FPL Energy derives the majority of its operating revenues through wholesale electricity sales and provided continued growth to FPL Group primarily due to the expansion of its diverse portfolio, industry leading position in wind generation and moderate risk approach. FPL Groups net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 benefited from improved results at both FPL and FPL Energy. FPLs results primarily improved as a result of strong revenue growth from retail base operations. FPL Energys results improved due to over 3,900 mw of new generation capacity being added in 2003 and the absence of certain wr ite offs recorded in 2002. FPL Groups effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 reflects production tax credits for wind projects at FPL Energy. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 was further reduced by the gain from an income tax settlement referenced below. Net income reflects the following items which increased (decreased) reported results: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) FPL: Merger related costs $ $ $ (16 ) FPL Energy: Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ (3 ) $ (222 ) $ Restructuring and other charges $ $ (73 ) $ Unrealized gains from non qualifying hedges $ 22 $ 1 $ 8 Corporate and Other: Impairment, restructuring and other charges $ $ (94 ) $ Gain from income tax settlement $ $ 30 $ Merger related costs $ $ $ (3 ) FPL Groups management uses earnings excluding these items (adjusted earnings) internally for financial planning, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and for FPL Groups employee incentive compensation plan. FPL Group also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. FPL Groups management believes adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded items are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, both the size and nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Beginning in 2002, FPL Group segregated unrealized mark to market gains and losses on derivative transactions into two categories. Prior year amounts were reclassified into these categories. The first category, referred to as trading and managed hedge activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts. The unrealized mark to market gains (losses) from trading and managed hedge activities were $(1) million, $8 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are reported net in operating revenues. The second category, referred to as non qualifying hedges, represents the net unrealized effect of derivative transactions entered into as economic hedges (but which do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended, and do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception) and the ineffective portion of transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges. The unrealized gains from non qualifying hedges were $37 million, $1 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are reported in the same line item as the related realized amounts in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. These transactions have been entered into to reduce FPL Groups aggregate risk. Any position that is moved between non qualifying hedge activity and trading and managed hedge activity is transferred at its fair value on the date of reclassification. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Note 3. In May 2003, FPL Group announced it would begin using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation beginning in 2004. Based on the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2003, the implementation of the fair value based method is expected to reduce FPL Groups net income by approximately $4 million in 2004. See Note 1 Stock Based Compensation. FPL FPLs net income available to FPL Group for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $733 million, $717 million and $679 million, respectively. During 2003, FPLs net income benefited from higher revenues from retail base operations. However, higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes partially offset these higher revenues. FPLs 2003 net income also reflects a loss related to the redemption of preferred stock, which was substantially offset by tax benefits related to the favorable settlement of tax audit issues with the IRS. During 2002, higher revenues from retail base operations and lower depreciation and interest charges were partially offset by higher O&M expenses. Also in 2001, FPL recorded merger related expenses totaling $26 million ($16 million after tax). For additional information regarding merger related expenses, see Note 7. In March 2002, the FPSC approved a new rate agreement regarding FPLs retail base rates, which became effective April 15, 2002 and expires December 31, 2005. The 2002 2005 rate agreement replaced a rate agreement that was effective April 15, 1999 through April 14, 2002. Both agreements include a revenue sharing mechanism for each of the twelve month periods covered by the agreements, whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of a stated threshold are required to be shared on the basis of two thirds refunded to retail customers and one third retained by FPL. Revenues from retail base operations in excess of a second threshold are required to be refunded 100% to retail customers. The 1999 2002 rate agreement allowed FPL at its discretion to recover, as special depreciation, up to $100 million in each year of the three year agreement period. The additional depreciation recovery was required to be applied to nuclear and or fossil generating assets based on future depreciation studies. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. During the term of the agreement, FPLs ROE was from time to time outside the 10% 12% authorized range. However, the revenue sharing mechanism described above was specified as the appropriate and exclusive mechanism to address that circumstance. The agreement included provisions which limited depreciation rates and accruals for nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs to the then approved levels and limited amounts recoverable under the environmental clause during the term of that agreement. The 2002 2005 rate agreement provides for a $250 million annual reduction in retail base revenues allocated to all customers by reducing customers base rates and service charges by approximately 7%. The revenue sharing thresholds specified in the 2002 2005 rate agreement are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2002(a) 2003 2004 2005 (millions) 66 2/3% to customers $ 3,580 $ 3,680 $ 3,780 $ 3,880 100% to customers $ 3,740 $ 3,840 $ 3,940 $ 4,040 (a) Refund was limited to 71.5% (representing the period April 15 through December 31, 2002) of the revenues from base rate operations exceeding the thresholds. During the term of the 2002 2005 rate agreement, FPL will not have an authorized regulatory ROE range for the purpose of addressing earnings levels. However, FPL will continue to file monthly earnings surveillance reports with the FPSC and if the reported ROE falls below 10% during the term of the 2002 2005 rate agreement, FPL may petition the FPSC to amend its base rates. The 2002 2005 rate agreement would terminate on the effective date of any final order issued in a proceeding that changes FPLs base rates. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates. In addition, depreciation rates will not be changed during the term of the agreement; however, FPL will reduce its recorded depreciation expense by $125 million annually. During 2002, FPL reclassified certain amounts that were previously classified within accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability. The reclassifications were made as a result of the terms of the 2002 2 005 rate agreement, as well as other FPSC actions with regard to accumulated nuclear amortization. The amounts reclassified included $170 million of special depreciation and $99 million of nuclear amortization. During 2003 and 2002, FPL credited depreciation expense for $125 million as permitted under the rate agreement. The $125 million annual credit to depreciation went first to offset the $170 million of special depreciation and the remainder to accumulated depreciation. The $99 million of nuclear amortization is being credited to depreciation expense ratably over the remaining life of the plants, based on the term of the existing operating licenses of the plants, at a rate of $7 million per year. The regulatory liability balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002 are included in other liabilities on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 Regulation and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. In April 2002, the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association and certain hospitals filed a joint notice of administrative appeal with the FPSC and the Supreme Court of Florida appealing the FPSCs approval of the 2002 2005 rate agreement. The appellants contend that the FPSC rushed to judgment and approved the settlement without the benefit of any evidentiary record to support its actions, and requested that the Supreme Court remand the case to the FPSC for additional proceedings. In November 2003, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the appeal. There is no specified time by which the Supreme Court of Florida must rule. FPL intends to continue to vigorously contest this appeal and believes that the FPSCs decision approving the 2002 2005 rate agreement will be upheld. FPLs operating revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) Retail base operations $ 3,680 $ 3,603 $ 3,616 Revenue refund provision (3 ) (34 ) (110 ) Cost recovery clauses and other pass through costs 4,558 3,793 3,955 Other 58 16 16 Total $ 8,293 $ 7,378 $ 7,477 For the year ended December 31, 2003, the increase in retail base revenues was primarily due to an increase in customer accounts and an increase in usage per retail customer. The increase in 2003 was partially offset by the effect of the 7% base reduction in retail rates, or $62 million, pursuant to the 2002 2005 rate agreement that was effective in mid April 2002. A 2.4% increase in the number of retail customer accounts increased revenues by $85 million, while the balance of the increase, or $54 million, was primarily due to a 1.7% increase in usage per retail customer. Based upon econometric models, management estimates about half of the growth in usage for the year was associated with higher per capita income and the remainder is due to weather related usage and price elasticity associated with lower rates. The increase in retail base revenues in 2002 (net of the revenue refund provision discussed above) was due to a 2.1% increase in retail customer accounts which contributed $78 million to revenues while the balance of the increase, or $112 million, was primarily due to a 3.5% increase in electricity usage per retail customer. The 7% rate reduction caused a $203 million reduction in retail base revenues. Revenues from cost recovery clauses and other pass through costs, such as franchise fees and revenue taxes, do not significantly affect net income; however, under or over recovery of such costs can significantly affect FPL Groups and FPLs operating cash flows. Fluctuations in these revenues, as well as in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are primarily driven by changes in energy sales, fuel prices and capacity charges. Ordinarily, the fuel charge is set annually based on estimated fuel costs and estimated customer usage, plus or minus a true up for prior period estimates. During 2003, the FPSC approved fuel adjustment increases of $347 million effective April 1, 2003 and $214 million effective July 31, 2003 both of which were recovered in 2003. These increases were due to higher than projected oil and natural gas prices. During 2002, the FPSC approved a risk management fuel procurement program which became effective January 1, 2003. The program is intended to reduce the risk of unexpected fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. The results of the program are reviewed by the FPSC as part of the annual review of fuel costs. The increase in revenues from cost recovery clauses and other pass through costs for the year ended December 31, 2003, was primarily due to higher fuel costs. Higher than projected fuel costs resulted in an underrecovery, which increased deferred clause expenses on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets and negatively affected FPL Groups and FPLs cash flows from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. During 2002, clause revenues (primarily fuel related) declined due to lower fuel costs. FPLs annual fuel filing for 2001, as approved by the FPSC, included approximately $518 million of under recovered fuel costs from 2000, of which one half ($259 million) was recovered in 2001 and the balanc e was recovered in 2002. FPL agreed to this two year recovery, rather than the typical one year time frame, to ease the impact on customers bills. FPL also agreed that, instead of receiving a return at the commercial paper rate through the fuel clause, the under recovery would be included as a rate base regulatory asset over the two year recovery period. See Note 1 Regulation. FPLs O&M expenses increased $25 million in 2003 primarily due to a $29 million increase in nuclear maintenance expenses associated with more comprehensive inspections of the reactor vessel heads at FPLs nuclear facilities as ordered by the NRC, as well as increased outage and plant maintenance costs. In 2003, the NRC issued an order, subsequent to a previously issued NRC bulletin, requiring all pressurized water reactor licensees, including FPL, to perform visual and volumetric inspections of reactor vessel heads at each units scheduled refueling outage to identify if degradation such as cracking or corrosion has occurred. During the scheduled refueling outages for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 in October 2002, Turkey Point Unit No. 3 in March 2003 and Turkey Point Unit No. 4 in October 2003, FPL performed visual and volumetric inspections and found no degradation associated with the reactor vessel heads. In late April and early May 2003, while volumetric inspections of the rea ctor vessel head at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 were being performed during a scheduled refueling outage, two CRDM nozzles were found with one small crack in each. Both cracks were less than 50% through the thickness of the CRDM nozzle. No leakage was observed and both cracks were repaired during the outage. Also during the St. Lucie Unit No. 2 scheduled refueling outage, the steam generators were inspected and more tubes had to be plugged than anticipated. The inspection results were evaluated and revised tube plugging projections developed. Management intends to replace the steam generators at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2007 and will delay the reactor vessel head replacement for St. Lucie Unit No. 2 until 2007 to coincide with the steam generator replacement. FPL anticipates replacing the reactor vessel heads at Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 during their next scheduled refueling outage and at St. Lucie Unit No. 1 during a scheduled refueling ou tage in the fall of 2005. Reactor vessel head replacements for these three units are expected to add approximately 35 days to the number of days a unit is removed from service during a typical scheduled refueling outage. The cost for the reactor vessel heads and steam generators is estimated to be $525 million and is included in FPLs estimated capital expenditures. See Note 17 Commitments. The cost of performing inspections and any necessary repairs until the reactor vessel heads are replaced is being recognized as expense on a levelized basis over a five year period beginning in 2002, as authorized by the FPSC, and amounted to $13 million in each of 2003 and 2002. In 2003, the NRC issued a bulletin recommending that utilities with bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations perform visual inspections. Visual inspections of the bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations were performed in 2003 during Turkey Point Unit No. 4s scheduled refueling outage, and no evidence of leakage from these penetrations was noted. A visual inspection of Turkey Point Unit No. 3s bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations will be performed at its next scheduled refueling outage in the fall of 2004. St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 do not have bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations. In addition to the increase in nuclear O&M expenses in 2003, employee benefit costs, primarily medical related, increased $17 million and property and liability insurance costs increased $17 million due to higher insurance premiums combined with lower refunds under nuclear insurance policies. These cost pressures are expected to continue in 2004. The 2003 cost increases were partially offset by the absence of the storm fund accrual of $35 million (discussed below) recorded in 2002, as well as productivity improvements in other areas. FPLs O&M expenses increased $143 million in 2002. Approximately $42 million was attributable to higher nuclear costs associated with more comprehensive inspections of the reactor vessel heads at FPLs nuclear facilities. In addition to the increase in nuclear O&M expenses in 2002, employee benefit costs increased $15 million and property insurance costs increased $9 million. Also in December 2002, the FPSC approved a one t ime $35 million addition to the storm fund reserve. The balance of the increase in 2002 O&M expenses primarily related to costs associated with work force reductions, overhaul of fossil plants and system reliability efforts. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $831 million in 2002 to $898 million in 2003 primarily due to FPLs investment in generation and distribution expansion to support customer growth and demand which included the completion of the Fort Myers and Sanford repowering projects. The decrease in depreciation expense during 2002 reflects the $125 million credit to depreciation expense authorized under the 2002 2005 rate agreement. This credit was partially offset by higher depreciation expense associated with the amortization of a regulatory asset recorded as a result of a litigation settlement. The amortization approximates $44 million annually and is being recovered over a 5 year period, beginning in January 2002, through the fuel and capacity clauses. The Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 received operating license extensions in 2002, which give FPL the option to operate these units until 2032 and 2033, respectively. The NRC extended the operating licenses for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 during 2003, which give FPL the option to operate these units until 2036 and 2043, respectively. The original license expiration dates for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 and for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 are 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2023, respectively. FPL has not yet decided to exercise the option to operate past the original license expiration dates, although FPL is continuing to take actions to ensure the long term viability of the units in order to preserve this option. The decision will be made for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 by 2007 and for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 by 2011. Any adjustment to depreciation and decommissioning rates would require FPSC approval. Interest charges for 2003 increased primarily due to higher average debt balances used to fund increased investment in generation, transmission and distribution expansion and under recovery of fuel costs. This increase was partially offset by a decline in average interest rates of approximately 80 basis points in 2003 as compared to 2002. In 2002, the decrease in interest charges was primarily due to lower average interest rates, as well as lower average debt balances as a result of the recovery of previously under recovered fuel costs. FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers. In 2003, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 4% of FPLs total operating revenues. Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier. This regulatory restructuring is expected to result in a shift from cost based rates to market based rates for energy production and other services provided to retail customers. Although the legislation and initiatives vary substantially, common areas of focus include when market based pricing will be available for wholesale and retail customers, what existing prudently incurred costs in excess of the market based price will be recoverable and wheth er generating assets should be separated from transmission, distribution and other assets. It is generally believed transmission and distribution activities would remain regulated. Recently, these state restructuring efforts have diminished, and several states have delayed the implementation or reversed previously approved restructuring legislation and rules. Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the electric industry in Florida in the near future. The FPSC promotes competition for building major new steam generating capacity by requiring investor owned electric utilities, such as FPL, to issue an RFP. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the needed generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and or operating generation capacity of the type proposed, the investor owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a power purchase agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC authorize the construction of the bidders generation capacity under the terms of the power purchase agreement. In 2003, FPL issued an RFP for additional power resources of approximately 1,100 mw beginning in June 2007. In January 2004, after evaluating alternative proposals, FPL concluded that its plan to build a new natural gas fired plant at its Turkey Point site was the best and most cost effective option to provide the 1,100 mw. In March 2004, FPL plans to file a petition for approval of this alternative with the FPSC. A decision is expected by mid 2004. This alternative will also be subject to approval by a Siting Board (comprised of the governor and cabinet) under the Florida Electrical Power Plant Siting Act. The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes which could affect competition in wholesale transactions. In 1999, the FERC issued its final order on RTOs which, under a variety of structures, provides for the independent operation of transmission systems for a given geographic area. In March 2001, the FERC approved GridFlorida (FPLs, Progress Energy Florida, Inc.s and Tampa Electric Companys proposed RTO) as the RTO for peninsular Florida. In December 2001, the FPSC determined that the RTO as proposed was not in the best interest of Florida customers and required the companies to develop a modified proposal. In March 2002, FPL, Progress Energy Florida, Inc. and Tampa Electric Company filed a modified RTO proposal with the FPSC changing the structure of GridFlorida from a for profit transmission company to a non profit ISO. Under the proposal, FPL would continue to own its transmission lines and the ISO would manage t hem. In September 2002, the FPSC approved many of the aspects of the modified RTO proposal, allowing recovery of GridFloridas incremental costs through the capacity clause. In October 2002, the Public Counsel filed a notice of administrative appeal with the Supreme Court of Florida seeking an appeal of the FPSCs order. In June 2003, the Florida Supreme Court dismissed the Public Counsels appeal of the FPSCs approval of GridFlorida without prejudice concluding that the appeal was premature because the FPSC proceedings had not yet been completed and not all aspects of the FPSCs order on appeal were considered final agency action. The FPSC has restored the GridFlorida docket to active status and in December 2003 issued a procedural order establishing a series of workshops through 2004 to address GridFlorida issues. In July 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to reform public utilities transmission tariffs and implement a standardized design for electric markets in the United States. The proposed rule would, among other things, require FERC regulated entities, including FPL, that own, control or operate transmission facilities to hire an independent transmission provider, which can be an RTO such as GridFlorida for the operation of those facilities. The proposed rule also will require the independent transmission provider to administer various spot markets for the sale of electricity and ancillary services and to manage congestion on the transmission system using financial congestion rights. Legislators and regulators from the southeast and western states have expressed strong reservations about the FERCs proposal. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper responding to comments on its proposed rule.&nb sp; The White Paper indicates that the FERC intends to be more flexible on how and when the final rule will be implemented, defer to regional state committees to address significant RTO/ISO features, require regulated utilities to join RTOs or ISOs and require RTOs to implement spot markets. While a moratorium on further action by the FERC was included in the proposed Energy Policy Act, the status of that legislation is uncertain. FPL is evaluating the proposed FERC rule and is currently unable to determine its effects, if any, on FPLs operations. In the event the basis of regulation for some or all of FPLs business changes from cost based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment. See Note 1 Regulation. In addition, FPL is constructing approximately 1,900 mw of natural gas combined cycle generation at its Martin and Manatee sites with a planned in service date of June 2005. In January 2003, CPV Gulfcoast, Ltd. filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Florida challenging the FPSCs 2002 approval of the Martin and Manatee expansion and in April 2003, filed its initial brief. In May 2003, FPL filed its answer brief, which included a request for dismissal. The Supreme Court of Florida will not hold oral arguments. There is no specified time by which the Supreme Court of Florida must rule. FPL Energy FPL Energys net income (loss) for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $194 million, $(169) million and $113 million, respectively. FPL Energys net income has become a greater portion of FPL Groups consolidated net income increasing from 1% in 1997 to 22% in 2003. Net income reflects the following items which increased (decreased) reported results: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ (3 ) $ (222 ) $ Restructuring and other charges $ $ (73 ) $ Unrealized gains from non qualifying hedges $ 22 $ 1 $ 8 Net income for 2003 included a charge of $3 million after tax due to a change in accounting principle (see Note 10) and a net unrealized gain of $22 million after tax associated with the mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges. The net loss for 2002 was the result of FPL Energy recording impairment and other charges totaling $485 million ($295 million after tax). The impairment and other charges consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of $365 million ($222 million after tax) representing the cumulative effect of adopting FAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and restructuring and other charges totaling $120 million ($73 million after tax) due to the unfavorable market conditions in the wholesale energy market. For further discussion of FAS 142, see Note 5, and for the restructuring and other charges, see below. In addition, during 2002, FPL Energy recorded less than $1 million of after tax net unrealized mark to market gain s from non qualifying hedges compared to gains of $8 million during 2001. For further discussion of derivative instruments, see Note 3. In 2002, as a result of depressed economic conditions coupled with an oversupply of energy generating facilities in certain markets, projected profit margins for certain natural gas projects had declined and were not sufficient to cover the cost of capital. Therefore, FPL Energy made a strategic decision during 2002 to substantially exit the fossil fueled greenfield merchant power plant development business for the foreseeable future and, as a result, recorded restructuring and impairment charges in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income totaling $103 million ($63 million after tax). See Note 6 FPL Energy. Also in 2002, FPL Energy recorded a charge of approximately $17 million ($10 million after tax) against its investment in two wind projects due to regulatory issues associated with another investor in the projects. The resulting expense is included in equity in earnings of equity method investees in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. After resolving the regulatory issues, in December 2003, FPL Energy purchased the remaining interests in these wind projects and began consolidating their operations. FPL Energys 2003 net income benefited from the full year effect of 2,235 mw of generation added in 2002, the majority of which was added in the fourth quarter of 2002, as well as 3,904 mw added in 2003. The 2002 additions include the purchase of an 88.23% interest in Seabrook as well as wind and natural gas fired assets. During 2003, FPL Energy added 975 mw of wind generation and 2,929 mw of natural gas fired assets. In aggregate, 2002 and 2003 project additions contributed $82 million to 2003 net income. FPL Energys operating revenues and operating expenses for the year ended 2003 increased $561 million and $352 million, respectively, primarily driven by project additions. In addition, restructuring and impairment charges discussed above added $103 million to operating expenses in 2002. Operating revenues net of operating expenses, primarily fuel, were essentially flat in the balance of the portfolio. & nbsp;Both the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions experienced higher energy prices offset by lower generation and higher fuel costs. Construction is underway on another gas fired power plant that will add 744 mw of generation in PJM in the last half of 2004. FPL Energy expects its future portfolio growth to come from a mix of asset acquisitions and wind development, assuming pending legislation reestablishing the production tax credits for new wind facilities is enacted. Earnings from investments in partnerships and joint ventures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, presented as equity in earnings of equity method investees, increased $13 million from the prior year reflecting an increase in unrealized gains associated with the mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges and a $17 million charge against its investment in two wind projects recorded in 2002 (discussed above). In addition, equity in earnings of equity method investees reflects lower gains from contract restructurings and lower earnings from a project in California, as well as lower project earnings due to higher fuel prices in the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions. FPL Energys net income for the year ended 2003 also reflected higher interest expense of approximately $38 million associated with increasing average debt balances due to growth in the business partially offset by a decline in average interest rates of approximately 30 basis points compared with same period in 2002. FPL Energys net income in 2002 also included the positive effects of a $10 million insurance settlement. In 2003, the NRC issued an order, subsequent to a previously issued NRC bulletin, requiring all pressurized water reactor licensees, including Seabrook, to perform visual and volumetric inspections of reactor vessel heads to identify if degradation such as cracking or corrosion has occurred. Seabrook will be required to perform 100% visual and volumetric inspections in 2006, and subsequently, visual inspections every third outage and volumetric inspections every fourth outage. In 2003, the NRC issued a bulletin recommending that utilities with bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations perform visual inspections. In October 2003, visual inspections of the bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations were performed during Seabrooks scheduled refueling outage, and no evidence of leakage from these penetrations was noted. The next refueling outage is scheduled to be performed in April 2005. FPL Energys 2002 net income benefited from project additions, primarily wind assets in the central and western regions of the United States, and the purchase of an 88.23% interest in Seabrook in November 2002, as well as a natural gas fired power plant that began operations during the fourth quarter of 2002. Project additions totaling more than 1,000 mw in 2001 and more than 2,200 mw in 2002 contributed $41 million to 2002 net income, $22 million coming from the full year effect of new wind projects that came on line in the second half of 2001 and 324 mw of new wind generation added in 2002, and the balance from earnings from other project additions, including Seabrook. For additional information concerning the Seabrook acquisition, see Note 9 FPL Energy. FPL Energys operating revenues and operating expenses for 2002 increased $80 million and $220 million, respectively, primarily driven by project additions coupled with the previously disc ussed restructuring charges that added $103 million to operating expenses in 2002. Increased revenues from project additions were partially offset by lower revenues from the balance of the consolidated portfolio primarily due to reduced energy prices driven by new entrants in the market, as well as mild weather in the Northeast, including drought conditions which had a negative impact on the performance of the hydro assets. Earnings from investments in partnerships and joint ventures, presented as equity in earnings of equity method investees, declined $5 million in 2002 reflecting the $17 million charge recorded against investments in two wind projects discussed above and a gain of $23 million on the restructuring of a gas supply contract that was renegotiated to yield lower fuel costs and is expected to improve future cash flows, as well as improve equity in earnings from the project. In addition, equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2001 included a gain of $34 million resulting from the sale of a partnership interest in a geothermal project. This gain was almost entirely offset by the write off of affiliate debt associated with the partnership interest, which was included in other net. The remaining increase in 2002 equity in earnings is primarily due to increased contract prices, as the majority of the output of the projects was sold under long term contracts. Interest charges increased $12 million during 2002 associated with higher debt balances due to growth in the business, partly offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income in 2002 declined approximately $14 million and includes, in 2001, interest from a favorable settlement with the IRS. In addition, the decline in interest income reflects lower interest rates in 2002. Over the last several years, there has been a general decline in the wholesale energy market, including deterioration in forward prices and reduced liquidity, as well as increasing credit concerns that have limited the number of counterparties with which FPL Energy does business. These market conditions have made it more difficult for FPL Energy to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices, to optimize the value of its assets and to contract the output of its plants. Any uncontracted output from the plants has been and will be sold into the market place at prevailing prices when economical. Given current market conditions, when FPL Energys existing power sales agreements expire, more of the energy produced may be sold through shorter term contracts and into competitive wholesale markets. Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary by geographic region. Expanded competition in a relaxed regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for FPL Energy. Some of the factors affecting success in these markets are the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth and exposure to legal and regulatory changes. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets divested under deregulation plans and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets. Wholesale energy markets have experienced lower demand and lower wholesale electricity prices as a result of weather and economic conditions and the oversupply of generation in certain regions. FPL Energy seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio, by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants. FPL Energys 2004 earnings are subject to variability due to, among other things, commodity price exposure, counterparty performance, weather conditions and project restructuring activities. FPL Energys exposure to commodity price risk is reduced by the high degree of contract coverage obtained for 2004. As of December 31, 2003, FPL Energys capacity under contract for 2004 is as follows: Asset Class Available MW (a) % MW Under Contract Wind 2,719 99 % Non wind assets under long term contract 1,255 98 % Merchants: Seabrook 1,024 97 % NEPOOL/PJM/NYPP 1,879 34 % (b) ERCOT 3,009 65 % (b) Other (WECC/SERC) 1,345 60 % (b) Total portfolio 11,231 74 % (a) Weighted to reflect in service dates and planned maintenance. (b) Represents on peak mw under contract. FPL Energys results are affected by natural fluctuations in weather. In addition to the effect of temperature, which is reflected in commodity prices and demand, changes in weather affect the wind portfolio as well as the hydro units in Maine. In managing its exposure to commodity prices, FPL Energy is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations. FPL Energy actively manages the trade off between market risk and credit risk, as well as exposure with individual counterparties as a function of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of FPL Energys 2004 contracted revenues are with investment grade counterparties. Corporate and Other Corporate and Others net loss for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $37 million, $75 million and $11 million, respectively. Net loss reflects the following items which increased (decreased) reported results: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) Impairment, restructuring and other charges $ $ (94 ) $ Gain from income tax settlement $ $ 30 $ Merger related costs $ $ $ (3 ) Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of FPL FiberNet and other corporate income and expenses, such as interest income and interest expense. Results from Corporate and Other for 2003 primarily reflect higher interest charges and the absence of restructuring and impairment charges recorded in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, losses at Corporate and Other reflect impairment and other charges totaling $94 million after tax as a result of declines in the telecommunications market (see Note 6 Corporate and Other) and reserves against certain leveraged lease investments (see Note 17 Other Contingencies). These charges were partially offset by a $30 million gain in the first quarter of 2002 from the resolution of an income tax matter. The impairment and other charges were recorded as a result of declines in the telecommunications market. FPL FiberNet completed valuation studies to assess the recoverability of its assets and as a result, in 2002, recorded charges of approximately $104 million ($64 million after tax). Of this amount, $85 million ($52 million after tax) represents an impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment, the fair value of which was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, FPL FiberNet decided not to pursue the planned build out of metro fiber rings in certain cities, and restructuring charges of $19 million ($12 million after tax) were recognized related to the write off of development costs and inventory. These charges are included in restructuring and impairment charges in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. Although the demand for telecommunication capacity continues to grow, many telecommunication companies have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 11) as market conditions deteriorated. This has caused customer credit to become a primary focus for the industry as credit downgrades have increased. Most of FPL FiberNets customers are required to pay in advance and past due amounts are closely monitored and actively pursued. Several of FPL FiberNets customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 and reserves for any prepetition receivables due to FPL FiberNet have been established. As a result of this deterioration and general economic conditions, FPL FiberNet has experienced a slowdown in its longhaul (intercity transport) business. FPL FiberNets metropolitan network continues to benefit from an expanding customer base and increasing use of FPL FiberNets network by it s existing customers. FPL FiberNets capital expenditure forecast for 2004 2008 is approximately $50 million. Subsidiaries of FPL Group, other than FPL, have investments in several leveraged leases, two of which are with MCI Telecommunications Corporation (MCI). In July 2002, MCI filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. Due to the uncertainty of collectibility associated with these leveraged leases, FPL Group recorded reserves totaling approximately $48 million ($30 million after tax) in the third quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2003, investments in leveraged leases with MCI totaled approximately $15 million and related deferred tax liabilities totaled approximately $11 million. An agreement has been reached with MCI that will consolidate and amend the leases upon the effective date of MCIs reorganization plan. On September 2, 2003, MCI was authorized by the bankruptcy court to assume the consolidated and amended lease, cure any prepetition arrearages and take all further action necessary or appropriate to effectuate t he amended lease upon the effective date of MCIs reorganization plan. The amended lease would be classified as an operating lease and is not expected to have a significant effect on FPL Groups financial statements. In October 2003, the bankruptcy court approved MCIs reorganization plan which is expected to become effective in early 2004. In connection with the redemption in 1999 of its one third ownership interest in Olympus Communications, L.P. (Olympus), an indirect subsidiary of FPL Group holds a note receivable from a limited partnership, of which Olympus is a general partner. The note receivable is secured by a pledge of the redeemed ownership interest. Olympus is an indirect subsidiary of Adelphia Communications Corp. (Adelphia). In June 2002, Adelphia and a number of its subsidiaries, including Olympus, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The note receivable plus accrued interest totaled approximately $127 million at December 31, 2003 and are included in other investments on FPL Groups consolidated balance sheets. The note was due on July 1, 2002 and is currently in default. Based on the most recent publicly available financial information set forth in Olympus Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2001, total assets of Olympus exceeded liabilities by approximately $3.6 billion and Olympus served 1,787,000 basic subscribers. Olympus has not filed its Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 or any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q or Annual Reports on Form 10 K with the SEC, and consequently the September 30, 2001 financial information may not be indicative of Olympus current financial position. Olympus has stated publicly that it expects to restate its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, and its interim financial statements for 2001 and possibly other periods. In addition, current management of Olympus believes that other public information provided by the Rigas family, which controlled Adelphia, was unrel iable. In July 2002, the SEC filed suit against Adelphia and certain of its officers alleging that Adelphia fraudulently excluded billions of dollars of debt from its financial statements, misstated its financial and operating results and concealed rampant self dealing by the Rigas family. In October 2003, Olympus filed certain limited financial information as required by orders of the bankruptcy court. However, such information was not useful to FPL Group in its evaluation of the collectibility of the note receivable. In January 2004, the FPL Group subsidiary filed its proof of claims with the bankruptcy court. In August 2002, an affidavit was filed in the bankruptcy court proceedings by a director of Lazard Freres & Co. LLC stating that, based on his analysis, the market value of FPL Groups secured interest in Olympus exceeded the carrying value of the note receivable plus accrued interest. In February 2003, FPL Group obtained an evaluation of the Olympus assets from an independent third party. The results of the evaluation, which was based on the limited information available, indicated that there was no impairment. On February 25, 2004, Adelphia and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Olympus, filed a disclosure statement (Disclosure Statement) and plan of reorganization (Plan). The Disclosure Statement provides for the "deemed consolidation" of the Adelphia debtors into ten separate groups for purposes of voting, confirmation and distribution under the Plan. The note receivable has been classified under the Plan by the Adelphia debtors as one of those groups and, under the proposed treatment under the Plan, the note receivable will be satisfied with shares of common stock of a reorganized Adelphia. FPL Group believes that the Disclosure Statement and the Plan have misclassified the note receivable and anticipates filing appropriate objections. FPL Group cannot predict whether its objection to the Plan will result in changes to the Plan or whether the Plan will be approved. As such, the ultimate collectibility of the note receivable cannot be assured. Liquidity and Capital Resources FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, to pay maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, to redeem outstanding debt and preferred stock. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated funds and the issuance, from time to time, of debt and equity securities, consistent with FPL Groups and FPLs objective of maintaining, on a long term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. Credit ratings can affect FPL Groups and FPLs ability to obtain short and long term financing, the cost of such financing and the execution of their financing strategies. Absent new investment opportunities in 2004, management expects cash to be available to FPL Group in e xcess of needs that are presently identified. FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have $3.0 billion ($2.0 billion for FPL Group Capital and $1.0 billion for FPL) of bank lines of credit currently available. Half of these credit facilities expire in October 2004 with a one year term out option. The other half of the credit facilities expire in October 2006 and provide for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $500 million for FPL Group Capital and up to $250 million for FPL subject to the aggregate commitment ($1.0 billion for FPL Group Capital and $500 million for FPL) under the applicable facility. These credit facilities are available to support the companies commercial paper programs and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a Transmission and Distribution property loss (in the case of FPL), as well as for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2003, letters of credit totaling $85 million and $0 were outstanding under the FPL Group Capital and FPL credit facilities, respectively. In addition, FPL Group Capital and FPL each have a promissory note with a bank under which they may borrow up to $200 million and $500 million, respectively. Borrowings under both promissory notes may be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2003, FPL Group Capital had $200 million outstanding under its promissory note and is included in notes payable on FPL Groups consolidated balance sheets. FPL had no amounts outstanding under its promissory note. FPL Group (which guarantees payment of FPL Group Capitals credit facilities and promissory note) is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to capitalization and a minimum interest coverage ratio under the terms of FPL Group Capitals credit facilities. FPL is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to capitalization under FPLs credit facilities. At December 31, 2003, FPL Group and FPL were in compliance with their respective ratios. During 2003, FPL Group and its subsidiaries obtained debt financing totaling approximately $3.1 billion; approximately $894 million at FPL, $1.1 billion at FPL Group Capital and $1.1 billion at FPL Energy. During 2003, FPL Group also raised approximately $73 million of equity through its dividend reinvestment plan and employee thrift plans. The proceeds from FPLs debt were used to repay a portion of short term borrowings, redeem higher interest rate debt and for other corporate purposes. In addition, FPL redeemed preferred stock with an aggregate par value of $221 million during 2003. FPL Group Capitals debt proceeds were used to repay a portion of commercial paper issued to fund investments in independent power projects. Subsidiaries of FPL Energy that issued debt used the proceeds to either fund, or return to FPL Energy a portion of the indirect investment it made for the development, acquisition and or construction o f independent power projects, as well as to fund operations and debt service. In addition, effective July 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL consolidated certain VIEs in accordance with FIN 46. FPL consolidated $135 million of 2.34% senior secured notes maturing in June 2006. The notes were issued by a VIE in June 2003 and the proceeds were used by the VIE to refinance its existing debt and for the procurement of nuclear fuel and related general corporate purposes. In 2003, this consolidated VIE also established a $65 million senior secured revolving credit facility which expires in June 2004 to provide backup support to the VIEs commercial paper program. FPL has provided an unconditional guarantee of the payment obligations of the VIE under the notes and credit facility, which are included in the table of commitments below. At December 31, 2003, the VIE had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately $19 million under the commercial paper program. In additio n, FPL Energy consolidated approximately $360 million variable rate notes payable issued by a VIE in June 2002 and maturing in December 2007. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the notes payable was approximately $356 million. The proceeds of the notes were used by the VIE to complete the acquisition, development and construction of a power generation plant. FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain obligations under the debt agreement. This VIE also entered into two identical interest rate swap agreements in 2002 with an aggregate original notional amount of $106 million to fix the interest rate on a portion of this debt at 4.41%. The interest rate swap agreements expire in December 2007. Quarterly principal payments on the notes began in March 2003. For further discussion of VIEs, see Note 10. FPL Group and its subsidiaries also entered into five interest rate swap agreements during 2003. The swaps consisted of three variable interest rate swap agreements at FPL Group Capital to protect $475 million of its outstanding fixed rate debentures (with interest rates ranging from 6 7/8% to 7 5/8%) against changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates and two interest rate swap agreements at FPL Energy to fix the interest rates at rates ranging from 3.557% to 4.245% in order to limit cash flow exposure on a total of $294 million of variable rate debt. In January 2004, FPL sold 200,000 shares of $100 par value 4 1/2% Series V preferred stock to FPL Group and issued $240 million of 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035. Also in January 2004, FPL Group Capital entered into a variable interest rate swap agreement to protect $200 million of its outstanding 1 7/8% fixed rate debentures against changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates. For further discussion of preferred stock and debt activity, see Notes 14 and 15, respectively. The following provides various metrics regarding FPL Group and FPLs outstanding debt: FPL Group FPL December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2003 2002 Weighted average annual interest rate 4.9 % 5.5 % 4.5 % 5.3 % Weighted average life (years) (a) 7.3 6.0 13.6 10.1 Annual average of floating rate debt to total debt 31 % 29 % 33 % 34 % (a) For comparability purposes, 2002 reflects debt related to VIEs consolidated July 1, 2003. FPL Groups charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of FPL Group to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily FPL. In February 2004, FPL Group announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.60 to $0.62 per share. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, FPL paid, as dividends to FPL Group, its net income available to FPL Group on a one month lag basis. In addition in 2002, FPL paid special dividends totaling $375 million to FPL Group. FPL Group made capital contributions in 2003, 2002 and 2001 to FPL of $600 million, $350 million and $400 million, respectively. FPLs charter and mortgage contain provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to FPL Group and the issuance of additional unsecured debt, preferred stock and first mortg age bonds. In light of FPLs current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations. Under FPLs charter, dividends may be paid on FPLs common stock only after payment or provision for payment of dividends which are then accrued and owing on FPLs preferred stock, and only to the extent that the payment of such common stock dividends would not cause the common stock equity to be less than 25% of total capitalization of FPL or, if the common stock equity would be less than 20% or 25%, as the case may be, of the total capitalization of FPL, then such dividends may not exceed 50% or 75%, respectively, of the net income of FPL for the preceding 12 months available for dividends on the common stock. Under this test, FPL could have paid dividends in excess of $3 billion at December 31, 2003 after giving effect to the January 2004 issuances of the 200,000 shares of $100 par value 4 1/2% Series V preferred stock and the $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035. Under the mortgage securing FPLs first mortgage bonds, in some case s, the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPLs use of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2003, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage. While FPLs preferred stock remains outstanding, FPLs charter limits the amount of its unsecured indebtedness (without the consent of the preferred shareholders), for purposes other than (a) the refunding of outstanding unsecured indebtedness; (b) the reacquisition, redemption or other retirement of any indebtedness issued or assumed by FPL; or (c) the reacquisition, redemption or other retirement of all outstanding shares of FPLs outstanding preferred stock and all outstanding shares of any other class or series of stock ranking on a parity with the outstanding preferred stock. For other purposes, the allowed aggregate principal amount of unsecured indebtedness is 20% of the aggregate of the total principal amount of all bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness issued or assumed by FPL and the capital and surplus of FPL. Under this test after giving effect to the January 2004 issuance of $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds matur ing in 2035, FPL could have issued in excess of $450 million of additional unsecured debt at December 31, 2003 for purposes other than those described above. Under FPLs charter, the issuance of additional shares of FPL preferred stock (except junior preferred) is prohibited unless (a) net income available for payment of dividends on all the preferred stock including the shares to be issued for a period of 12 consecutive months within the last 15 months immediately preceding the issuance is at least twice the annual dividend requirements on all the preferred stock including the shares to be issued; and (b) gross income (after depreciation and taxes) for a period of 12 consecutive months within the 15 months immediately prior to such issuance shall have been at least 1.5 times the sum of annual interest charges on all indebtedness and annual dividend requirements on all the preferred stock (including the shares to be issued). Currently, the gross income test is the more restrictive of the two tests, and under that test, after giving effect to the January 2004 issuances of the 200,000 shares of $100 par value 4 1/2% Serie s V preferred stock and the $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 would have been in excess of 4 times the sum of annual interest charges on all indebtedness and annual dividend requirements on all the preferred stock. FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPLs first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior FPL indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, after giving effect to the January 2004 issuance of the $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003, would have been in excess of 9 times the annual interest requirements and in excess of 5 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. As of December 31, 2003, after giving effect to the issuance in January 2004 of the $240 million of 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035, FPL could have issued in excess of $4.5 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.5 billion based on retired first mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2003, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes. FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of debt outstanding. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities maintained by FPL Group Capital and FPL, the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating is not a condition to drawing upon those credit facilities. However, commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings and would increase or decrease when ratings are changed. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities, and could result in the requirement that FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, post collateral under certain power purchase and other agreements. FPL G roup subsidiaries, including FPL, are regularly required to post collateral in excess of collateral threshold amounts when FPL Groups exposure to the counterparty under the applicable trading agreement exceeds such threshold. Securities of FPL Group and its subsidiaries are currently rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). At February 26, 2004, Moodys, S&P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital: FPL Group: Moodys (a) S&P (a) Fitch (a) Corporate credit rating N/A A A FPL: Corporate credit rating A1 A/A 1 N/A First mortgage bonds Aa3 A AA Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds Aa3/VMIG 1 A/A 1 A+ Preferred stock A3 BBB+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 FPL Group Capital: Corporate credit rating N/A A/A 1 N/A Debentures A2 A A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 (a) A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The outlook indicated by Moodys for the ratings of FPL is stable, while the outlook for the ratings of FPL Group Capital is negative reflecting uncertainty in the wholesale generation market. In July 2003, Fitch initiated coverage of FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital and indicated a stable outlook for each company. In October 2003, S&P affirmed the "A" corporate credit rating for FPL Group and subsidiaries and maintained a negative outlook. FPL Groups commitments by segment at December 31, 2003 were as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (millions) Long term debt: FPL $ $ 500 $ 135 $ $ 200 $ 2,258 $ 3,093 FPL Energy 91 119 116 418 315 705 1,764 Corporate and Other 276 675 1,100 1,075 506 630 4,262 Standby letters of credit: FPL 11 11 FPL Energy 291 291 Corporate and Other 4 4 Guarantees: FPL FPL Energy 62 95 17 220 394 Corporate and Other 2 2 Other commitments: FPL (a) 1,645 1,650 1,565 1,540 1,230 7,630 FPL Energy (b) 171 69 49 64 47 717 1,117 Corporate and Other (c) 157 46 203 Total $ 2,708 $ 3,156 $ 2,965 $ 3,114 $ 2,298 $ 4,530 $ 18,771 (a) Represents estimated capital expenditures through 2008 to meet increased electricity usage and customer growth, as well as capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities. Excludes capacity payments under purchased power and fuel contracts which are recoverable through various cost recovery clauses. (b) Represents firm commitments primarily in connection with natural gas transportation and storage, firm transmission service, nuclear fuel and a portion of its capital expenditures. (c) See Note 17 Commitments. FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of FPL Energy and its subsidiaries. FPL Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group Capital, including most of those under FPL Group Capitals debt, including all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its guarantees. See guarantees in table above. FPL Energy has guaranteed certain performance obligations of a power plant owned by a wholly owned subsidiary as part of a power purchase agreement (PPA) that expires in 2027. Under the PPA, the subsidiary could incur market based liquidated damages for failure to meet contractual minimum outputs. In addition, certain subsidiaries of FPL Energy have contracts that require certain projects to meet annual minimum generation amounts. Failure to meet the annual minimum generation amounts would result in the FPL Energy subsidiary incurring specified liquidated damages. Based on past performance of these and similar projects and current forward prices, management believes that the exposure associated with these guarantees is not material. FPL self insures for damage to certain transmission and distribution properties and maintains a funded storm and property insurance reserve to reduce the financial impact of storm losses. The balance of the storm fund reserve at December 31, 2003 was approximately $327 million, representing the amount in the storm fund (approximately $200 million) plus related deferred income taxes (approximately $127 million). The FPSC has indicated that it would consider future storm losses in excess of the funded reserve for possible recovery from customers. FPLs bank lines of credit discussed above are also available if needed to provide cash for storm restoration costs. New Accounting Rules and Interpretations Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations Effective January 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." See Note 16. Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which was subsequently revised. See Note 10. Derivative Instruments Effective July 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted FAS 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." There was no financial statement impact upon adoption of FAS 149. However, the statement could have a significant future impact on the number of contracts that will be marked to market through earnings. Effective October 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. (EITF) 03 11, which provides guidance on whether to report realized gains or losses on physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes on a gross or net basis and requires realized gains or losses on derivative contracts that net settle to be reported on a net basis. In addition, effective October 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted the SEC staff guidance requiring the realized and unrealized effects of derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges to b e reported within the same caption on the statements of income. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Note 3. Guarantees Effective January 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted FIN 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." See Note 17 Commitments. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity In May 2003, the FASB issued FAS 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," which was effective July 1, 2003. The primary change in accounting for FPL Group resulting from FAS 150 is the accounting treatment of mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests in subsidiaries with finite lives. In October 2003, the FASB deferred indefinitely the adoption of the FAS 150 provisions relating to mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests in subsidiaries with finite lives. The remaining provisions of FAS 150 did not have a financial statement impact for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, the FASB continues to address other FAS 150 implementation issues, none of which affect FPL Group or FPL currently but may affect them in the future. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the FASB issued FAS 132 (revised 2003), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," which expanded disclosures related to FPL Groups pension and postretirement plans. In January 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106 1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." See Note 2. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions where amounts are not subject to precise measurement or are dependent on future events. Critical accounting policies and estimates, which are important to the portrayal of both FPL Groups and FPLs financial condition and results of operations and which require complex, subjective judgments are as follows: Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities On January 1, 2001, FPL Group and FPL adopted FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended. FPL Group and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily forward purchases and sales, swaps, options and futures) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in fuel and electricity contracts, as well as to optimize the value of power generation assets and related contracts. To a lesser extent, FPL Group also engages in limited energy trading activities to take advantage of expected favorable price movements. These accounting pronouncements, which require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, apply not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. FAS 133 requires that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally developed models. The estimation of fair value for long term contracts requires the use of internally developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and fuel. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. In general, the models estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the prices in the contract and the forward prices. The market for electricity in the first one to three years of a contract is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed. Factors used in developing forward curves for electricity include the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contract. Substantially all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by FPL are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel and capacity clauses. In the non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, changes in the derivatives fair values are recognized in current earnings, unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met. For those transactions for which hedge accounting can be applied, much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, rather than being recognized in current earnings. Since FAS 133 became effective in 2001, the FASB has discussed and, from time to time, issued implementation guidance related to FAS 133. In particular, much of the interpretive guidance affects when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from the provisions of FAS 133. Despite the large volume of implementation guidance, FAS 133 and the supplemental guidance does not provide specific guidance on all contract issues. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying FAS 133 and its interpretations. The interpretation of FAS 133 continues to evolve. One possible result of changes in interpretation could be that certain contracts would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. During the fourth quarter of 2003, FPL Group and its subsidiaries adopted EITF 03 11, which precluded certain economic hedging transactions at FPL Energy from qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. Those transactions will now be marked to market and reported in the non qualifying hedge category and are likely to result in more volatility in the non qualifying hedge category in the future. The ongoing changes in accounting guidance relating to derivatives confirm managements belief in the importance of segregating the effects of the unrealized mark to market impact of non qualifying hedges. Without any change in FPL Groups economic positions or the timing or amounts of future cash flows, a small change in classification of particular transactions can result in significant changes in net income. This could be significant to FPL Energys results because the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to marke t (the physical assets themselves) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. Because of this, FPL Groups management continues to view results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3. Accounting for Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits FPL Group sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries. In addition, FPL Group sponsors a substantially contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits (other benefits) for retirees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements who elect participation at the time of retirement. The pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits. The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance. FPL Groups pension income net of the cost of other benefits was approximately $84 million, $82 million and $84 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The corresponding amounts allocated to FPL were $64 million, $73 million and $77 million, respectively. Pension income and the cost of other benefits are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all years, assumed increases in future compensation levels of 4.5% for 2003 and 5.5% for 2002 and 2001, and a weighted average discount rate of 6.00%, 6.25% and 6.75% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Based on current health care costs (as related to other benefits), the projected 2004 trend assumptions used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the plans are 9.5% for all age groups. The rat e is assumed to decrease over the next nine years to the ultimate trend rate of 5% for all age groups and remain at that level thereafter. In developing these assumptions, FPL Group evaluated input from its actuaries, as well as information available in the market place. For the expected long term rate of return on fund assets, FPL Group considered 10 year and 20 year historical median returns for a portfolio with a 50/50 equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds. FPL Group also considered its funds historical compounded returns. FPL Group believes that 7.75% is a reasonable long term rate of return on its plans assets. FPL Group will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as necessary. FPL Group bases its determination of pension and other benefits expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits expense and income only when they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or th e market related value of assets. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would have reduced FPL Groups net income for 2003 by approximately $14 million ($12 million for FPL). Lowering the discount rate assumption by 0.5% would have decreased FPL Groups net income for 2003 by approximately $6 million ($5 million for FPL). Raising the salary increase assumption by 0.5% would have decreased FPL Groups net income for 2003 by approximately $2 million ($2 million for FPL). Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. An increase or decrease of 1% in assumed health care cost trend rates would have a corresponding effect on the service and interest cost components and the accumulated obligation of other benefits of approximately $1 million and $9 million, respectively. The fair value of plan assets has increased from $2.4 billion at September 30, 2002 to $2.7 billion at September 30, 2003 for the pension plan and from $45 million at September 30, 2002 to $54 million at September 30, 2003 for other benefits. Management believes that, based on the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, FPL Group will not be required to make any cash contributions to the pension plan in the near future. FPL Group anticipates making cash contributions of approximately $27 million to the postretirement plan during 2004 and is studying the feasibility of transferring pension plan assets to fund claims associated with retiree medical benefits, as allowed by current tax law. See Note 2. Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets FPL Group evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable as described in FAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Under that standard, an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the assets fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized. Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil Dismantlement For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the FPSC at least every five years. The most recent studies, which became effective May 2002, indicate that FPLs portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage, is $6.4 billion, or $2.1 billion in 2003 dollars. Beginning January 1, 2003, FPL began recognizing nuclear decommissioning liabilities in accordance with FAS 143, which requires that a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation (ARO) be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the offsetting associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. At December 31, 2003, $2,009 million was accrued for nuclear decommissioning, of which $1,907 million was recorded as an ARO, $22 2 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $181 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $143 million was included in accrued asset removal costs. See Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plant and Dismantlement of Fossil Plant and Note 16. FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC at least every four years. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, fossil dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies, which became effective January 1, 2003, indicated that FPLs portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil units is $668 million. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered an ARO under FAS 143. At December 31, 2003, the provision for fossil dismantlement was approximately $274 million and is included in accrued asset removal costs. FPL Energy records a liability for the present value of Seabrooks expected decommissioning costs in accordance with FAS 143. Comprehensive studies are filed with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee every four years, with updates provided annually. These studies indicate that FPL Energys 88.23% portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning Seabrook, including costs associated with spent fuel storage, is $1.5 billion, or $553 million in 2003 dollars. At December 31, 2003, the ARO for Seabrooks nuclear decommissioning totaled approximately $163 million. See Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plant and Dismantlement of Fossil Plant and Note 16. The calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs, involves the use of estimates and judgments concerning the amount and timing of future expenditures and whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation under FAS 143. FPL Group and FPL also make interest rate, rate of return and inflation projections to determine funding requirements related to decommissioning. Periodically, FPL Group and FPL will be required to update their estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Regulatory Accounting FPL follows the accounting practices set forth in FAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." FAS 71 indicates that regulators can create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. If FPL were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new fa cilities. The continued applicability of FAS 71 is assessed at each reporting period. See Note 1 Regulation. See Note 1 for a discussion of FPL Groups and FPLs other significant accounting policies. Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity Energy Marketing and Trading Certain of FPL Groups subsidiaries, including FPL and FPL Energy, use derivative instruments (primarily forward purchases and sales, swaps, options and futures) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in fuel and electricity contracts, as well as to optimize the value of power generation assets. To a lesser extent, FPL Energy engages in limited energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Derivative instruments are recorded on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability (in derivative assets, other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities) measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause and the capacity clause. For FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized net in operating revenues for trading and managed hedge activities and in the same line item as the stated realized amounts for non qualifying hedges in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income unless hedge accounting is applied. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the statements of income to which they relate. See Note 3. The changes in the fair value of FPL Groups consolidated subsidiaries energy contract derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were as follows: Hedges on Owned Assets Proprietary Trading Managed Non Qualifying OCI FPL Cost Recovery Clauses FPL Group Total (millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 $ 4 $ $ 8 $ 28 $ 12 $ 52 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (9) (1 ) 12 (57 ) (3 ) (58 ) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI 18 18 Changes in valuation assumptions 2 2 (a) Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 12 2 (1 ) 85 98 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003 7 1 21 (11 ) 94 112 Net option premium payment (receipts) (12 ) 35 23 Total mark to market energy contract net assets at December 31, 2003 $ 7 $ 1 $ 9 $ (11 ) $ 129 $ 135 (a) Change in valuation assumption from applying volatility skewness (selection of an input assumption among alternatives based on the projected moneyness of the option) in option valuation. FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets at December 31, 2003 shown above are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows: December 31, 2003 (millions) Derivative assets $ 187 Other assets 17 Other current liabilities (44 ) Other liabilities (25 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets at December 31, 2003 $ 135 The sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at December 31, 2003 were as follows: Maturity 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (millions) Proprietary Trading: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices $ 1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1 Prices provided by other external sources 2 2 Modeled 1 1 2 4 Total 3 1 1 2 7 Owned Assets Managed: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 1 1 Prices provided by other external sources Modeled Total 1 1 Owned Assets Non Qualifying: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 1 1 Prices provided by other external sources 30 30 Modeled (9 ) (1 ) (10 ) Total 21 21 Owned Assets OCI: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 9 (3 ) 6 Prices provided by other external sources (8 ) (2 ) (1 ) (11 ) Modeled (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) (2 ) (1 ) (6 ) Total (6 ) (2 ) (2 ) (1 ) (11 ) Owned Assets FPL Cost Recovery Clauses: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 53 53 Prices provided by other external sources 21 1 22 Modeled 18 1 19 Total 92 1 1 94 Total sources of fair value $ 117 $ (4 ) $ $ (2 ) $ (1 ) $ 2 $ 112 Market Risk Sensitivity Substantially all financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of FPL Group and FPL described below are held for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks. FPL Groups Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, is responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. FPL Group and FPL manage their interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates an d adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. FPL Group and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. FPL Group manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees. Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. FPL Groups credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. Commodity price risk FPL Group uses a value at risk (VaR) model to measure market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the VaR figures are as follows: Trading and Managed Hedges Non Qualifying Hedges and Hedges in OCI (a) Total FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group (millions) December 31, 2002 $ $ $ $ 1 $ 3 $ 4 $ 1 $ 3 $ 4 December 31, 2003 $ $ $ $ 25 (b) $ 5 $ 26 $ 25 (b) $ 4 $ 26 Average for the period ended December 31, 2003 $ $ $ $ 11 $ 4 $ 13 $ 11 $ 3 $ 13 (a) Non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements. (b) In 2003, FPL expanded its fuel hedge program. Interest rate risk FPL Group and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and interest rate swaps. FPL Group and FPL manage their interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates and adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. The following are estimates of the fair value of FPL Groups and FPLs financial instruments: December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (millions) FPL Group: Long term debt, including current maturities $ 9,090 $ 9,548 (a) $ 5,895 $ 6,222 (a) Fixed income securities: Special Use Funds $ 1,316 $ 1,316 (a) $ 1,184 $ 1,184 (a) Other investments $ 57 $ 57 (a) $ 41 $ 41 (a) Interest rate swaps net unrealized loss $ (10 ) $ (10 ) (b) $ $ FPL: Long term debt, including current maturities $ 3,074 $ 3,193 (a) $ 2,434 $ 2,578 (a) Fixed income securities Special Use Funds $ 1,188 $ 1,188 (a) $ 1,066 $ 1,066 (a) (a) Based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues. (b) Based on market prices provided by external sources or modeled internally. The special use funds of FPL Group include restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of FPL Groups and FPLs nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value. Adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL. The market value adjustments of FPL Groups non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer term securities, as decommissioning activities are not expected to begin until at least 2012. See Note 11. FPL Group and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to adjust and mitigate interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements. At December 31, 2003, FPL Group had the following interest rate swaps: Notional Amount Effective Date Maturity Date Rate Paid Rate Received Estimated Fair Value (millions) (millions) Fair value hedges FPL Group Capital: $ 150 July 2003 September 2006 variable (a) 7.625 % $ (2 ) $ 150 July 2003 September 2006 variable (b) 7.625 % (2 ) $ 175 December 2003 June 2004 variable (c) 6.875 % 1 Total fair value hedges (3 ) Cash flow hedges FPL Energy: $ 103 July 2002 December 2007 4.41 % variable (d) (4 ) $ 200 August 2003 November 2007 3.557 % variable (d) (2 ) $ 94 December 2003 December 2017 4.245 % variable (e) (1 ) Total cash flow hedges (7 ) Total interest rate hedges $ (10 ) (a) Six month LIBOR plus 4.9900% (b) Six month LIBOR plus 4.9925% (c) Six month LIBOR plus 4.8921% (d) Three month LIBOR (e) One month LIBOR Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near term market change, the net fair value of FPL Groups net liabilities would increase by approximately $212 million ($89 million for FPL) at December 31, 2003. Equity price risk Included in the special use funds of FPL Group are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $926 million and $689 million ($781 million and $578 million for FPL) at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near term market change, would result in a $93 million ($78 million for FPL) reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL, or adjustments to OCI for FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, at December 31, 2003. Credit risk For all derivative and contractual transactions, FPL Group and its subsidiaries energy marketing and trading operations are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Relevant considerations when assessing FPL Group and its subsidiaries energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include: Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry. Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the United States. Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of cash collateral. The use of master netting agreements to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. FPL Groups policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties. Based on FPL Groups policies and risk exposures related to credit, FPL Group and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial positions as a result of counterparty nonperformance. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 99% of FPL Groups and 98% of FPLs energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have at least investment grade credit ratings.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. In the discussion of Results of Operations below, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. Results of Operations Overview FPL Groups net income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $890 million, $473 million and $781 million, respectively. See Note 18 for segment information. FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the retail sale of electricity and, in 2003, accounted for more than 80% of FPL Groups net income. FPL Energy derives the majority of its operating revenues through wholesale electricity sales and provided continued growth to FPL Group primarily due to the expansion of its diverse portfolio, industry leading position in wind generation and moderate risk approach. FPL Groups net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 benefited from improved results at both FPL and FPL Energy. FPLs results primarily improved as a result of strong revenue growth from retail base operations. FPL Energys results improved due to over 3,900 mw of new generation capacity being added in 2003 and the absence of certain wr ite offs recorded in 2002. FPL Groups effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 reflects production tax credits for wind projects at FPL Energy. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 was further reduced by the gain from an income tax settlement referenced below. Net income reflects the following items which increased (decreased) reported results: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) FPL: Merger related costs $ $ $ (16 ) FPL Energy: Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ (3 ) $ (222 ) $ Restructuring and other charges $ $ (73 ) $ Unrealized gains from non qualifying hedges $ 22 $ 1 $ 8 Corporate and Other: Impairment, restructuring and other charges $ $ (94 ) $ Gain from income tax settlement $ $ 30 $ Merger related costs $ $ $ (3 ) FPL Groups management uses earnings excluding these items (adjusted earnings) internally for financial planning, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and for FPL Groups employee incentive compensation plan. FPL Group also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. FPL Groups management believes adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded items are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, both the size and nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Beginning in 2002, FPL Group segregated unrealized mark to market gains and losses on derivative transactions into two categories. Prior year amounts were reclassified into these categories. The first category, referred to as trading and managed hedge activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts. The unrealized mark to market gains (losses) from trading and managed hedge activities were $(1) million, $8 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are reported net in operating revenues. The second category, referred to as non qualifying hedges, represents the net unrealized effect of derivative transactions entered into as economic hedges (but which do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended, and do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception) and the ineffective portion of transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges. The unrealized gains from non qualifying hedges were $37 million, $1 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are reported in the same line item as the related realized amounts in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. These transactions have been entered into to reduce FPL Groups aggregate risk. Any position that is moved between non qualifying hedge activity and trading and managed hedge activity is transferred at its fair value on the date of reclassification. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Note 3. In May 2003, FPL Group announced it would begin using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation beginning in 2004. Based on the stock options outstanding at December 31, 2003, the implementation of the fair value based method is expected to reduce FPL Groups net income by approximately $4 million in 2004. See Note 1 Stock Based Compensation. FPL FPLs net income available to FPL Group for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $733 million, $717 million and $679 million, respectively. During 2003, FPLs net income benefited from higher revenues from retail base operations. However, higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes partially offset these higher revenues. FPLs 2003 net income also reflects a loss related to the redemption of preferred stock, which was substantially offset by tax benefits related to the favorable settlement of tax audit issues with the IRS. During 2002, higher revenues from retail base operations and lower depreciation and interest charges were partially offset by higher O&M expenses. Also in 2001, FPL recorded merger related expenses totaling $26 million ($16 million after tax). For additional information regarding merger related expenses, see Note 7. In March 2002, the FPSC approved a new rate agreement regarding FPLs retail base rates, which became effective April 15, 2002 and expires December 31, 2005. The 2002 2005 rate agreement replaced a rate agreement that was effective April 15, 1999 through April 14, 2002. Both agreements include a revenue sharing mechanism for each of the twelve month periods covered by the agreements, whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of a stated threshold are required to be shared on the basis of two thirds refunded to retail customers and one third retained by FPL. Revenues from retail base operations in excess of a second threshold are required to be refunded 100% to retail customers. The 1999 2002 rate agreement allowed FPL at its discretion to recover, as special depreciation, up to $100 million in each year of the three year agreement period. The additional depreciation recovery was required to be applied to nuclear and or fossil generating assets based on future depreciation studies. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. During the term of the agreement, FPLs ROE was from time to time outside the 10% 12% authorized range. However, the revenue sharing mechanism described above was specified as the appropriate and exclusive mechanism to address that circumstance. The agreement included provisions which limited depreciation rates and accruals for nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs to the then approved levels and limited amounts recoverable under the environmental clause during the term of that agreement. The 2002 2005 rate agreement provides for a $250 million annual reduction in retail base revenues allocated to all customers by reducing customers base rates and service charges by approximately 7%. The revenue sharing thresholds specified in the 2002 2005 rate agreement are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2002(a) 2003 2004 2005 (millions) 66 2/3% to customers $ 3,580 $ 3,680 $ 3,780 $ 3,880 100% to customers $ 3,740 $ 3,840 $ 3,940 $ 4,040 (a) Refund was limited to 71.5% (representing the period April 15 through December 31, 2002) of the revenues from base rate operations exceeding the thresholds. During the term of the 2002 2005 rate agreement, FPL will not have an authorized regulatory ROE range for the purpose of addressing earnings levels. However, FPL will continue to file monthly earnings surveillance reports with the FPSC and if the reported ROE falls below 10% during the term of the 2002 2005 rate agreement, FPL may petition the FPSC to amend its base rates. The 2002 2005 rate agreement would terminate on the effective date of any final order issued in a proceeding that changes FPLs base rates. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates. In addition, depreciation rates will not be changed during the term of the agreement; however, FPL will reduce its recorded depreciation expense by $125 million annually. During 2002, FPL reclassified certain amounts that were previously classified within accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability. The reclassifications were made as a result of the terms of the 2002 2 005 rate agreement, as well as other FPSC actions with regard to accumulated nuclear amortization. The amounts reclassified included $170 million of special depreciation and $99 million of nuclear amortization. During 2003 and 2002, FPL credited depreciation expense for $125 million as permitted under the rate agreement. The $125 million annual credit to depreciation went first to offset the $170 million of special depreciation and the remainder to accumulated depreciation. The $99 million of nuclear amortization is being credited to depreciation expense ratably over the remaining life of the plants, based on the term of the existing operating licenses of the plants, at a rate of $7 million per year. The regulatory liability balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002 are included in other liabilities on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 Regulation and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. In April 2002, the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association and certain hospitals filed a joint notice of administrative appeal with the FPSC and the Supreme Court of Florida appealing the FPSCs approval of the 2002 2005 rate agreement. The appellants contend that the FPSC rushed to judgment and approved the settlement without the benefit of any evidentiary record to support its actions, and requested that the Supreme Court remand the case to the FPSC for additional proceedings. In November 2003, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the appeal. There is no specified time by which the Supreme Court of Florida must rule. FPL intends to continue to vigorously contest this appeal and believes that the FPSCs decision approving the 2002 2005 rate agreement will be upheld. FPLs operating revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) Retail base operations $ 3,680 $ 3,603 $ 3,616 Revenue refund provision (3 ) (34 ) (110 ) Cost recovery clauses and other pass through costs 4,558 3,793 3,955 Other 58 16 16 Total $ 8,293 $ 7,378 $ 7,477 For the year ended December 31, 2003, the increase in retail base revenues was primarily due to an increase in customer accounts and an increase in usage per retail customer. The increase in 2003 was partially offset by the effect of the 7% base reduction in retail rates, or $62 million, pursuant to the 2002 2005 rate agreement that was effective in mid April 2002. A 2.4% increase in the number of retail customer accounts increased revenues by $85 million, while the balance of the increase, or $54 million, was primarily due to a 1.7% increase in usage per retail customer. Based upon econometric models, management estimates about half of the growth in usage for the year was associated with higher per capita income and the remainder is due to weather related usage and price elasticity associated with lower rates. The increase in retail base revenues in 2002 (net of the revenue refund provision discussed above) was due to a 2.1% increase in retail customer accounts which contributed $78 million to revenues while the balance of the increase, or $112 million, was primarily due to a 3.5% increase in electricity usage per retail customer. The 7% rate reduction caused a $203 million reduction in retail base revenues. Revenues from cost recovery clauses and other pass through costs, such as franchise fees and revenue taxes, do not significantly affect net income; however, under or over recovery of such costs can significantly affect FPL Groups and FPLs operating cash flows. Fluctuations in these revenues, as well as in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are primarily driven by changes in energy sales, fuel prices and capacity charges. Ordinarily, the fuel charge is set annually based on estimated fuel costs and estimated customer usage, plus or minus a true up for prior period estimates. During 2003, the FPSC approved fuel adjustment increases of $347 million effective April 1, 2003 and $214 million effective July 31, 2003 both of which were recovered in 2003. These increases were due to higher than projected oil and natural gas prices. During 2002, the FPSC approved a risk management fuel procurement program which became effective January 1, 2003. The program is intended to reduce the risk of unexpected fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. The results of the program are reviewed by the FPSC as part of the annual review of fuel costs. The increase in revenues from cost recovery clauses and other pass through costs for the year ended December 31, 2003, was primarily due to higher fuel costs. Higher than projected fuel costs resulted in an underrecovery, which increased deferred clause expenses on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets and negatively affected FPL Groups and FPLs cash flows from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. During 2002, clause revenues (primarily fuel related) declined due to lower fuel costs. FPLs annual fuel filing for 2001, as approved by the FPSC, included approximately $518 million of under recovered fuel costs from 2000, of which one half ($259 million) was recovered in 2001 and the balanc e was recovered in 2002. FPL agreed to this two year recovery, rather than the typical one year time frame, to ease the impact on customers bills. FPL also agreed that, instead of receiving a return at the commercial paper rate through the fuel clause, the under recovery would be included as a rate base regulatory asset over the two year recovery period. See Note 1 Regulation. FPLs O&M expenses increased $25 million in 2003 primarily due to a $29 million increase in nuclear maintenance expenses associated with more comprehensive inspections of the reactor vessel heads at FPLs nuclear facilities as ordered by the NRC, as well as increased outage and plant maintenance costs. In 2003, the NRC issued an order, subsequent to a previously issued NRC bulletin, requiring all pressurized water reactor licensees, including FPL, to perform visual and volumetric inspections of reactor vessel heads at each units scheduled refueling outage to identify if degradation such as cracking or corrosion has occurred. During the scheduled refueling outages for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 in October 2002, Turkey Point Unit No. 3 in March 2003 and Turkey Point Unit No. 4 in October 2003, FPL performed visual and volumetric inspections and found no degradation associated with the reactor vessel heads. In late April and early May 2003, while volumetric inspections of the rea ctor vessel head at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 were being performed during a scheduled refueling outage, two CRDM nozzles were found with one small crack in each. Both cracks were less than 50% through the thickness of the CRDM nozzle. No leakage was observed and both cracks were repaired during the outage. Also during the St. Lucie Unit No. 2 scheduled refueling outage, the steam generators were inspected and more tubes had to be plugged than anticipated. The inspection results were evaluated and revised tube plugging projections developed. Management intends to replace the steam generators at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2007 and will delay the reactor vessel head replacement for St. Lucie Unit No. 2 until 2007 to coincide with the steam generator replacement. FPL anticipates replacing the reactor vessel heads at Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 during their next scheduled refueling outage and at St. Lucie Unit No. 1 during a scheduled refueling ou tage in the fall of 2005. Reactor vessel head replacements for these three units are expected to add approximately 35 days to the number of days a unit is removed from service during a typical scheduled refueling outage. The cost for the reactor vessel heads and steam generators is estimated to be $525 million and is included in FPLs estimated capital expenditures. See Note 17 Commitments. The cost of performing inspections and any necessary repairs until the reactor vessel heads are replaced is being recognized as expense on a levelized basis over a five year period beginning in 2002, as authorized by the FPSC, and amounted to $13 million in each of 2003 and 2002. In 2003, the NRC issued a bulletin recommending that utilities with bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations perform visual inspections. Visual inspections of the bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations were performed in 2003 during Turkey Point Unit No. 4s scheduled refueling outage, and no evidence of leakage from these penetrations was noted. A visual inspection of Turkey Point Unit No. 3s bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations will be performed at its next scheduled refueling outage in the fall of 2004. St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 do not have bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations. In addition to the increase in nuclear O&M expenses in 2003, employee benefit costs, primarily medical related, increased $17 million and property and liability insurance costs increased $17 million due to higher insurance premiums combined with lower refunds under nuclear insurance policies. These cost pressures are expected to continue in 2004. The 2003 cost increases were partially offset by the absence of the storm fund accrual of $35 million (discussed below) recorded in 2002, as well as productivity improvements in other areas. FPLs O&M expenses increased $143 million in 2002. Approximately $42 million was attributable to higher nuclear costs associated with more comprehensive inspections of the reactor vessel heads at FPLs nuclear facilities. In addition to the increase in nuclear O&M expenses in 2002, employee benefit costs increased $15 million and property insurance costs increased $9 million. Also in December 2002, the FPSC approved a one t ime $35 million addition to the storm fund reserve. The balance of the increase in 2002 O&M expenses primarily related to costs associated with work force reductions, overhaul of fossil plants and system reliability efforts. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $831 million in 2002 to $898 million in 2003 primarily due to FPLs investment in generation and distribution expansion to support customer growth and demand which included the completion of the Fort Myers and Sanford repowering projects. The decrease in depreciation expense during 2002 reflects the $125 million credit to depreciation expense authorized under the 2002 2005 rate agreement. This credit was partially offset by higher depreciation expense associated with the amortization of a regulatory asset recorded as a result of a litigation settlement. The amortization approximates $44 million annually and is being recovered over a 5 year period, beginning in January 2002, through the fuel and capacity clauses. The Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 received operating license extensions in 2002, which give FPL the option to operate these units until 2032 and 2033, respectively. The NRC extended the operating licenses for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 during 2003, which give FPL the option to operate these units until 2036 and 2043, respectively. The original license expiration dates for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 and for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 are 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2023, respectively. FPL has not yet decided to exercise the option to operate past the original license expiration dates, although FPL is continuing to take actions to ensure the long term viability of the units in order to preserve this option. The decision will be made for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 by 2007 and for St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 by 2011. Any adjustment to depreciation and decommissioning rates would require FPSC approval. Interest charges for 2003 increased primarily due to higher average debt balances used to fund increased investment in generation, transmission and distribution expansion and under recovery of fuel costs. This increase was partially offset by a decline in average interest rates of approximately 80 basis points in 2003 as compared to 2002. In 2002, the decrease in interest charges was primarily due to lower average interest rates, as well as lower average debt balances as a result of the recovery of previously under recovered fuel costs. FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers. In 2003, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 4% of FPLs total operating revenues. Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier. This regulatory restructuring is expected to result in a shift from cost based rates to market based rates for energy production and other services provided to retail customers. Although the legislation and initiatives vary substantially, common areas of focus include when market based pricing will be available for wholesale and retail customers, what existing prudently incurred costs in excess of the market based price will be recoverable and wheth er generating assets should be separated from transmission, distribution and other assets. It is generally believed transmission and distribution activities would remain regulated. Recently, these state restructuring efforts have diminished, and several states have delayed the implementation or reversed previously approved restructuring legislation and rules. Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the electric industry in Florida in the near future. The FPSC promotes competition for building major new steam generating capacity by requiring investor owned electric utilities, such as FPL, to issue an RFP. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the needed generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and or operating generation capacity of the type proposed, the investor owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a power purchase agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC authorize the construction of the bidders generation capacity under the terms of the power purchase agreement. In 2003, FPL issued an RFP for additional power resources of approximately 1,100 mw beginning in June 2007. In January 2004, after evaluating alternative proposals, FPL concluded that its plan to build a new natural gas fired plant at its Turkey Point site was the best and most cost effective option to provide the 1,100 mw. In March 2004, FPL plans to file a petition for approval of this alternative with the FPSC. A decision is expected by mid 2004. This alternative will also be subject to approval by a Siting Board (comprised of the governor and cabinet) under the Florida Electrical Power Plant Siting Act. The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes which could affect competition in wholesale transactions. In 1999, the FERC issued its final order on RTOs which, under a variety of structures, provides for the independent operation of transmission systems for a given geographic area. In March 2001, the FERC approved GridFlorida (FPLs, Progress Energy Florida, Inc.s and Tampa Electric Companys proposed RTO) as the RTO for peninsular Florida. In December 2001, the FPSC determined that the RTO as proposed was not in the best interest of Florida customers and required the companies to develop a modified proposal. In March 2002, FPL, Progress Energy Florida, Inc. and Tampa Electric Company filed a modified RTO proposal with the FPSC changing the structure of GridFlorida from a for profit transmission company to a non profit ISO. Under the proposal, FPL would continue to own its transmission lines and the ISO would manage t hem. In September 2002, the FPSC approved many of the aspects of the modified RTO proposal, allowing recovery of GridFloridas incremental costs through the capacity clause. In October 2002, the Public Counsel filed a notice of administrative appeal with the Supreme Court of Florida seeking an appeal of the FPSCs order. In June 2003, the Florida Supreme Court dismissed the Public Counsels appeal of the FPSCs approval of GridFlorida without prejudice concluding that the appeal was premature because the FPSC proceedings had not yet been completed and not all aspects of the FPSCs order on appeal were considered final agency action. The FPSC has restored the GridFlorida docket to active status and in December 2003 issued a procedural order establishing a series of workshops through 2004 to address GridFlorida issues. In July 2002, the FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to reform public utilities transmission tariffs and implement a standardized design for electric markets in the United States. The proposed rule would, among other things, require FERC regulated entities, including FPL, that own, control or operate transmission facilities to hire an independent transmission provider, which can be an RTO such as GridFlorida for the operation of those facilities. The proposed rule also will require the independent transmission provider to administer various spot markets for the sale of electricity and ancillary services and to manage congestion on the transmission system using financial congestion rights. Legislators and regulators from the southeast and western states have expressed strong reservations about the FERCs proposal. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper responding to comments on its proposed rule.&nb sp; The White Paper indicates that the FERC intends to be more flexible on how and when the final rule will be implemented, defer to regional state committees to address significant RTO/ISO features, require regulated utilities to join RTOs or ISOs and require RTOs to implement spot markets. While a moratorium on further action by the FERC was included in the proposed Energy Policy Act, the status of that legislation is uncertain. FPL is evaluating the proposed FERC rule and is currently unable to determine its effects, if any, on FPLs operations. In the event the basis of regulation for some or all of FPLs business changes from cost based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment. See Note 1 Regulation. In addition, FPL is constructing approximately 1,900 mw of natural gas combined cycle generation at its Martin and Manatee sites with a planned in service date of June 2005. In January 2003, CPV Gulfcoast, Ltd. filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Florida challenging the FPSCs 2002 approval of the Martin and Manatee expansion and in April 2003, filed its initial brief. In May 2003, FPL filed its answer brief, which included a request for dismissal. The Supreme Court of Florida will not hold oral arguments. There is no specified time by which the Supreme Court of Florida must rule. FPL Energy FPL Energys net income (loss) for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $194 million, $(169) million and $113 million, respectively. FPL Energys net income has become a greater portion of FPL Groups consolidated net income increasing from 1% in 1997 to 22% in 2003. Net income reflects the following items which increased (decreased) reported results: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ (3 ) $ (222 ) $ Restructuring and other charges $ $ (73 ) $ Unrealized gains from non qualifying hedges $ 22 $ 1 $ 8 Net income for 2003 included a charge of $3 million after tax due to a change in accounting principle (see Note 10) and a net unrealized gain of $22 million after tax associated with the mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges. The net loss for 2002 was the result of FPL Energy recording impairment and other charges totaling $485 million ($295 million after tax). The impairment and other charges consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of $365 million ($222 million after tax) representing the cumulative effect of adopting FAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and restructuring and other charges totaling $120 million ($73 million after tax) due to the unfavorable market conditions in the wholesale energy market. For further discussion of FAS 142, see Note 5, and for the restructuring and other charges, see below. In addition, during 2002, FPL Energy recorded less than $1 million of after tax net unrealized mark to market gain s from non qualifying hedges compared to gains of $8 million during 2001. For further discussion of derivative instruments, see Note 3. In 2002, as a result of depressed economic conditions coupled with an oversupply of energy generating facilities in certain markets, projected profit margins for certain natural gas projects had declined and were not sufficient to cover the cost of capital. Therefore, FPL Energy made a strategic decision during 2002 to substantially exit the fossil fueled greenfield merchant power plant development business for the foreseeable future and, as a result, recorded restructuring and impairment charges in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income totaling $103 million ($63 million after tax). See Note 6 FPL Energy. Also in 2002, FPL Energy recorded a charge of approximately $17 million ($10 million after tax) against its investment in two wind projects due to regulatory issues associated with another investor in the projects. The resulting expense is included in equity in earnings of equity method investees in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. After resolving the regulatory issues, in December 2003, FPL Energy purchased the remaining interests in these wind projects and began consolidating their operations. FPL Energys 2003 net income benefited from the full year effect of 2,235 mw of generation added in 2002, the majority of which was added in the fourth quarter of 2002, as well as 3,904 mw added in 2003. The 2002 additions include the purchase of an 88.23% interest in Seabrook as well as wind and natural gas fired assets. During 2003, FPL Energy added 975 mw of wind generation and 2,929 mw of natural gas fired assets. In aggregate, 2002 and 2003 project additions contributed $82 million to 2003 net income. FPL Energys operating revenues and operating expenses for the year ended 2003 increased $561 million and $352 million, respectively, primarily driven by project additions. In addition, restructuring and impairment charges discussed above added $103 million to operating expenses in 2002. Operating revenues net of operating expenses, primarily fuel, were essentially flat in the balance of the portfolio. & nbsp;Both the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions experienced higher energy prices offset by lower generation and higher fuel costs. Construction is underway on another gas fired power plant that will add 744 mw of generation in PJM in the last half of 2004. FPL Energy expects its future portfolio growth to come from a mix of asset acquisitions and wind development, assuming pending legislation reestablishing the production tax credits for new wind facilities is enacted. Earnings from investments in partnerships and joint ventures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, presented as equity in earnings of equity method investees, increased $13 million from the prior year reflecting an increase in unrealized gains associated with the mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges and a $17 million charge against its investment in two wind projects recorded in 2002 (discussed above). In addition, equity in earnings of equity method investees reflects lower gains from contract restructurings and lower earnings from a project in California, as well as lower project earnings due to higher fuel prices in the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions. FPL Energys net income for the year ended 2003 also reflected higher interest expense of approximately $38 million associated with increasing average debt balances due to growth in the business partially offset by a decline in average interest rates of approximately 30 basis points compared with same period in 2002. FPL Energys net income in 2002 also included the positive effects of a $10 million insurance settlement. In 2003, the NRC issued an order, subsequent to a previously issued NRC bulletin, requiring all pressurized water reactor licensees, including Seabrook, to perform visual and volumetric inspections of reactor vessel heads to identify if degradation such as cracking or corrosion has occurred. Seabrook will be required to perform 100% visual and volumetric inspections in 2006, and subsequently, visual inspections every third outage and volumetric inspections every fourth outage. In 2003, the NRC issued a bulletin recommending that utilities with bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations perform visual inspections. In October 2003, visual inspections of the bottom mounted instrumentation penetrations were performed during Seabrooks scheduled refueling outage, and no evidence of leakage from these penetrations was noted. The next refueling outage is scheduled to be performed in April 2005. FPL Energys 2002 net income benefited from project additions, primarily wind assets in the central and western regions of the United States, and the purchase of an 88.23% interest in Seabrook in November 2002, as well as a natural gas fired power plant that began operations during the fourth quarter of 2002. Project additions totaling more than 1,000 mw in 2001 and more than 2,200 mw in 2002 contributed $41 million to 2002 net income, $22 million coming from the full year effect of new wind projects that came on line in the second half of 2001 and 324 mw of new wind generation added in 2002, and the balance from earnings from other project additions, including Seabrook. For additional information concerning the Seabrook acquisition, see Note 9 FPL Energy. FPL Energys operating revenues and operating expenses for 2002 increased $80 million and $220 million, respectively, primarily driven by project additions coupled with the previously disc ussed restructuring charges that added $103 million to operating expenses in 2002. Increased revenues from project additions were partially offset by lower revenues from the balance of the consolidated portfolio primarily due to reduced energy prices driven by new entrants in the market, as well as mild weather in the Northeast, including drought conditions which had a negative impact on the performance of the hydro assets. Earnings from investments in partnerships and joint ventures, presented as equity in earnings of equity method investees, declined $5 million in 2002 reflecting the $17 million charge recorded against investments in two wind projects discussed above and a gain of $23 million on the restructuring of a gas supply contract that was renegotiated to yield lower fuel costs and is expected to improve future cash flows, as well as improve equity in earnings from the project. In addition, equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2001 included a gain of $34 million resulting from the sale of a partnership interest in a geothermal project. This gain was almost entirely offset by the write off of affiliate debt associated with the partnership interest, which was included in other net. The remaining increase in 2002 equity in earnings is primarily due to increased contract prices, as the majority of the output of the projects was sold under long term contracts. Interest charges increased $12 million during 2002 associated with higher debt balances due to growth in the business, partly offset by lower average interest rates. Interest income in 2002 declined approximately $14 million and includes, in 2001, interest from a favorable settlement with the IRS. In addition, the decline in interest income reflects lower interest rates in 2002. Over the last several years, there has been a general decline in the wholesale energy market, including deterioration in forward prices and reduced liquidity, as well as increasing credit concerns that have limited the number of counterparties with which FPL Energy does business. These market conditions have made it more difficult for FPL Energy to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices, to optimize the value of its assets and to contract the output of its plants. Any uncontracted output from the plants has been and will be sold into the market place at prevailing prices when economical. Given current market conditions, when FPL Energys existing power sales agreements expire, more of the energy produced may be sold through shorter term contracts and into competitive wholesale markets. Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary by geographic region. Expanded competition in a relaxed regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for FPL Energy. Some of the factors affecting success in these markets are the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth and exposure to legal and regulatory changes. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets divested under deregulation plans and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets. Wholesale energy markets have experienced lower demand and lower wholesale electricity prices as a result of weather and economic conditions and the oversupply of generation in certain regions. FPL Energy seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio, by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants. FPL Energys 2004 earnings are subject to variability due to, among other things, commodity price exposure, counterparty performance, weather conditions and project restructuring activities. FPL Energys exposure to commodity price risk is reduced by the high degree of contract coverage obtained for 2004. As of December 31, 2003, FPL Energys capacity under contract for 2004 is as follows: Asset Class Available MW (a) % MW Under Contract Wind 2,719 99 % Non wind assets under long term contract 1,255 98 % Merchants: Seabrook 1,024 97 % NEPOOL/PJM/NYPP 1,879 34 % (b) ERCOT 3,009 65 % (b) Other (WECC/SERC) 1,345 60 % (b) Total portfolio 11,231 74 % (a) Weighted to reflect in service dates and planned maintenance. (b) Represents on peak mw under contract. FPL Energys results are affected by natural fluctuations in weather. In addition to the effect of temperature, which is reflected in commodity prices and demand, changes in weather affect the wind portfolio as well as the hydro units in Maine. In managing its exposure to commodity prices, FPL Energy is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations. FPL Energy actively manages the trade off between market risk and credit risk, as well as exposure with individual counterparties as a function of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of FPL Energys 2004 contracted revenues are with investment grade counterparties. Corporate and Other Corporate and Others net loss for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $37 million, $75 million and $11 million, respectively. Net loss reflects the following items which increased (decreased) reported results: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (millions) Impairment, restructuring and other charges $ $ (94 ) $ Gain from income tax settlement $ $ 30 $ Merger related costs $ $ $ (3 ) Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of FPL FiberNet and other corporate income and expenses, such as interest income and interest expense. Results from Corporate and Other for 2003 primarily reflect higher interest charges and the absence of restructuring and impairment charges recorded in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, losses at Corporate and Other reflect impairment and other charges totaling $94 million after tax as a result of declines in the telecommunications market (see Note 6 Corporate and Other) and reserves against certain leveraged lease investments (see Note 17 Other Contingencies). These charges were partially offset by a $30 million gain in the first quarter of 2002 from the resolution of an income tax matter. The impairment and other charges were recorded as a result of declines in the telecommunications market. FPL FiberNet completed valuation studies to assess the recoverability of its assets and as a result, in 2002, recorded charges of approximately $104 million ($64 million after tax). Of this amount, $85 million ($52 million after tax) represents an impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment, the fair value of which was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, FPL FiberNet decided not to pursue the planned build out of metro fiber rings in certain cities, and restructuring charges of $19 million ($12 million after tax) were recognized related to the write off of development costs and inventory. These charges are included in restructuring and impairment charges in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. Although the demand for telecommunication capacity continues to grow, many telecommunication companies have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 11) as market conditions deteriorated. This has caused customer credit to become a primary focus for the industry as credit downgrades have increased. Most of FPL FiberNets customers are required to pay in advance and past due amounts are closely monitored and actively pursued. Several of FPL FiberNets customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 and reserves for any prepetition receivables due to FPL FiberNet have been established. As a result of this deterioration and general economic conditions, FPL FiberNet has experienced a slowdown in its longhaul (intercity transport) business. FPL FiberNets metropolitan network continues to benefit from an expanding customer base and increasing use of FPL FiberNets network by it s existing customers. FPL FiberNets capital expenditure forecast for 2004 2008 is approximately $50 million. Subsidiaries of FPL Group, other than FPL, have investments in several leveraged leases, two of which are with MCI Telecommunications Corporation (MCI). In July 2002, MCI filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. Due to the uncertainty of collectibility associated with these leveraged leases, FPL Group recorded reserves totaling approximately $48 million ($30 million after tax) in the third quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2003, investments in leveraged leases with MCI totaled approximately $15 million and related deferred tax liabilities totaled approximately $11 million. An agreement has been reached with MCI that will consolidate and amend the leases upon the effective date of MCIs reorganization plan. On September 2, 2003, MCI was authorized by the bankruptcy court to assume the consolidated and amended lease, cure any prepetition arrearages and take all further action necessary or appropriate to effectuate t he amended lease upon the effective date of MCIs reorganization plan. The amended lease would be classified as an operating lease and is not expected to have a significant effect on FPL Groups financial statements. In October 2003, the bankruptcy court approved MCIs reorganization plan which is expected to become effective in early 2004. In connection with the redemption in 1999 of its one third ownership interest in Olympus Communications, L.P. (Olympus), an indirect subsidiary of FPL Group holds a note receivable from a limited partnership, of which Olympus is a general partner. The note receivable is secured by a pledge of the redeemed ownership interest. Olympus is an indirect subsidiary of Adelphia Communications Corp. (Adelphia). In June 2002, Adelphia and a number of its subsidiaries, including Olympus, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The note receivable plus accrued interest totaled approximately $127 million at December 31, 2003 and are included in other investments on FPL Groups consolidated balance sheets. The note was due on July 1, 2002 and is currently in default. Based on the most recent publicly available financial information set forth in Olympus Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2001, total assets of Olympus exceeded liabilities by approximately $3.6 billion and Olympus served 1,787,000 basic subscribers. Olympus has not filed its Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 or any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q or Annual Reports on Form 10 K with the SEC, and consequently the September 30, 2001 financial information may not be indicative of Olympus current financial position. Olympus has stated publicly that it expects to restate its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, and its interim financial statements for 2001 and possibly other periods. In addition, current management of Olympus believes that other public information provided by the Rigas family, which controlled Adelphia, was unrel iable. In July 2002, the SEC filed suit against Adelphia and certain of its officers alleging that Adelphia fraudulently excluded billions of dollars of debt from its financial statements, misstated its financial and operating results and concealed rampant self dealing by the Rigas family. In October 2003, Olympus filed certain limited financial information as required by orders of the bankruptcy court. However, such information was not useful to FPL Group in its evaluation of the collectibility of the note receivable. In January 2004, the FPL Group subsidiary filed its proof of claims with the bankruptcy court. In August 2002, an affidavit was filed in the bankruptcy court proceedings by a director of Lazard Freres & Co. LLC stating that, based on his analysis, the market value of FPL Groups secured interest in Olympus exceeded the carrying value of the note receivable plus accrued interest. In February 2003, FPL Group obtained an evaluation of the Olympus assets from an independent third party. The results of the evaluation, which was based on the limited information available, indicated that there was no impairment. On February 25, 2004, Adelphia and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Olympus, filed a disclosure statement (Disclosure Statement) and plan of reorganization (Plan). The Disclosure Statement provides for the "deemed consolidation" of the Adelphia debtors into ten separate groups for purposes of voting, confirmation and distribution under the Plan. The note receivable has been classified under the Plan by the Adelphia debtors as one of those groups and, under the proposed treatment under the Plan, the note receivable will be satisfied with shares of common stock of a reorganized Adelphia. FPL Group believes that the Disclosure Statement and the Plan have misclassified the note receivable and anticipates filing appropriate objections. FPL Group cannot predict whether its objection to the Plan will result in changes to the Plan or whether the Plan will be approved. As such, the ultimate collectibility of the note receivable cannot be assured. Liquidity and Capital Resources FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, to pay maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, to redeem outstanding debt and preferred stock. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated funds and the issuance, from time to time, of debt and equity securities, consistent with FPL Groups and FPLs objective of maintaining, on a long term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. Credit ratings can affect FPL Groups and FPLs ability to obtain short and long term financing, the cost of such financing and the execution of their financing strategies. Absent new investment opportunities in 2004, management expects cash to be available to FPL Group in e xcess of needs that are presently identified. FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have $3.0 billion ($2.0 billion for FPL Group Capital and $1.0 billion for FPL) of bank lines of credit currently available. Half of these credit facilities expire in October 2004 with a one year term out option. The other half of the credit facilities expire in October 2006 and provide for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $500 million for FPL Group Capital and up to $250 million for FPL subject to the aggregate commitment ($1.0 billion for FPL Group Capital and $500 million for FPL) under the applicable facility. These credit facilities are available to support the companies commercial paper programs and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a Transmission and Distribution property loss (in the case of FPL), as well as for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2003, letters of credit totaling $85 million and $0 were outstanding under the FPL Group Capital and FPL credit facilities, respectively. In addition, FPL Group Capital and FPL each have a promissory note with a bank under which they may borrow up to $200 million and $500 million, respectively. Borrowings under both promissory notes may be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2003, FPL Group Capital had $200 million outstanding under its promissory note and is included in notes payable on FPL Groups consolidated balance sheets. FPL had no amounts outstanding under its promissory note. FPL Group (which guarantees payment of FPL Group Capitals credit facilities and promissory note) is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to capitalization and a minimum interest coverage ratio under the terms of FPL Group Capitals credit facilities. FPL is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to capitalization under FPLs credit facilities. At December 31, 2003, FPL Group and FPL were in compliance with their respective ratios. During 2003, FPL Group and its subsidiaries obtained debt financing totaling approximately $3.1 billion; approximately $894 million at FPL, $1.1 billion at FPL Group Capital and $1.1 billion at FPL Energy. During 2003, FPL Group also raised approximately $73 million of equity through its dividend reinvestment plan and employee thrift plans. The proceeds from FPLs debt were used to repay a portion of short term borrowings, redeem higher interest rate debt and for other corporate purposes. In addition, FPL redeemed preferred stock with an aggregate par value of $221 million during 2003. FPL Group Capitals debt proceeds were used to repay a portion of commercial paper issued to fund investments in independent power projects. Subsidiaries of FPL Energy that issued debt used the proceeds to either fund, or return to FPL Energy a portion of the indirect investment it made for the development, acquisition and or construction o f independent power projects, as well as to fund operations and debt service. In addition, effective July 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL consolidated certain VIEs in accordance with FIN 46. FPL consolidated $135 million of 2.34% senior secured notes maturing in June 2006. The notes were issued by a VIE in June 2003 and the proceeds were used by the VIE to refinance its existing debt and for the procurement of nuclear fuel and related general corporate purposes. In 2003, this consolidated VIE also established a $65 million senior secured revolving credit facility which expires in June 2004 to provide backup support to the VIEs commercial paper program. FPL has provided an unconditional guarantee of the payment obligations of the VIE under the notes and credit facility, which are included in the table of commitments below. At December 31, 2003, the VIE had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and approximately $19 million under the commercial paper program. In additio n, FPL Energy consolidated approximately $360 million variable rate notes payable issued by a VIE in June 2002 and maturing in December 2007. At December 31, 2003, the balance of the notes payable was approximately $356 million. The proceeds of the notes were used by the VIE to complete the acquisition, development and construction of a power generation plant. FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain obligations under the debt agreement. This VIE also entered into two identical interest rate swap agreements in 2002 with an aggregate original notional amount of $106 million to fix the interest rate on a portion of this debt at 4.41%. The interest rate swap agreements expire in December 2007. Quarterly principal payments on the notes began in March 2003. For further discussion of VIEs, see Note 10. FPL Group and its subsidiaries also entered into five interest rate swap agreements during 2003. The swaps consisted of three variable interest rate swap agreements at FPL Group Capital to protect $475 million of its outstanding fixed rate debentures (with interest rates ranging from 6 7/8% to 7 5/8%) against changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates and two interest rate swap agreements at FPL Energy to fix the interest rates at rates ranging from 3.557% to 4.245% in order to limit cash flow exposure on a total of $294 million of variable rate debt. In January 2004, FPL sold 200,000 shares of $100 par value 4 1/2% Series V preferred stock to FPL Group and issued $240 million of 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035. Also in January 2004, FPL Group Capital entered into a variable interest rate swap agreement to protect $200 million of its outstanding 1 7/8% fixed rate debentures against changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates. For further discussion of preferred stock and debt activity, see Notes 14 and 15, respectively. The following provides various metrics regarding FPL Group and FPLs outstanding debt: FPL Group FPL December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 2003 2002 Weighted average annual interest rate 4.9 % 5.5 % 4.5 % 5.3 % Weighted average life (years) (a) 7.3 6.0 13.6 10.1 Annual average of floating rate debt to total debt 31 % 29 % 33 % 34 % (a) For comparability purposes, 2002 reflects debt related to VIEs consolidated July 1, 2003. FPL Groups charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of FPL Group to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, primarily FPL. In February 2004, FPL Group announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.60 to $0.62 per share. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, FPL paid, as dividends to FPL Group, its net income available to FPL Group on a one month lag basis. In addition in 2002, FPL paid special dividends totaling $375 million to FPL Group. FPL Group made capital contributions in 2003, 2002 and 2001 to FPL of $600 million, $350 million and $400 million, respectively. FPLs charter and mortgage contain provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to FPL Group and the issuance of additional unsecured debt, preferred stock and first mortg age bonds. In light of FPLs current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations. Under FPLs charter, dividends may be paid on FPLs common stock only after payment or provision for payment of dividends which are then accrued and owing on FPLs preferred stock, and only to the extent that the payment of such common stock dividends would not cause the common stock equity to be less than 25% of total capitalization of FPL or, if the common stock equity would be less than 20% or 25%, as the case may be, of the total capitalization of FPL, then such dividends may not exceed 50% or 75%, respectively, of the net income of FPL for the preceding 12 months available for dividends on the common stock. Under this test, FPL could have paid dividends in excess of $3 billion at December 31, 2003 after giving effect to the January 2004 issuances of the 200,000 shares of $100 par value 4 1/2% Series V preferred stock and the $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035. Under the mortgage securing FPLs first mortgage bonds, in some case s, the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPLs use of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2003, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage. While FPLs preferred stock remains outstanding, FPLs charter limits the amount of its unsecured indebtedness (without the consent of the preferred shareholders), for purposes other than (a) the refunding of outstanding unsecured indebtedness; (b) the reacquisition, redemption or other retirement of any indebtedness issued or assumed by FPL; or (c) the reacquisition, redemption or other retirement of all outstanding shares of FPLs outstanding preferred stock and all outstanding shares of any other class or series of stock ranking on a parity with the outstanding preferred stock. For other purposes, the allowed aggregate principal amount of unsecured indebtedness is 20% of the aggregate of the total principal amount of all bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness issued or assumed by FPL and the capital and surplus of FPL. Under this test after giving effect to the January 2004 issuance of $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds matur ing in 2035, FPL could have issued in excess of $450 million of additional unsecured debt at December 31, 2003 for purposes other than those described above. Under FPLs charter, the issuance of additional shares of FPL preferred stock (except junior preferred) is prohibited unless (a) net income available for payment of dividends on all the preferred stock including the shares to be issued for a period of 12 consecutive months within the last 15 months immediately preceding the issuance is at least twice the annual dividend requirements on all the preferred stock including the shares to be issued; and (b) gross income (after depreciation and taxes) for a period of 12 consecutive months within the 15 months immediately prior to such issuance shall have been at least 1.5 times the sum of annual interest charges on all indebtedness and annual dividend requirements on all the preferred stock (including the shares to be issued). Currently, the gross income test is the more restrictive of the two tests, and under that test, after giving effect to the January 2004 issuances of the 200,000 shares of $100 par value 4 1/2% Serie s V preferred stock and the $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 would have been in excess of 4 times the sum of annual interest charges on all indebtedness and annual dividend requirements on all the preferred stock. FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPLs first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior FPL indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, after giving effect to the January 2004 issuance of the $240 million 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003, would have been in excess of 9 times the annual interest requirements and in excess of 5 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. As of December 31, 2003, after giving effect to the issuance in January 2004 of the $240 million of 5.65% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2035, FPL could have issued in excess of $4.5 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.5 billion based on retired first mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2003, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes. FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of debt outstanding. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities maintained by FPL Group Capital and FPL, the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating is not a condition to drawing upon those credit facilities. However, commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings and would increase or decrease when ratings are changed. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities, and could result in the requirement that FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, post collateral under certain power purchase and other agreements. FPL G roup subsidiaries, including FPL, are regularly required to post collateral in excess of collateral threshold amounts when FPL Groups exposure to the counterparty under the applicable trading agreement exceeds such threshold. Securities of FPL Group and its subsidiaries are currently rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). At February 26, 2004, Moodys, S&P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital: FPL Group: Moodys (a) S&P (a) Fitch (a) Corporate credit rating N/A A A FPL: Corporate credit rating A1 A/A 1 N/A First mortgage bonds Aa3 A AA Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds Aa3/VMIG 1 A/A 1 A+ Preferred stock A3 BBB+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 FPL Group Capital: Corporate credit rating N/A A/A 1 N/A Debentures A2 A A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 (a) A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The outlook indicated by Moodys for the ratings of FPL is stable, while the outlook for the ratings of FPL Group Capital is negative reflecting uncertainty in the wholesale generation market. In July 2003, Fitch initiated coverage of FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital and indicated a stable outlook for each company. In October 2003, S&P affirmed the "A" corporate credit rating for FPL Group and subsidiaries and maintained a negative outlook. FPL Groups commitments by segment at December 31, 2003 were as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (millions) Long term debt: FPL $ $ 500 $ 135 $ $ 200 $ 2,258 $ 3,093 FPL Energy 91 119 116 418 315 705 1,764 Corporate and Other 276 675 1,100 1,075 506 630 4,262 Standby letters of credit: FPL 11 11 FPL Energy 291 291 Corporate and Other 4 4 Guarantees: FPL FPL Energy 62 95 17 220 394 Corporate and Other 2 2 Other commitments: FPL (a) 1,645 1,650 1,565 1,540 1,230 7,630 FPL Energy (b) 171 69 49 64 47 717 1,117 Corporate and Other (c) 157 46 203 Total $ 2,708 $ 3,156 $ 2,965 $ 3,114 $ 2,298 $ 4,530 $ 18,771 (a) Represents estimated capital expenditures through 2008 to meet increased electricity usage and customer growth, as well as capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities. Excludes capacity payments under purchased power and fuel contracts which are recoverable through various cost recovery clauses. (b) Represents firm commitments primarily in connection with natural gas transportation and storage, firm transmission service, nuclear fuel and a portion of its capital expenditures. (c) See Note 17 Commitments. FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of FPL Energy and its subsidiaries. FPL Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group Capital, including most of those under FPL Group Capitals debt, including all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its guarantees. See guarantees in table above. FPL Energy has guaranteed certain performance obligations of a power plant owned by a wholly owned subsidiary as part of a power purchase agreement (PPA) that expires in 2027. Under the PPA, the subsidiary could incur market based liquidated damages for failure to meet contractual minimum outputs. In addition, certain subsidiaries of FPL Energy have contracts that require certain projects to meet annual minimum generation amounts. Failure to meet the annual minimum generation amounts would result in the FPL Energy subsidiary incurring specified liquidated damages. Based on past performance of these and similar projects and current forward prices, management believes that the exposure associated with these guarantees is not material. FPL self insures for damage to certain transmission and distribution properties and maintains a funded storm and property insurance reserve to reduce the financial impact of storm losses. The balance of the storm fund reserve at December 31, 2003 was approximately $327 million, representing the amount in the storm fund (approximately $200 million) plus related deferred income taxes (approximately $127 million). The FPSC has indicated that it would consider future storm losses in excess of the funded reserve for possible recovery from customers. FPLs bank lines of credit discussed above are also available if needed to provide cash for storm restoration costs. New Accounting Rules and Interpretations Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations Effective January 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." See Note 16. Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which was subsequently revised. See Note 10. Derivative Instruments Effective July 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted FAS 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." There was no financial statement impact upon adoption of FAS 149. However, the statement could have a significant future impact on the number of contracts that will be marked to market through earnings. Effective October 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. (EITF) 03 11, which provides guidance on whether to report realized gains or losses on physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes on a gross or net basis and requires realized gains or losses on derivative contracts that net settle to be reported on a net basis. In addition, effective October 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted the SEC staff guidance requiring the realized and unrealized effects of derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges to b e reported within the same caption on the statements of income. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Note 3. Guarantees Effective January 1, 2003, FPL Group and FPL adopted FIN 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." See Note 17 Commitments. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity In May 2003, the FASB issued FAS 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," which was effective July 1, 2003. The primary change in accounting for FPL Group resulting from FAS 150 is the accounting treatment of mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests in subsidiaries with finite lives. In October 2003, the FASB deferred indefinitely the adoption of the FAS 150 provisions relating to mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests in subsidiaries with finite lives. The remaining provisions of FAS 150 did not have a financial statement impact for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, the FASB continues to address other FAS 150 implementation issues, none of which affect FPL Group or FPL currently but may affect them in the future. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the FASB issued FAS 132 (revised 2003), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," which expanded disclosures related to FPL Groups pension and postretirement plans. In January 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106 1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." See Note 2. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions where amounts are not subject to precise measurement or are dependent on future events. Critical accounting policies and estimates, which are important to the portrayal of both FPL Groups and FPLs financial condition and results of operations and which require complex, subjective judgments are as follows: Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities On January 1, 2001, FPL Group and FPL adopted FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities," as amended. FPL Group and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily forward purchases and sales, swaps, options and futures) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in fuel and electricity contracts, as well as to optimize the value of power generation assets and related contracts. To a lesser extent, FPL Group also engages in limited energy trading activities to take advantage of expected favorable price movements. These accounting pronouncements, which require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, apply not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. FAS 133 requires that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally developed models. The estimation of fair value for long term contracts requires the use of internally developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and fuel. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. In general, the models estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the prices in the contract and the forward prices. The market for electricity in the first one to three years of a contract is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed. Factors used in developing forward curves for electricity include the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contract. Substantially all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by FPL are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel and capacity clauses. In the non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, changes in the derivatives fair values are recognized in current earnings, unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met. For those transactions for which hedge accounting can be applied, much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, rather than being recognized in current earnings. Since FAS 133 became effective in 2001, the FASB has discussed and, from time to time, issued implementation guidance related to FAS 133. In particular, much of the interpretive guidance affects when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from the provisions of FAS 133. Despite the large volume of implementation guidance, FAS 133 and the supplemental guidance does not provide specific guidance on all contract issues. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying FAS 133 and its interpretations. The interpretation of FAS 133 continues to evolve. One possible result of changes in interpretation could be that certain contracts would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. During the fourth quarter of 2003, FPL Group and its subsidiaries adopted EITF 03 11, which precluded certain economic hedging transactions at FPL Energy from qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. Those transactions will now be marked to market and reported in the non qualifying hedge category and are likely to result in more volatility in the non qualifying hedge category in the future. The ongoing changes in accounting guidance relating to derivatives confirm managements belief in the importance of segregating the effects of the unrealized mark to market impact of non qualifying hedges. Without any change in FPL Groups economic positions or the timing or amounts of future cash flows, a small change in classification of particular transactions can result in significant changes in net income. This could be significant to FPL Energys results because the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to marke t (the physical assets themselves) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. Because of this, FPL Groups management continues to view results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3. Accounting for Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits FPL Group sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries. In addition, FPL Group sponsors a substantially contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits (other benefits) for retirees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements who elect participation at the time of retirement. The pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits. The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance. FPL Groups pension income net of the cost of other benefits was approximately $84 million, $82 million and $84 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The corresponding amounts allocated to FPL were $64 million, $73 million and $77 million, respectively. Pension income and the cost of other benefits are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all years, assumed increases in future compensation levels of 4.5% for 2003 and 5.5% for 2002 and 2001, and a weighted average discount rate of 6.00%, 6.25% and 6.75% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Based on current health care costs (as related to other benefits), the projected 2004 trend assumptions used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the plans are 9.5% for all age groups. The rat e is assumed to decrease over the next nine years to the ultimate trend rate of 5% for all age groups and remain at that level thereafter. In developing these assumptions, FPL Group evaluated input from its actuaries, as well as information available in the market place. For the expected long term rate of return on fund assets, FPL Group considered 10 year and 20 year historical median returns for a portfolio with a 50/50 equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds. FPL Group also considered its funds historical compounded returns. FPL Group believes that 7.75% is a reasonable long term rate of return on its plans assets. FPL Group will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as necessary. FPL Group bases its determination of pension and other benefits expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits expense and income only when they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or th e market related value of assets. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would have reduced FPL Groups net income for 2003 by approximately $14 million ($12 million for FPL). Lowering the discount rate assumption by 0.5% would have decreased FPL Groups net income for 2003 by approximately $6 million ($5 million for FPL). Raising the salary increase assumption by 0.5% would have decreased FPL Groups net income for 2003 by approximately $2 million ($2 million for FPL). Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. An increase or decrease of 1% in assumed health care cost trend rates would have a corresponding effect on the service and interest cost components and the accumulated obligation of other benefits of approximately $1 million and $9 million, respectively. The fair value of plan assets has increased from $2.4 billion at September 30, 2002 to $2.7 billion at September 30, 2003 for the pension plan and from $45 million at September 30, 2002 to $54 million at September 30, 2003 for other benefits. Management believes that, based on the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, FPL Group will not be required to make any cash contributions to the pension plan in the near future. FPL Group anticipates making cash contributions of approximately $27 million to the postretirement plan during 2004 and is studying the feasibility of transferring pension plan assets to fund claims associated with retiree medical benefits, as allowed by current tax law. See Note 2. Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets FPL Group evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable as described in FAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Under that standard, an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the assets fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized. Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil Dismantlement For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the FPSC at least every five years. The most recent studies, which became effective May 2002, indicate that FPLs portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage, is $6.4 billion, or $2.1 billion in 2003 dollars. Beginning January 1, 2003, FPL began recognizing nuclear decommissioning liabilities in accordance with FAS 143, which requires that a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation (ARO) be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the offsetting associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. At December 31, 2003, $2,009 million was accrued for nuclear decommissioning, of which $1,907 million was recorded as an ARO, $22 2 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $181 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $143 million was included in accrued asset removal costs. See Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plant and Dismantlement of Fossil Plant and Note 16. FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC at least every four years. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, fossil dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies, which became effective January 1, 2003, indicated that FPLs portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil units is $668 million. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered an ARO under FAS 143. At December 31, 2003, the provision for fossil dismantlement was approximately $274 million and is included in accrued asset removal costs. FPL Energy records a liability for the present value of Seabrooks expected decommissioning costs in accordance with FAS 143. Comprehensive studies are filed with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee every four years, with updates provided annually. These studies indicate that FPL Energys 88.23% portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning Seabrook, including costs associated with spent fuel storage, is $1.5 billion, or $553 million in 2003 dollars. At December 31, 2003, the ARO for Seabrooks nuclear decommissioning totaled approximately $163 million. See Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plant and Dismantlement of Fossil Plant and Note 16. The calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs, involves the use of estimates and judgments concerning the amount and timing of future expenditures and whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation under FAS 143. FPL Group and FPL also make interest rate, rate of return and inflation projections to determine funding requirements related to decommissioning. Periodically, FPL Group and FPL will be required to update their estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Regulatory Accounting FPL follows the accounting practices set forth in FAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." FAS 71 indicates that regulators can create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. If FPL were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new fa cilities. The continued applicability of FAS 71 is assessed at each reporting period. See Note 1 Regulation. See Note 1 for a discussion of FPL Groups and FPLs other significant accounting policies. Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity Energy Marketing and Trading Certain of FPL Groups subsidiaries, including FPL and FPL Energy, use derivative instruments (primarily forward purchases and sales, swaps, options and futures) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in fuel and electricity contracts, as well as to optimize the value of power generation assets. To a lesser extent, FPL Energy engages in limited energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Derivative instruments are recorded on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability (in derivative assets, other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities) measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause and the capacity clause. For FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized net in operating revenues for trading and managed hedge activities and in the same line item as the stated realized amounts for non qualifying hedges in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income unless hedge accounting is applied. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the statements of income to which they relate. See Note 3. The changes in the fair value of FPL Groups consolidated subsidiaries energy contract derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were as follows: Hedges on Owned Assets Proprietary Trading Managed Non Qualifying OCI FPL Cost Recovery Clauses FPL Group Total (millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 $ 4 $ $ 8 $ 28 $ 12 $ 52 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (9) (1 ) 12 (57 ) (3 ) (58 ) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI 18 18 Changes in valuation assumptions 2 2 (a) Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 12 2 (1 ) 85 98 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003 7 1 21 (11 ) 94 112 Net option premium payment (receipts) (12 ) 35 23 Total mark to market energy contract net assets at December 31, 2003 $ 7 $ 1 $ 9 $ (11 ) $ 129 $ 135 (a) Change in valuation assumption from applying volatility skewness (selection of an input assumption among alternatives based on the projected moneyness of the option) in option valuation. FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets at December 31, 2003 shown above are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows: December 31, 2003 (millions) Derivative assets $ 187 Other assets 17 Other current liabilities (44 ) Other liabilities (25 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets at December 31, 2003 $ 135 The sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at December 31, 2003 were as follows: Maturity 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (millions) Proprietary Trading: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices $ 1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1 Prices provided by other external sources 2 2 Modeled 1 1 2 4 Total 3 1 1 2 7 Owned Assets Managed: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 1 1 Prices provided by other external sources Modeled Total 1 1 Owned Assets Non Qualifying: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 1 1 Prices provided by other external sources 30 30 Modeled (9 ) (1 ) (10 ) Total 21 21 Owned Assets OCI: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 9 (3 ) 6 Prices provided by other external sources (8 ) (2 ) (1 ) (11 ) Modeled (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) (2 ) (1 ) (6 ) Total (6 ) (2 ) (2 ) (1 ) (11 ) Owned Assets FPL Cost Recovery Clauses: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange trade) prices 53 53 Prices provided by other external sources 21 1 22 Modeled 18 1 19 Total 92 1 1 94 Total sources of fair value $ 117 $ (4 ) $ $ (2 ) $ (1 ) $ 2 $ 112 Market Risk Sensitivity Substantially all financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of FPL Group and FPL described below are held for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks. FPL Groups Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, is responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. FPL Group and FPL manage their interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates an d adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. FPL Group and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. FPL Group manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees. Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. FPL Groups credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. Commodity price risk FPL Group uses a value at risk (VaR) model to measure market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the VaR figures are as follows: Trading and Managed Hedges Non Qualifying Hedges and Hedges in OCI (a) Total FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group (millions) December 31, 2002 $ $ $ $ 1 $ 3 $ 4 $ 1 $ 3 $ 4 December 31, 2003 $ $ $ $ 25 (b) $ 5 $ 26 $ 25 (b) $ 4 $ 26 Average for the period ended December 31, 2003 $ $ $ $ 11 $ 4 $ 13 $ 11 $ 3 $ 13 (a) Non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements. (b) In 2003, FPL expanded its fuel hedge program. Interest rate risk FPL Group and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and interest rate swaps. FPL Group and FPL manage their interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates and adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. The following are estimates of the fair value of FPL Groups and FPLs financial instruments: December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (millions) FPL Group: Long term debt, including current maturities $ 9,090 $ 9,548 (a) $ 5,895 $ 6,222 (a) Fixed income securities: Special Use Funds $ 1,316 $ 1,316 (a) $ 1,184 $ 1,184 (a) Other investments $ 57 $ 57 (a) $ 41 $ 41 (a) Interest rate swaps net unrealized loss $ (10 ) $ (10 ) (b) $ $ FPL: Long term debt, including current maturities $ 3,074 $ 3,193 (a) $ 2,434 $ 2,578 (a) Fixed income securities Special Use Funds $ 1,188 $ 1,188 (a) $ 1,066 $ 1,066 (a) (a) Based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues. (b) Based on market prices provided by external sources or modeled internally. The special use funds of FPL Group include restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of FPL Groups and FPLs nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value. Adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL. The market value adjustments of FPL Groups non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer term securities, as decommissioning activities are not expected to begin until at least 2012. See Note 11. FPL Group and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to adjust and mitigate interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements. At December 31, 2003, FPL Group had the following interest rate swaps: Notional Amount Effective Date Maturity Date Rate Paid Rate Received Estimated Fair Value (millions) (millions) Fair value hedges FPL Group Capital: $ 150 July 2003 September 2006 variable (a) 7.625 % $ (2 ) $ 150 July 2003 September 2006 variable (b) 7.625 % (2 ) $ 175 December 2003 June 2004 variable (c) 6.875 % 1 Total fair value hedges (3 ) Cash flow hedges FPL Energy: $ 103 July 2002 December 2007 4.41 % variable (d) (4 ) $ 200 August 2003 November 2007 3.557 % variable (d) (2 ) $ 94 December 2003 December 2017 4.245 % variable (e) (1 ) Total cash flow hedges (7 ) Total interest rate hedges $ (10 ) (a) Six month LIBOR plus 4.9900% (b) Six month LIBOR plus 4.9925% (c) Six month LIBOR plus 4.8921% (d) Three month LIBOR (e) One month LIBOR Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near term market change, the net fair value of FPL Groups net liabilities would increase by approximately $212 million ($89 million for FPL) at December 31, 2003. Equity price risk Included in the special use funds of FPL Group are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $926 million and $689 million ($781 million and $578 million for FPL) at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near term market change, would result in a $93 million ($78 million for FPL) reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL, or adjustments to OCI for FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, at December 31, 2003. Credit risk For all derivative and contractual transactions, FPL Group and its subsidiaries energy marketing and trading operations are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Relevant considerations when assessing FPL Group and its subsidiaries energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include: Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry. Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the United States. Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of cash collateral.
