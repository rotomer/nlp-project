Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. In the discussion of Results of Operations below, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. Overview FPL Group is one of the nations largest providers of electricity related services. Its principal subsidiary, FPL, serves more than 8.5 million people throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida. FPL Energy, FPL Groups competitive energy subsidiary, produces electricity primarily utilizing natural gas, wind and nuclear resources. Together, FPLs and FPL Energys generating assets represented approximately 34,300 mw of capacity at December 31, 2006. FPL FiberNet provides fiber optic services to FPL, telecommunications companies and other customers throughout Florida. FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the retail sale of electricity. FPL expects the 2005 rate agreement to be in effect through December 31, 2009. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates. Over the last ten years, FPLs average annual customer growth has been 2.2% while usage growth per customer has been 0.7%. FPL is meeting the increased electricity demands of its customers by adding to its generation capacity and electric transmission and distribution infrastructure. FPL is currently constructing Turkey Point Unit No. 5, a 1,144 mw natural gas fired combined cycle plant, which is expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2007, for a total investment of approximately $580 million. FPLs expects to build two approximately 1,220 mw natural gas fired combined cycle units in western Palm Beach County, Florida with planned in service dates of 2009 and 2010 at an expected cost of approximately $1.3 billion. In additio n, FPL filed a need application with the FPSC in 2007 to build two ultra super critical pulverized coal generating units totaling approximately 1,960 mw in Glades County, Florida with planned in service dates of 2013 and 2014 at an expected cost of approximately $5.7 billion. FPL is in the process of evaluating the economics, risks and advisability, among other things, of potentially building a new nuclear power plant in its service area. FPLs business strategy is to continue meeting the increased demands of customers in a safe, reliable, cost effective manner while focusing on operating performance. FPLs O&M expenses again increased in 2006 reflecting higher transmission and distribution costs and the cost of FPLs Storm Secure Plan, as well as higher nuclear, customer service and employee medical costs. In addition, in 2006 the FPSC applied a different standard for recovery of 2005 storm costs than was used for the 2004 storm costs and, accordingly, FPL expensed approximately $27 million, after tax and net of interest, of disallowed 2005 storm costs. Management expects O&M expenses in 2007 to continue trending upward reflecting as much as a $30 million increase in Storm Secure Plan costs, higher fossil generation costs reflecting the placement of Turkey Point Unit No. 5 into service, and higher employee benefit, customer service and insurance costs. FPL Energy is in the competitive energy business with the majority of its operating revenues derived from wholesale electricity sales. Its business strategy is to maximize the value of its current portfolio, expand its U.S. market leading wind position and build its portfolio through asset acquisitions. FPL Energys market is diversified by region as well as by fuel source. FPL Energy sells a large percentage of its expected capacity to hedge against price volatility. If FPL Energys plants do not perform as expected, this high degree of hedging could result in FPL Energy being required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. FPL Energys energy marketing and trading business is focused on reducing commodity price risk and extracting maximum value from its assets. FPL Energy, through its subsidiaries, is one of the largest producers of wind energy in the world, and with the extension of the pr oduction tax credit program through December 2008, plans to continue expanding its wind portfolio in 2007 and 2008 through construction of new facilities and selective acquisitions. FPL Group and its subsidiaries segregate unrealized mark to market gains and losses on derivative transactions into two categories. The first category, referred to as trading activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts. The second category, referred to as non qualifying hedges, represents the net unrealized effect of derivative transactions entered into as economic hedges (but which do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended) and the ineffective portion of transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges. FPL Group uses derivative instruments to reduce its commodity price and interest rate risk. FPL Groups management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings), which in 2006 were the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges and merger related expenses, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as inputs in determining whether performance targets are met for performance based compensation under FPL Groups employee incentive compensation plans. FPL Group also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its earnings outlook to investors. FPL Groups management believes adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. FPL Group and FPL adopted a FASB Staff Position (FSP) related to planned major maintenance activities (Major Maintenance FSP) effective December 31, 2006. The Major Maintenance FSP eliminates the accrue in advance method for recognizing costs associated with planned major maintenance activities. This FSP requires retrospective application and, accordingly, all prior period reported results of FPL Group and FPL Energy have been adjusted to reflect this change. FPL will continue to apply the accrue in advance method in accordance with regulatory treatment and, accordingly, this change resulted in the reclassification of its accrued major maintenance costs to a regulatory liability. See Note 1 Major Maintenance Costs. Results of Operations Summary Presented below is a summary of net income by reportable segment (see Note 17): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (millions) FPL $ 802 $ 748 $ 749 FPL Energy 610 203 181 Corporate and Other (131 ) (50 ) (34 ) FPL Group Consolidated $ 1,281 $ 901 $ 896 FPLs 2006 improved results reflect lower depreciation and amortization expense and customer growth partly offset by the expensing of disallowed 2005 storm costs and higher O&M expenses. FPLs results for 2005 reflect strong customer growth and higher average electricity usage per retail customer despite the impact of increased hurricane activity, which were more than offset by higher O&M expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and interest charges. FPL Energys 2006 results reflect an approximately $97 million gain ($63 million after tax) resulting from a court judgment relating to an Indonesian project that was suspended in 1998, additional earnings from new investments and improved results from the existing portfolio. FPL Energys 2005 results improved primarily due to improved market conditions and the favorable effects of contract restructuring activities and asset sales, as well as project additions partially offset by higher interest expense. In addition, FPL Groups and FPL Energys net income for 2006 reflect net unrealized after tax gains from non qualifying hedges of $92 million while 2005 and 2004 net income reflect net unrealized after tax losses from non qualifying hedges of $112 million and $3 million, respectively. While the unrealized marked to market gains and losses on non qualifying hedge activity may be significant in any given period, the cumulative impact on FPL Groups balance sheet at December 31 , 2006 was not material. The change in unrealized mark to market activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains/losses as the underlying transactions are realized. As a general rule, a gain (loss) in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under generally accepted accounting principles. Results for Corporate and Other in 2006 reflect a $98 million ($60 million after tax) impairment charge related to FPL FiberNets metro market assets as a result of significant changes in the business climate in which FPL FiberNet operates. In addition, Corporate and Others 2006 results reflect approximately $14 million of after tax merger costs associated with the proposed merger between FPL Group and Constellation Energy, which was terminated in October 2006. See Note 2 for information about the terminated merger, Note 5 Corporate and Other for FPL FiberNet impairment charge and Note 17 for segment information. FPL Groups effective tax rate for all periods presented reflects PTCs for wind projects at FPL Energy. PTCs can significantly affect FPL Groups effective tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income and wind generation. See Note 1 Income Taxes and Note 6. FPL FPLs net income available to FPL Group for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $802 million, $748 million and $749 million, respectively. During 2006, FPLs net income benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense, continued customer growth and certain federal income tax deductions and credits. These factors were partially offset by higher O&M and property tax expenses, the disallowance of certain storm costs and a slight decline in customer usage. During 2005, FPLs net income benefited from strong customer growth and increased customer usage due to overall improved weather conditions. However, the impact of increased hurricane activity, higher depreciation and amortization expense and increased O&M and interest expenses more than offset these benefits. In the second quarter of 2006, when considering FPLs petition to recover 2005 storm costs, the FPSC applied a different standard for recovery of 2005 costs than was used for recovery of the 2004 storm costs. This resulted in certain adjustments and disallowances of storm costs that FPL sought to recover, which reduced FPL Groups and FPLs 2006 net income by approximately $27 million. In 2005, the FPSC approved the 2005 rate agreement regarding FPLs retail base rates signed by FPL and all of the interveners in its 2005 rate case filing. FPL expects the 2005 rate agreement to be in effect through December 31, 2009. The 2005 rate agreement replaced a rate agreement that was effective April 15, 2002 through December 31, 2005. The 2005 rate agreement provides that retail base rates will not increase during the term of the agreement except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of any power plant approved pursuant to the Siting Act that achieves commercial operation during the term of the 2005 rate agreement. Retail base rates will increase approximately $127 million on an annualized basis when Turkey Point Unit No. 5 is placed in service, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2007. The 2005 rate agreement also continues the revenue sharing mechanism in FPLs 2002 rate agreement, whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of certain thresholds will be shared with customers on the basis of two thirds refunded to customers and one third retained by FPL. Revenues from retail base operations in excess of a second, higher threshold (cap) will be refunded 100% to customers. The revenue sharing threshold and cap is adjusted each year. For the years end ed December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, revenues from retail base operations did not exceed the thresholds for those years. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates for information on the calculation of the threshold and cap and for information on FPLs regulatory ROE. The 2005 rate agreement, among other things, requires FPL to use electric property depreciation rates based upon comprehensive depreciation studies filed with the FPSC in March 2005 and permits FPL to continue to reduce annual depreciation by up to $125 million, which FPL has been doing since 2002. The 2005 rate agreement suspended contributions of approximately $79 million per year to the nuclear decommissioning fund beginning in September 2005. The 2005 rate agreement also suspended, beginning in 2006, contributions of $20.3 million per year to the storm and property insurance reserve but allows FPL to recover prudently incurred storm restoration costs, either through securitization pursuant to a state financing statute or surcharges. FPLs operating revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (millions) Retail base $ 3,657 $ 3,658 $ 3,548 Fuel cost recovery 6,573 4,283 3,877 Other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs 1,588 1,368 1,122 Other, primarily gas, transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees 170 219 187 Total $ 11,988 $ 9,528 $ 8,734 For the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase in the average number of customers of 2.0% increased retail base revenues by approximately $74 million. During this period, usage per retail customer decreased 0.4% primarily due to warmer weather experienced in 2005 and the elasticity effect on customers of higher electricity prices in 2006 reflecting the increase in FPLs retail fuel clause recovery factor as discussed below. This decrease in usage per retail customer was partly offset by the absence of hurricane activity in 2006 compared to the 2005 activity that caused customer service interruptions throughout FPLs service territory. This usage decrease, as well as other factors, decreased retail base revenues by approximately $23 million. In addition, under the 2005 rate agreement, FPL was authorized by the FPSC to collect, through a separate charge on a customer bill, the portion (approximately 1.5%) of gross receipts taxes that was previously embedded in bas e rates. This resulted in an approximately $52 million reduction in retail base revenues with a corresponding increase in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, a 2.3% increase in the average number of customer accounts increased revenue from retail base operations by approximately $82 million while the balance of the increase, or $28 million, was primarily due to a 0.5% increase in usage per retail customer. The majority of the growth in usage was due to the effects of overall improved weather conditions which was partially offset by increased hurricane activity in 2005 that caused customer service interruptions throughout FPLs service territory. The 2005 and 2004 hurricanes resulted in lost revenues of approximately $52 million and $38 million, respectively. Revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs, such as franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm cost recoveries, do not significantly affect net income; however, underrecovery or overrecovery of such costs can significantly affect FPL Groups and FPLs operating cash flows. Fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, as well as by changes in energy sales. Fluctuations in other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs revenues are primarily driven by changes in capacity charges, franchise fee costs and storm reserve deficiency amortization, and the impact of changes in O&M and depreciation expense on the underlying cost recovery clause, as well as changes in energy sales. Capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. Ordinarily, the fuel charge is set annually based on estimated fuel costs and estimated customer usage, plus or minus a true up for prior period estimates. FPL utilizes an FPSC approved risk management fuel procurement program, which is intended to reduce the risk of unexpected fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. The results of the program are reviewed by the FPSC as part of the annual review of fuel costs. In response to higher fuel prices, in January 2006 and January 2005 the retail fuel clause recovery factor was increased approximately 46% and 7%, respectively. This was the primary contributor to the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues in 2006 and 2005. The retail fuel clause recovery factor for 2007 was reduced approximately 7.2% in January 2007 primarily in response to expected fuel price changes. This factor will decline again by another 2.3% during the second quarter of 2007 whe n Turkey Point Unit No. 5 is placed in service, although a typical 1,000 kwh residential bill will remain the same because the previously discussed base rate increase for this unit will offset the fuel clause recovery factor decline. In February 2005, FPL began recovering the 2004 storm restoration cost deficiency from retail customers. These revenues are included in other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount billed to customers related to these storm restoration cost recoveries amounted to approximately $151 million and $155 million, respectively, and the corresponding expense for the amortization of the storm reserve deficiency is shown as a separate line on the consolidated statements of income. For further discussion, see Note 1 Storm Reserve Deficiency. The decrease in other revenues in 2006 is primarily due to the transfer, effective January 1, 2006, of FPLs retail gas contracts to a subsidiary of FPL Group Capital, which also reduced FPLs fuel expense by approximately $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in other revenues in 2005 was primarily due to higher retail gas revenues. The major components of FPLs fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (millions) Fuel and energy charges during the period $ 5,662 $ 5,213 $ 3,742 Recovery of costs incurred in a prior period 743 140 345 Net over (under) recovery of costs during the period 194 (1,027 ) (188 ) Other, primarily capacity charges net of any capacity deferral 517 584 568 Total $ 7,116 $ 4,910 $ 4,467 Effective January 2006, FPLs fuel clause recovery factor was increased in response to higher expected fuel prices in 2006, as well as the recovery of a portion of underrecovered fuel costs from 2005. The increase in the fuel factor was the primary contributor to the $935 million decrease in deferred clause and franchise expenses (current and noncurrent, collectively) on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006, and positively affected FPL Groups and FPLs cash flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in fuel and energy charges in 2006 reflects higher fuel and energy prices of approximately $415 million and approximately $98 million attributable to higher energy sales partly offset by approximately $64 million related to the transfer of FPLs retail gas business. The increase in fuel and energy charges in 2005 reflects higher fuel energy prices of approximately $1,352 million, approximately $98 million attrib utable to higher energy sales and $21 million related to higher retail gas costs. The recovery of costs incurred in a prior period represents the collection of underrecovered fuel costs the FPSC permitted FPL to start collecting at the beginning of the year. The net overrecovery (underrecovery) of costs during the period represents fuel clause collections from customers which were higher (lower) than fuel and energy costs incurred. FPLs O&M expenses increased approximately $67 million in 2006 primarily due to higher transmission and distribution costs and costs associated with FPLs Storm Secure Plan totaling approximately $39 million, higher nuclear costs of approximately $38 million, excluding the sleeving and reactor vessel head amortization cost reductions discussed below, and higher employee benefit costs, primarily medical, of approximately $10 million. In addition, customer service costs increased approximately $19 million reflecting additional staffing needs and higher uncollectible accounts as a result of higher customer bills. These factors were partially offset by the suspension in 2006 of approximately $20 million of contributions to the storm and property insurance reserve in accordance with the 2005 rate agreement. The increase in nuclear costs were substantially offset by a partial reversal in 2006 of sleeving costs recorded in 2005 that FPL expected to spend, but did not, during the spring 2006 outage of the St. Lucie Unit No. 2 nuclear plant in order to comply with the NRC regulations concerning tube plugging in the units two steam generators and by lower reactor vessel head amortization costs. The reactor vessel head inspection costs reflect the amortization over a five year period that began in 2002, as authorized by the FPSC, of the estimated cost of performing inspections for cracks and corrosion and making any necessary repair to the reactor vessel heads at all four of FPLs nuclear facilities until replacement. No cracking was detected and no repairs were needed to the reactor vessel head during the spring 2006 outage at St. Lucie Unit No. 2. The reactor vessel heads at FPLs three other nuclear units were replaced in 2004 and 2005. FPL intends to replace the reactor vessel head and the steam generators at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 during its fall 2007 scheduled refueling outage. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income. Management expects O&M in 2007 to continue trending upward reflecting as much as a $30 million increase in Storm Secure Plan costs, higher fossil generation costs reflecting the placement of Turkey Point Unit No. 5 into service, and higher employee benefit, customer service and insurance costs. FPLs O&M expenses increased approximately $79 million in 2005 primarily due to higher employee benefit expenses of approximately $28 million, higher nuclear maintenance costs of approximately $19 million and higher fossil generation costs of approximately $18 million, as well as the absence of a $21 million settlement related to shareholder litigation which reduced O&M expenses in 2004. In addition, part of the O&M expense increase relates to approximately $17 million of expenses associated with increased nuclear security costs which are recovered through the capacity clause. The overall increase in O&M expenses was partially offset by a reversal of a prior year reserve of approximately $15 million related to 2004 storm costs that were subsequently determined to be recoverable pursuant to a 2005 FPSC order. Increased employee benefits expenses are primarily associated with the absence of a pension transition credit that was fu lly amortized by the end of 2004 and higher employee costs. The increase in fossil generation expense relates primarily to the introduction of the Martin and Manatee expansion as well as the timing of overhaul maintenance at some of the older generating units. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $164 million primarily benefiting from lower depreciation rates and the elimination of the decommissioning accrual approved as part of the 2005 rate agreement (a collective benefit of approximately $242 million). This reduction in depreciation rates applied to substantially all power plant assets including Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 and St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2, which have received 20 year license extensions. This was partially offset by FPLs continued investment in transmission and distribution facilities to support customer growth and demand (approximately $31 million), depreciation from the addition of two new generating units at FPLs existing Martin and Manatee power plant sites which became operational on June 30, 2005 (approximately $23 million) and increased nuclear depreciation related to plant additions (approximately $24 million). FPL expe cts to place Turkey Point Unit No. 5, a 1,144 mw natural gas fired generating unit, into service during the second quarter of 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $36 million, of which approximately $23 million related to the addition of the two new generating units at the Martin and Manatee power plant sites. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to FPLs continued investment in transmission and distribution expansion to support customer growth and demand. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was partially offset by the suspension, in September 2005, of FPLs nuclear decommissioning accrual which totaled approximately $79 million annually. Taxes other than income taxes increased $187 million and $49 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily due to higher franchise fees and revenue taxes, which are pass through costs, as a result of increases in fuel and other cost recovery clause revenues. In both 2006 and 2005, taxes other than income taxes also included higher property taxes reflecting growth in property balances. Interest charges for 2006 and 2005 increased primarily due to higher average debt balances used to fund increased investment in generation, transmission and distribution expansion, and to pay for unrecovered fuel and storm restoration costs. In addition, average interest rates in 2006 and 2005 increased approximately 20 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. The decline in AFUDC in both 2006 and 2005 is primarily attributable to the placement of the additional Martin and Manatee units in service on June 30, 2005, partially offset by increased AFUDC on Turkey Point Unit No. 5. Interest income, included in other net in FPLs consolidated statements of income, increased in 2006 and 2005 by approximately $16 million and $14 million, reflecting higher interest accrued on the unrecovered balance of the storm reserve deficiency. In 2005, interest income included interest on deferred costs associated with nuclear security, as app roved by the FPSC. FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers. The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale transactions. In 2006, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 4% of FPLs total operating revenues. Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier. Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the retail electric industry in Florida in the near future. If the basis of regulation for some or all of FPLs business changes from cost based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be w ritten off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment. See Critical Policies and Estimates Regulatory Accounting. In September 2006, the FPSC granted FPL an exemption from the FPSCs bid rule for two ultra super critical pulverized coal generating units, totaling approximately 1,960 mw and in February 2007, FPL filed a need application with the FPSC to build these units in Glades County, Florida with expected operational dates of 2013 and 2014. Effective February 2007, the FPSC eliminated the requirement for utilities to issue an RFP for new nuclear power plants sited after June 2006. Also in February 2007, the FPSC approved a nuclear cost recovery rule that provides for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs for siting, designing, licensing and constructing new nuclear power plants. FPL is in the process of evaluating the economics, risks and advisability, among other things, of potentially building a new nuclear power plant in its service area. FPL Energy FPL Energys net income for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $610 million, $203 million and $181 million, respectively, an increase in 2006 of $407 million and an increase in 2005 of $22 million. The net income amounts have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of the Major Maintenance FSP. See Note 1 Major Maintenance Costs. The primary drivers, on an after tax basis, of these increases were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (millions) New investments (a) $ 112 $ 15 Existing assets (a) 54 87 Full energy and capacity requirements services and trading 26 (2 ) Restructuring activities and asset sales (20 ) 74 Indonesian project gain 63 (5 ) Interest expense and other (32 ) (38 ) Change in unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity (b) 204 (109 ) Net income increase $ 407 $ 22 (a) Includes PTCs on wind projects but does not include allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. See Note 1 Income Taxes. Results from new projects are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation. A projects results are included in existing assets beginning with the 13th month of operation. (b) For discussion of derivative instruments, see Note 4 and Overview. The increase in FPL Energys 2006 results from new investment reflects the addition of over 1,800 mw of wind, nuclear and solar generation during or after 2005. The 2005 increase reflects over 1,300 mw of gas fired, wind and solar generation during or after 2004. The 2005 contribution was partially offset by losses associated with Gexa, a retail electric provider in Texas acquired in June 2005. In 2006, FPL Energys existing asset portfolio benefited from improved market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions and a higher wind resource. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a longer refueling outage in 2006 as compared to 2005 at the Seabrook nuclear facility. In addition, included in the existing assets line item was a $4 million after tax ($8 million pretax) impairment charge recorded by FPL Energy in 2006 related to a California coal plant. See Note 5 FPL Energy. In 2005, the existing portfolio benefited from improved market conditions in the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions as well as the favorable effect of prior contract restructurings. FPL Energy is currently planning to make alloy 600 pressurizer repairs to its Seabrook nuclear plant in 2008, but the NRC may require the repairs to be done in 2007. Performing these repairs in 2007 may reduce FPL Energys 2007 results of operations but is not expected to sig nificantly affect the estimated capital expenditures for the 2007 through 2011 period. FPL Energys 2006 financial results benefited from increased gains from its full energy and capacity requirements services and trading activities in 2006. Full energy and capacity requirements services included load following services, which require the supplier of energy to vary the quantity delivered based on the load demand needs of the customer, as well as various ancillary services. The results of restructuring activities and asset sales in 2006 were lower than 2005 reflecting the absence of gains recorded in 2005 from asset sales and from a contract restructuring, partly offset by a $12 million after tax gain recorded in 2006 on the sale of wind development rights. Restructuring activities in 2005 reflect the absence of a $48 million loss ($81 million pretax) recorded in 2004 associated with the restructuring of the Marcus Hook steam contract, which consisted of the write off of an auxiliary boiler and a payment to terminate an associated steam sales agreement. Also in 2004, FPL Energy recorded a $29 million after tax impairment loss (approximately $47 million pretax) to write down its investment in a combined cycle power plant in Texas to its fair value as a result of agreeing to sell its interest in the project. In addition, in 2004 FPL Energy recorded a net after tax gain of approximately $31 million (approximately $52 million pretax) related to the termination of a gas supply contract and a steam agreement at one of its investments in joint ventures. See Note 5 FPL Energy. The Indonesian project gain reflects a $63 million after tax gain ($97 million pretax) recorded by FPL Energy in 2006 as the result of a court judgment. A portion of the judgment (approximately $7 million pretax or $5 million after tax) was recorded by FPL Energy in 2004. See Item 3 for a discussion of pending litigation relating to the Indonesian project. In both 2006 and 2005, interest expense and other reflects higher interest expense due to higher debt balances as a result of growth in the business as well as an increase in average interest rates of approximately 38 basis points and 56 basis points for 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, interest and other in both 2006 and 2005 includes higher corporate general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the business. In 2006, FPL Energy recorded approximately $92 million of after tax net unrealized mark to market gains on non qualifying hedge activity. In 2005 and 2004, FPL Energy recorded approximately $112 million and $3 million, respectively, of net unrealized mark to market losses on non qualifying hedge activity. The change in unrealized mark to market activity for 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to decreased forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market losses as the underlying transactions were realized during 2006. The increase in 2005 in unrealized mark to market losses associated with non qualifying hedge activity was primarily attributable to increased forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains as the underlying transactions were realized during 2005. FPL Energys operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 increased $1,337 million and $516 million, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2006 benefited primarily from gains on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity in 2006 as compared to losses in the 2005 period, project additions, favorable market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions, and a higher wind resource, partially offset by the impact of the longer refueling outage in 2006 as compared to 2005 for the Seabrook nuclear facility. Also, operating revenues in 2006 include approximately $12 million related to the settlement of certain operational performance issues with wind turbine equipment suppliers. The year ended December 31, 2005 benefited primarily from improved market conditions mainly in the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions, project additions and improved hydro resources, partially offset by higher unrealized mark to market losses from non qualifying hedge activity, lower generation at Seabrook due to its scheduled spring 2005 refueling outage and a reduced wind resource. FPL Energys operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 increased $736 million and $539 million, respectively. The increase for 2006 is primarily due to unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge losses in 2006 compared to gains in 2005, project additions and increased fuel costs as a result of market conditions. The increase for 2005 is primarily driven by increased fuel prices and generation in the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions as well as by project additions which also resulted in higher O&M and depreciation and amortization expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by higher unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedge activity. Included in operating expenses in 2004 were charges of approximately $81 million associated with the restructuring of the Marcus Hook steam contract discussed above. FPL Energy expects O&M expenses to continue to increase in 2007, primarily due to costs associ ated with project additions and plant maintenance. Equity in earnings of equity method investees increased $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the $97 million Indonesian project gain discussed above and the favorable effect on operating results from a prior contract restructuring. These factors were partially offset by unrealized mark to market losses of approximately $26 million from non qualifying hedge activity in 2006 compared to an approximately $2 million gain in 2005 and the absence of an approximately $13 million pretax gain on a contract restructuring recorded in 2005. In 2005, equity in earnings of equity method investees increased primarily due to the positive effects of prior contract restructurings partially offset by lower gains of approximately $11 million from non qualifying hedge activity. In 2004, FPL Energy recorded a net pretax gain of approximately $52 million on the termination of a gas supply contract and a steam agreement. Also included in the equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2004 was the $47 million pretax impairment loss related to a combined cycle power plant in Texas discussed above. See Note 5 FPL Energy. FPL Energys interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 increased $46 million and $43 million, respectively, reflecting higher average debt balances to support growth in the business and an increase in average interest rates. Gains (losses) on disposal of assets in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income for 2006 reflect an approximately $20 million pretax gain for the sale of wind development rights. In 2005, this line item included approximately $44 million of pretax gains on the sale of FPL Energy joint venture projects. FPL Energys interest income increased by approximately $10 million in 2005 primarily related to higher investment income associated with the Seabrook decommissioning fund balance, as well as interest income associated with a bridge loan, which was originated early in 2005 in connection with an acquisition of a solar project and repaid in the third quarter of 2005. Other net for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a benefit associated with obtaining an additional partnership interest in a coal plant in California. PTCs from FPL Energys wind projects are reflected in FPL Energys earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, and amounted to approximately $167 million, $129 million and $109 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In January 2006, FPL Energy completed the acquisition of a 70% interest, or approximately 415 mw, in the Duane Arnold nuclear power plant. FPL Energy purchased the 70% interest, including nuclear fuel, inventory and other items, for a net purchase price of approximately $350 million. FPL Energy is selling substantially all of its share of the output of Duane Arnold to IP&L under a long term contract expiring in 2014. FPL Energy is responsible for management and operation of the plant, as well as for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility, the cost of which will be shared on a pro rata basis by the joint owners. FPL Energy received approximately $188 million of decommissioning funds at the closing of the acquisition which is included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds on FPL Groups condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. FPL Energy expects to file for a license extension for the plant in 2009, which, if approved, will e nable the plant to continue to operate for an additional 20 years beyond its current license expiration of 2014. In December 2006, FPL Energy entered into an agreement to purchase Point Beach, a two unit, 1,033 mw nuclear power plant located in Wisconsin from Wisconsin Electric. Under the agreement, FPL Energy will purchase the plant, including nuclear fuel, inventory and other items, for a total of approximately $998 million. Under the agreement, FPL Energy will sell the output of Point Beach to Wisconsin Electric under a long term contract. The duration of the contract will be, at the option of Wisconsin Electric, either through the current license terms of 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2 or for a term of 16 or 17 years from the closing date for Units 1 and 2, respectively. FPL Energy will be responsible for management and operation of the plant, as well as for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility and expects to receive at least $360 million of decommissioning funds at closing. The transaction is subject to, among other things, the receipt of approval s from various federal and state regulatory agencies. FPL Energy expects to close the transaction in the third quarter of 2007. FPL Energy expects its future portfolio capacity growth to come primarily from wind development and from asset acquisitions. FPL Energy plans to add a total of at least 1,500 mw of new wind generation over the 2007 and 2008 period, including approximately 450 mw which are currently under construction. In 2006, the FERC approved a settlement agreement that established a new forward capacity market in the NEPOOL region. The parties to the settlement agreement include wholesale power generators in New England, including FPL Energy, and four of the six New England states. Under the settlement agreement, capacity payments to generators will be established competitively through an annual auction, the first of which will be conducted in the first quarter of 2008 to purchase capacity for the twelve months starting June 1, 2010. The settlement agreement also provides for a transition period starting December 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, during which capacity suppliers will receive fixed capacity payments, subject to penalties for forced outages during peak demand periods. The settlement agreement, as approved by the FERC, is expected to result in increased gross margins for FPL Energys assets in the NEPOOL region during the transition period. Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary by geographic region. Revenues from electricity sales in these markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other ancillary services. Some of the factors affecting success in these markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth and exposure to legal and regulatory changes. Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for FPL Energy. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets. FPL Energy seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio, by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants. The major markets in which FPL Energy operates have shown signs of continued improvement since 2004, such as improved sparks spreads and energy prices in ERCOT and NEPOOL. The combination of new wind projects, expected increase in contribution from merchant assets and asset acquisitions are expected to be the key drivers in supporting FPL Energys growth over the next few years. FPL Energys earnings are subject to variability due to, among other things, operational performance, commodity price exposure, counterparty performance, weather conditions and project restructuring activities. FPL Energys exposure to commodity price risk is reduced by the degree of contract coverage obtained for 2007 and 2008. If FPL Energys plants do not perform as expected, this high degree of hedging could result in FPL Energy being required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. FPL Energys results are affected by natural fluctuations in weather. In addition to the effect of temperature, which is reflected in commodity prices and demand, changes in weather affect production levels of the wind portfolio as well as the hydro units in Maine. In managing its exposure to commodity prices, FPL Energy is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations. FPL Energy actively manages the trade off between market risk and credit risk, as well as exposure with individual counterparties as a function of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of FPL Energys 2007 contracted revenues are with investment grade counterparties. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of interest expense, the operating results of FPL FiberNet and other business activities as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates interest charges to FPL Energy based on a deemed capital structure at FPL Energy of 50% debt for operating projects and 100% debt for projects under construction. Each subsidiarys income taxes are calculated based on the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be utilized on a separate return basis, but are utilized on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or detriments are recorded at Corporate and Other. The major components of Corporate & Other results, on an after tax basis, are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (millions) Interest expense $ (97 ) $ (90 ) $ (78 ) FPL FiberNet impairment charge (60 ) Merger costs (14 ) State tax benefits 36 25 30 Interest income on secured third party loan 12 6 Gains on sale and termination of leveraged lease agreements 6 Other 4 (3 ) 8 Net loss $ (131 ) $ (50 ) $ (34 ) Interest expense increased in 2006 reflecting higher debt balances and slightly higher rates while the increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher rates. The impairment charge is for FPL FiberNets metro market assets. See Note 5 Corporate and Other. The merger costs represent costs associated with the proposed merger between FPL Group and Constellation Energy, which was terminated in October 2006. See Note 2. The state tax benefits are primarily due to FPL Energys growth throughout the United States and, in 2004, include the resolution of other tax issues. In 2006, state tax benefits were partially offset by a $7 million deferred tax expense resulting from a modification of the Texas franchise tax enacted in 2006. Interest income on a secured third party loan reflects the repayment of the loan in the fourth quarter of 2005. The 2005 gains on sale and termination of leveraged lease agreements ($10 million on a pretax basis) are included in gains (losses) on disposal of assets in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. Other includes all other corporate income and expenses as well as other business activities. The decline in 2005 reflects the absence of a pension transition credit that was fully amortized in 2004. Corporate and Others operating revenues increased in 2006 primarily due to the transfer, effective January 1, 2006, of FPLs retail gas business to a subsidiary of FPL Group Capital. The increase in operating expenses in 2006 is primarily due to the $98 million pretax impairment charge at FPL FiberNet as well as the transfer of FPLs retail gas business. Liquidity and Capital Resources FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for working capital, capital expenditures and investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, to pay maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, to redeem outstanding debt and or repurchase common stock. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated funds and the issuance, from time to time, of debt and equity securities, consistent with FPL Groups and FPLs objective of maintaining, on a long term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. Credit ratings can affect FPL Groups, FPLs and FPL Group Capitals ability to obtain short and long term financing, the cost of such financing and the execution of their respective financing strategies. Cash Flow The changes in cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows: FPL Group FPL Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,498 $ 1,547 $ 2,650 $ 1,668 $ 1,238 $ 1,948 Net cash used in investing activities (3,807 ) (2,165 ) (1,872 ) (1,933 ) (1,816 ) (1,400 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,399 923 (682 ) 273 569 (487 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 90 $ 305 $ 96 $ 8 $ (9 ) $ 61 FPL Groups cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006 benefited from net issuances of debt, the issuance of common stock and the recovery from customers of previously incurred fuel and storm costs at FPL, which were offset by an increase in FPLs customer receivables and the return of margin cash deposits and payment of cash collateral to counterparties. The funds generated were used to pay for capital expenditures at FPL, additional investments at FPL Energy, common stock dividends, storm related costs at FPL and to carry an increase in fossil fuel inventory. FPL Groups cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the recovery by FPL of fuel and storm costs deferred in prior years as a result of an increase in the fuel clause recovery factor effective January 2006 and the implementation of a storm damage surcharge applied to retail customer bills that began in February 2005. The recovery of these deferred costs was offset by storm related payments at FPL, an increase in customer receivables at FPL reflecting the higher fuel factor, the return of margin cash deposits and payment of cash collateral to counterparties due to changing energy prices and an increase in fossil fuel inventory. The increase in fossil fuel inventory is primarily due to the accumulation of oil inventory at FPL reflecting the burning of more natural gas due to relatively lower natural gas prices and the addition, at an FPL Energy plant, of oil and gas inventory which was purchased in connection with the termination of a fuel management contract. FPL Groups cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect capital investments of approximately $1,763 million by FPL to meet customer demand and costs associated with its Storm Secure Plan and independent power investments at FPL Energy of approximately $1,701 million, including the purchase of Duane Arnold. FPL Groups cash flows from investing activities also include amounts related to the purchase and sale of restricted securities held in the nuclear decommissioning funds including the reinvestment of fund earnings and new contributions from FPL Energy, as well as other investment activity. FPL suspended nuclear decommissioning fund contributions of approximately $79 million annually, beginning in September 2005, pursuant to the terms of the 2005 rate agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2006, FPL Group generated proceeds of approximately $3.8 billion from financing activities, including the issuance of $700 million in FPL first mortgage bonds, the borrowing of $250 million by FPL under a five year term loan facility, the borrowing of $400 million by FPL Group Capital under three separate two year term loan facilities, the issuance of $600 million in debentures and $700 million in enhanced junior subordinated debentures by FPL Group Capital, the issuance of $206 million of limited recourse senior secured notes and the borrowing of $600 million under a variable rate limited recourse term loan by FPL Energy subsidiaries, approximately $296 million from the issuance of FPL Group common stock related to its 8% Corporate Units and approximately $37 million related to the exercise of stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2006, FPL Group paid out approximately $2.4 billion for financing activities, inclu ding approximately $1.1 billion for maturing FPL Group Capital debentures, approximately $250 million for the repayment of FPL Group Capital variable rate term loans, approximately $135 million for maturing senior secured notes of a consolidated VIE that leases nuclear fuel to FPL, a net decrease in short term debt of approximately $62 million ($529 million decrease at FPL), approximately $48 million net to cancel approximately 4.2 million of FPL Groups 8% Corporate Units, approximately $593 million for the payment of dividends on its common stock and approximately $180 million for principal payments on FPL Energy debt. In January 2007, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Energy entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of 5.39% on approximately $547 million of its variable rate limited recourse debt in order to limit cash flow exposure. FPL Groups cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflect the benefit of net issuances of debt, the issuance of common stock, the receipt of payment of a secured third party loan, the receipt of cash collateral primarily from FPLs counterparties related to energy contracts (margin cash deposits) and the recovery from customers of a portion of the 2004 storm restoration costs at FPL. The funds generated were used to pay for common stock dividends, capital expenditures at FPL, additional investments at FPL Energy, FPL storm restoration costs and to fund under recovered fuel costs at FPL caused primarily by higher than anticipated fuel costs. FPL Groups cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect the use of funds to reduce debt, pay common stock dividends, make a secured loan and capital investments at FPL and FPL Energy, and pay for FPL storm restoration costs, as well as the benefit of the issuance of common stock and the sale of a note receivable by an indirect subsidiary of FPL Group. The following provides various metrics regarding FPL Groups (including FPLs) and FPLs outstanding debt: FPL Group FPL December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 2006 2005 Weighted average annual interest rate (a) 6.1 % 5.9 % 5.4 % 5.2 % Weighted average life (years) 13.1 9.3 17.9 15.1 Annual average of floating rate debt to total debt (a) 31 % 35 % 33 % 40 % (a) Calculations include the effects of interest rate swaps. Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures FPL Groups commitments were as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (millions) Long term debt, including interest: (a) FPL $ 227 $ 662 $ 419 $ 188 $ 188 $ 7,320 $ 9,004 FPL Energy 764 659 318 305 281 1,843 4,170 Corporate and Other 1,281 810 745 97 697 4,077 7,707 Purchase obligations: FPL (b) 4,915 3,760 3,050 2,810 2,565 6,335 23,435 FPL Energy (c) 2,401 845 61 60 59 878 4,304 Corporate and Other 15 15 Asset retirement activities: (d) FPL (e) 11,571 11,571 FPL Energy (f) 1 4,761 4,762 Total $ 9,603 $ 6,737 $ 4,593 $ 3,460 $ 3,790 $ 36,785 $ 64,968 (a) Includes principal, interest and interest rate swaps. Variable rate interest was computed using December 31, 2006 rates. (b) Represents required capacity and minimum payments under long term purchased power and fuel contracts, the majority of which are recoverable through various cost recovery clauses (see Note 16 Contracts), and projected capital expenditures through 2011 to meet, among other things, increased electricity usage and customer growth, capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities and estimated capital costs associated with FPLs Storm Secure Plan. Estimated capital costs associated with FPLs Storm Secure Plan are subject to change over time based on, among other things, productivity enhancements and prioritization. Excludes capital expenditures of approximately $3.4 billion (approximately $310 million in 2008) for the two ultra super critical pulverized coal generating units for the period from early 2008 (expected Siting Board approval) through 2011. See Note 16 Commitments. (c) Represents firm commitments primarily in connection with the purchase of wind turbines and towers, natural gas transportation, purchase and storage, firm transmission service, nuclear fuel for Seabrook and Duane Arnold and a portion of its projected capital expenditures, including, in 2007, the pending acquisition of Point Beach. See Note 16 Commitments and Contracts. (d) Represents expected cash payments adjusted for inflation for estimated costs to perform asset retirement activities. (e) At December 31, 2006, FPL had approximately $2,264 million in restricted trust funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPLs nuclear units, which are included in FPL Groups and FPLs nuclear decommissioning reserve funds. (f) At December 31, 2006, FPL Energys 88.23% portion of Seabrooks and 70% portion of Duane Arnolds restricted trust funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission Seabrook and Duane Arnold totaled approximately $560 million and are included in FPL Groups nuclear decommissioning reserve funds. Guarantees and Letters of Credit FPL Group and FPL obtain letters of credit and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. At December 31, 2006, FPL Group had standby letters of credit of approximately $733 million ($171 million for FPL) and approximately $6,719 million notional amount of guarantees ($356 million for FPL), of which approximately $5,562 million ($497 million for FPL) have expirations within the next five years. An aggregate of approximately $345 million of the standby letters of credit at December 31, 2006 were issued under FPLs and FPL Group Capitals credit facilities. See Available Liquidity below. These letters of credit and guarantees support the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities, debt related reserves, nuclear activities and other contractual agreements. FPL Group and FPL believe it is unlikely that they would incur any liabilities associated with these l etters of credit and guarantees. At December 31, 2006, FPL Group and FPL did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit and guarantees. In addition, FPL Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group Capital, including most of its debt, including all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees, and FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of FPL Energy and its subsidiaries. See Note 16 Commitments. In addition to the above, FPL Energy has guaranteed certain performance obligations of a power plant owned by a wholly owned subsidiary as part of a power purchase agreement that expires in 2027. Under this agreement, the subsidiary could incur market based liquidated damages for failure to meet contractual minimum outputs. In addition, certain subsidiaries of FPL Energy have contracts that require certain projects to meet annual minimum generation amounts. Failure to meet the annual minimum generation amounts would result in the FPL Energy subsidiary becoming liable for specified liquidated damages. Based on past performance of these and similar projects and current forward prices, management believes that the exposure associated with these guarantees is not material. Available Liquidity At December 31, 2006, FPL Groups total available net liquidity was approximately $4.8 billion and FPLs was approximately $1.9 billion. The components of each companys net available liquidity at December 31, 2006 were as follows. Maturity Date FPL FPL Group Capital FPL Group FPL FPL Group Capital (in millions) Bank revolving lines of credit (a) $ 2,000 (b) $ 2,500 $ 4,500 (b) November 2010 November 2010 Less letters of credit 156 189 345 1,844 2,311 4,155 Revolving term loan facility 250 250 May 2011 Less borrowings 250 250 May 2008 Cash and cash equivalents 64 556 620 Net available liquidity $ 1,908 $ 2,867 $ 4,775 (a) Provide for the issuance of letters of credit up to $4.5 billion and are available to support the companies commercial paper programs and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies or their subsidiaries operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss), as well as for general corporate purposes. (b) Excludes $300 million in senior secured revolving credit facilities of an entity consolidated by FPL under FIN 46(R) (the VIE) that leases nuclear fuel to FPL which credit facilities are available only to the VIE. FPL Group (which guarantees the payment of FPL Group Capitals credit facilities pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement) is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to total capitalization under the terms of FPL Group Capitals credit facility. FPL is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to total capitalization under the terms of FPLs credit facility. At December 31, 2006, each of FPL Group and FPL was in compliance with its respective ratio. In addition to the amounts in the table above, FPL Group Capital and FPL have each established an uncommitted credit facility with a bank to be used for general corporate purposes. The bank may at its discretion, upon the request of FPL Group Capital or FPL, make a short term loan or loans to FPL Group Capital or FPL in an aggregate amount determined by the bank, which is subject to change at any time. The terms of the specific borrowings under the uncommitted credit facilities, including maturity, are set at the time borrowing requests are made by FPL Group Capital or FPL. At December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding for either FPL Group Capital or FPL under the uncommitted credit facilities. During 2006, FPL entered into a $250 million revolving five year term loan facility, which is included in the table above, and FPL Group Capital entered into three separate two year term loan facilities aggregating $400 million, each of which expire in June 2008. Both FPL and FPL Group Capital borrowed the full amount under the term loan facilities during the second quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, FPL Group Capital repaid two of the three loans totaling $250 million. Under the terms of the respective term loan facilities, each of FPL and FPL Group is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to total capitalization. At December 31, 2006, each of FPL and FPL Group was in compliance with its respective ratio. Pursuant to its guarantee agreement with FPL Group Capital, FPL Group guarantees the payment of FPL Group Capitals term loans. In addition to the bank lines of credit discussed above, the consolidated VIE that leases nuclear fuel to FPL has established a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which expires in June 2009, and a $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2007. Both credit facilities provide backup support for the VIEs commercial paper program. FPL has provided an unconditional guarantee of the payment obligations of the VIE under the credit facilities, which is included in the guarantee discussion under Guarantees and Letters of Credit above. At December 31, 2006, the VIE had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and had approximately $221 million of commercial paper outstanding. Additionally, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Energy has established a $100 million letter of credit facility, which expires in 2017 and serves as security for certain obligations under commodity hedge agreements entered into by the subsidiary. Shelf Registration In September 2006, FPL Group, FPL Group Capital, FPL and certain affiliated trusts filed a shelf registration statement for an unspecified amount of securities with the SEC. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective board of directors. As of February 26, 2007, securities that may be issued under the registration statement, which became effective upon filing, include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, first mortgage bonds, preferred trust securities and guarantees related to certain of those securities. As of February 26, 2007, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital had $2 billion (issuable by either or both of them up to such aggregate amount) of board authorized available capacity, and FPL had $1 billion of board authorized available capacity. Covenants FPL Groups charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of FPL Group to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. During the first quarter of 2006, FPL Group increased its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.355 to $0.375 per share. In February 2007, FPL Group announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.375 to $0.41 per share. FPL pays dividends to FPL Group in a manner consistent with FPLs long term targeted capital structure. FPLs mortgage contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to FPL Group and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. In light of FPLs current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends woul d be affected by these limitations. Under the mortgage securing FPLs first mortgage bonds, in some cases, the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock is restricted. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPLs use of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2006, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage. FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPLs first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior FPL indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 would have been approximately 11 times the annual interest requirements and approximately six times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. As of December 31, 2006, FPL could have issued in excess of $6.0 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.5 billion based on retired first mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2006, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes. In September 2006, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a replacement capital covenant (RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capitals offering of $350 million principal amount of Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 and $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (collectively, enhanced junior subordinated debentures). The RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long term indebtedness (covered debt) of FPL Group Capital (other than the enhanced junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the RCC. The RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem, and FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any enhanced junior subordinated debentures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price exce eds a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitations described in the RCC. Qualifying securities are securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the enhanced junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 180 days prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the enhanced junior subordinated debentures. Credit Ratings Securities of FPL Group and its subsidiaries are currently rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). At February 26, 2007, Moodys, S&P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital: Moodys (a) S&P (a) Fitch (a) FPL Group: (b) Corporate credit rating A2 A A FPL: (b) Corporate credit rating A1 A A First mortgage bonds Aa3 A AA Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds Aa3/VMIG 1 A A+ Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F 1 FPL Group Capital: (b) Corporate credit rating N/A A A Debentures A2 A A Junior subordinated debentures A3 BBB+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F 1 (a) A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. (b) The outlook indicated by each of Moodys, S&P and Fitch is stable. FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of debt outstanding. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities maintained by FPL Group Capital and FPL, the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating is not a condition to drawing upon those credit facilities. However, commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when ratings change. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities, and could result in the requirement that FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, post collateral under certain power purchase and other agreements. FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, may be req uired to post collateral in excess of collateral threshold amounts when FPL Groups exposure to the counterparty under the applicable trading agreement exceeds such threshold. Other FPL was impacted by four hurricanes in 2005 and three hurricanes in 2004, which caused major damage in parts of FPLs service territory. Storm restoration costs incurred by FPL during 2005 and 2004 exceeded the amount in the storm and property insurance reserve. At December 31, 2006, FPLs storm reserve deficiency totaled approximately $868 million. In May 2006, the FPSC approved the issuance of up to $708 million of bonds pursuant to the securitization provisions of Section 366.8260 of the Florida Statutes for the net of tax recovery by FPL of the estimated storm reserve deficiency, including interest, and for a storm and property insurance reserve of $200 million. The unrecovered 2004 storm restoration costs are being recovered through a previously approved storm damage surcharge applied to retail customer bills since February 2005. Once the bonds are issued, a surcharge to retail customers will be used for repayment of the outstanding b onds. FPL is working with the FPSC staff and its financial advisors to complete the issuance of the bonds. See Note 1 Storm Reserve Deficiency. In January 2006, FPL introduced an initiative to enhance its electrical grid as a result of heightened hurricane activity and in response to concerns express by the community, state leaders and regulators. The estimated capital expenditures associated with this initiative, as well as the FPSCs approved storm preparedness plan (collectively, Storm Secure Plan) for 2007 through 2011 are included in FPLs projected capital expenditures under Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures above, and are subject to change over time based on, among other things, productivity enhancements and prioritization. See Note 16 Commitments. See also Results of Operations FPL for further discussion regarding the impact of Storm Secure Plan costs on O&M expenses. In February 2005, FPL Groups board of directors approved a two for one stock split of FPL Groups common stock effective March 15, 2005 (2005 stock split). FPL Groups authorized common stock increased from 400 million to 800 million shares. Also in February 2005, FPL Groups board of directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan of up to 20 million shares of common stock (after giving effect to the 2005 stock split) over an unspecified period, which plan was ratified and confirmed by the board of directors in December 2005, and terminated a previous common stock repurchase plan. At December 31, 2006, no shares had been repurchased under the repurchase plan. In June 2005, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Group completed the acquisition of Gexa Corp., a retail electric provider in Texas. Each share of Gexa Corp.s outstanding common stock was converted into 0.1682 of a share of FPL Group common stock. Assuming the exercise of Gexa Corp.s options and warrants net of cash to be received upon exercise, the aggregate value of the consideration for the acquisition of Gexa Corp. was approximately $73 million, payable in shares of FPL Group common stock. New Accounting Rules and Interpretations Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." See Note 6. Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities In September 2006, the FASB issued FSP AUG AIR 1, "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities." See Note 1 Major Maintenance Costs. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements." See Note 1 Fair Value Measurements. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." See Note 3. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." See Note 1 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions where amounts are not subject to precise measurement or are dependent on future events. Critical accounting policies and estimates, which are important to the portrayal of both FPL Groups and FPLs financial condition and results of operations and which require complex, subjective judgments are as follows: Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities FPL Group and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate risk associated with long term debt. In addition, FPL Group uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets. Accounting pronouncements, which require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, apply not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market under FAS 133, as amended, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and fuel. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. In general, the models estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. The near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contract. Substantially all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by FPL are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel and capacity clauses. In FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, changes in derivative fair values are recognized in current earnings, unless the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge. For those transactions accounted for as c ash flow hedges, much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of common shareholders equity, rather than being recognized in current earnings. For those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges, the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged. Since FAS 133 became effective in 2001, the FASB has discussed and from time to time issued implementation guidance related to FAS 133. In particular, much of the interpretive guidance affects when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from the provisions of FAS 133. Despite the large volume of implementation guidance, FAS 133 and the supplemental guidance does not provide specific guidance on all contract issues. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying FAS 133 and its interpretations. The interpretation of FAS 133 continues to evolve. A result of changes in interpretation could be that contracts that currently are excluded from the provisions of FAS 133 would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. Certain economic hedging transactions at FPL Energy do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the income statement, often resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings. This could be significant to FPL Energys results because often the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market (such as the physical assets from which power is generated) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. Because of this, FPL Groups management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instrument s, see Note 4 and also see Managements Discussion Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits FPL Group sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries. FPL Group also has a supplemental executive retirement plan which includes a non qualified supplemental defined pension benefit component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees. In addition to pension benefits, FPL Group sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits (other benefits plan) for retirees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan. The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance. FPL Gro up allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria. Effective December 31, 2006, FPL Group adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, which requires the reporting of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations on the balance sheet as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. Since FPL Group is the plan sponsor, and the subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, the results of implementing the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158 are reflected at FPL Group and not allocated to its subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods is classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at FPL Group in accordance with regulatory treatment as required by FAS 71, "Accounting for the Ef fects of Certain Types of Regulation." FAS 158 also requires FPL Group to measure plan assets and liabilities as of its year end, rather than as of September 30, no later than December 31, 2008. FPL Groups pension income net of the cost of the other benefits plan was approximately $65 million, $52 million and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The corresponding amounts allocated to FPL were $52 million, $39 million and $62 million, respectively. Pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all years, assumed increases in future compensation levels of 4.0% for all years, and a weighted average discount rate of 5.50% for all years. Based on current health care costs (as related to other benefits), the projected 2007 trend assumption used to measure the expected cost of health care benefits covered by the plans for all age groups are 8.0% for medical benefits and 10.0% for prescription drug benefits. &n bsp;These rates are assumed to decrease over the next ten years to the ultimate trend rate of 5.0% and remain at that level thereafter. The ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in 2013 for medical costs and 2017 for prescription drug costs. In developing these assumptions, FPL Group evaluated input from its actuaries, as well as information available in the marketplace. For the expected long term rate of return on fund assets, FPL Group considered 10 year and 20 year historical median returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds. FPL Group also considered its funds historical compounded returns. FPL Group believes that 7.75% is a reasonable long term rate of return on its plans assets. FPL Group will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as necessary. FPL Group bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits plan expense and income only when they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would have reduced FPL Groups net income for 2006 by approximately $14 million ($11 million for FPL). Lowering the discount rate assumption by 0.5% would have decreased FPL Groups net income for 2006 by approximately $5 million ($4 million for FPL). Raising the salary increase assumption by 0.5% would have decreased FPL Groups net income for 2006 by approximately $2 million ($2 million for FPL). Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits. However, this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in FPL Groups other benefits plan. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1% would have reduced FPL Groups net income for 2006 by approximately $1 million. The fair value of plan assets has increased from $3.1 billion at September 30, 2005 to $3.2 billion at September 30, 2006 for the pension plan and decreased from $49 million at September 30, 2005 to $48 million at September 30, 2006 for the other benefits plan. Management believes that, based on the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, FPL Group will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. In December 2006, $26 million was transferred from the qualified pension plan as reimbursement for eligible retiree medical expenses paid by FPL Group during the year pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. FPL Group anticipates paying approximately $29 million for eligible retiree medical expenses on behalf of the other benefits plan during 2007 with substantially all of that amount being reimbursed through a transfer of assets from the qualified pension plan pursuant to the provision s of the Internal Revenue Code. See Note 3. Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets FPL Group evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable as described in FAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Under that standard, an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the assets fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized. In 2006, FPL FiberNet performed an impairment analysis and concluded that an impairment charge related to its metro market assets was necessary. The critical assumptions and estimates used in the analysis include revenue additions, projected capital expenditures and a discount rate. A 10% increase in the revenue growth rate or a 10% decrease in projected capital expenditures would have resulted in no impairment, while a 10% decrease in the revenue growth rate or a 10% increase in projected capital expenditures would increase the impairment charge by less than $5 million. An increase or decrease of 1% in the discount rate would have a corresponding change to the impairment charge of approximately $3 million. See Note 5 Corporate and Other. Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil Dismantlement FPL Group and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations under FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations." FAS 143 and FIN 47 require that a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation (ARO) be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets. See Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 15. For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the FPSC at least every five years. The most recent studies, filed in 2005, indicate that FPLs portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage, is $10.9 billion, or $2.1 billion in 2006 dollars. The studies reflect, among other things, the 20 year license extensions of FPLs nuclear units and support the suspension, effective September 2005, of the $79 million annual decommissioning accrual. At December 31, 2006, $2,541 million was accrued for nuclear decommissioning, of which $1,540 million was recorded as an ARO, $55 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $864 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $192 million was included in accrued asset removal costs (a regulatory liability) on the consolidated balance sheets. FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC at least every four years. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, fossil dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies, which became effective January 1, 2003, indicated that FPLs portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil units is $668 million. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered AROs. At December 31, 2006, $308 million was accrued for fossil dismantlement costs, of which $30 million was recorded as an ARO, $5 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $4 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $279 million was included in accrued asset removal costs (a regulatory liability) on the consolidated balance sheets. FPL Energy records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs in accordance with FAS 143 and FIN 47. The nuclear decommissioning liability represents the fair value of FPL Energys ultimate decommissioning liability for Seabrook and Duane Arnold. The fair value of the ultimate decommissioning liability as of December 31, 2006 was determined using various internal and external data. FPL Energys portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning Seabrook and Duane Arnold, including costs associated with spent fuel storage, is approximately $4.3 billion, or $725 million expressed in 2006 dollars. The liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At December 31, 2006, the ARO for Seabrooks and Duane Arnolds nuclear decommissioning totaled approximately $213 million. The calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation under FAS 143 and FIN 47. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, FPL Group and FPL also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, FPL Group and FPL will be required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed es calation rates would increase FPL Groups and FPLs ARO as of December 31, 2006 by $180 million and $158 million, respectively. Regulatory Accounting FPL follows the accounting practices set forth in FAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." FAS 71 indicates that regulators can create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. If FPL were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of FAS 71 is assessed at each reporting period. Effective December 31, 2006, FPL Group adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, which requires reporting of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations related to pension and other post retirement benefits gross on the balance sheet. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods is classified as regulatory assets and liabilities on FPL Groups 2006 consolidated balance sheet in accordance with regulatory treatment as required by FAS 71. See Note 3. FPL Groups and FPLs regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows: FPL Group FPL December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 2006 2005 Regulatory assets: (millions) Current: Deferred clause and franchise expenses $ 167 $ 795 $ 167 $ 795 Storm reserve deficiency $ 106 $ 156 $ 106 $ 156 Derivatives $ 921 $ $ 921 $ Other $ 3 $ 7 $ $ 7 Noncurrent: Storm reserve deficiency $ 762 $ 957 $ 762 $ 957 Deferred clause expenses $ $ 307 $ $ 307 Unamortized loss on reacquired debt $ 39 $ 42 $ 39 $ 42 Other $ 80 $ 37 $ 37 $ 37 Regulatory liabilities: Current: Deferred clause and franchise revenues $ 37 $ 32 $ 37 $ 32 Derivatives $ $ 757 $ $ 757 Pension $ 17 $ $ $ Noncurrent: Accrued asset removal costs $ 2,044 $ 2,033 $ 2,044 $ 2,033 Asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference $ 868 $ 786 $ 868 $ 786 Pension $ 531 $ $ $ Other $ 209 $ 256 $ 209 $ 256 See Note 1 for a discussion of FPL Groups and FPLs other significant accounting policies. Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity Energy Marketing and Trading Certain of FPL Groups subsidiaries, including FPL and FPL Energy, use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as to optimize the value of power generation assets. FPL Energy provides full energy and capacity requirements services to distribution utilities in certain markets and engages in energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market under FAS 133, as amended, are recorded on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. For FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, essentially all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases and sales are recognized net in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income unless hedge accounting is applied. See Note 4. The changes in the fair value of FPL Groups consolidated subsidiaries energy contract derivative instruments were as follows: Hedges on Owned Assets Trading Non Qualifying OCI FPL Cost Recovery Clauses FPL Group Total (millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004 $ 4 $ (10 ) $ (109 ) $ (9 ) $ (124 ) Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (3 ) (9 ) 89 (617 ) (540 ) Acquisition of Gexa contracts 38 38 Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI (353 ) (353 ) Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings (33 ) (33 ) Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 1 (162 ) 1,383 1,222 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005 2 (176 ) (373 ) 757 210 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts 26 107 56 325 514 Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI 261 261 Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings 31 31 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized (23 ) 46 (2,003 ) (1,980 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 5 8 (56 ) (921 ) (964 ) Net option premium payments (receipts) (1 ) 16 145 160 Total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2006 $ 4 $ 24 $ (56 ) $ (776 ) $ (804 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2006 shown above are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows: December 31, 2006 (millions) Derivative assets $ 371 Other assets 73 Other current liabilities (1,141 ) Other liabilities (107 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) $ (804 ) The sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Maturity 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (millions) Trading: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices $ 11 $ 7 $ $ $ $ $ 18 Prices provided by other external sources (162 ) (8 ) 1 1 (168 ) Modeled 152 3 155 Total 1 2 1 1 5 Owned Assets Non Qualifying: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices (211 ) (20 ) 2 (10 ) (7 ) (5 ) (251 ) Prices provided by other external sources 230 9 (3 ) (2 ) (2 ) 232 Modeled 29 (1 ) (1 ) 27 Total 48 (11 ) (1 ) (12 ) (8 ) (8 ) 8 Owned Assets OCI: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices (1 ) (1 ) Prices provided by other external sources (30 ) (26 ) 1 7 3 (45 ) Modeled (5 ) (5 ) (10 ) Total (36 ) (31 ) 1 7 3 (56 ) Owned Assets FPL Cost Recovery Clauses: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices (727 ) (727 ) Prices provided by other external sources (195 ) (195 ) Modeled 2 (1 ) 1 Total (920 ) (1 ) (921 ) Total sources of fair value $ (907 ) $ (41 ) $ 1 $ (5 ) $ (5 ) $ (7 ) $ (964 ) Market Risk Sensitivity Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of FPL Group and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks. With respect to commodities, FPL Groups Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, is responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. FPL Group and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. FPL Group manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees. Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. FPL Groups credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. Commodity price risk FPL Group uses a value at risk (VaR) model to measure market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the VaR figures are as follows: Trading Non Qualifying Hedges and Hedges in OCI and FPL Cost Recovery Clauses (a) Total FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group (millions) December 31, 2005 $ $ 1 $ 1 $ 114 $ 38 $ 98 $ 114 $ 39 $ 98 December 31, 2006 $ $ 2 $ 2 $ 89 $ 57 $ 54 $ 89 $ 60 $ 56 Average for the period ended December 31, 2006 $ $ 2 $ 2 $ 113 $ 47 $ 88 $ 113 $ 48 $ 88 (a) Non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI and FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements. Interest rate risk FPL Group and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt, investments in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds and interest rate swaps. FPL Group and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate swaps and adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. The following are estimates of the fair value of FPL Groups and FPLs financial instruments: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value FPL Group: (millions) Long term debt, including current maturities $ 11,236 $ 11,314 (a) $ 9,443 $ 9,540 (a) Fixed income securities: Nuclear decommissioning reserve funds $ 1,430 $ 1,430 (b) $ 1,290 $ 1,290 (b) Other investments $ 93 $ 93 (b) $ 80 $ 80 (b) Interest rate swaps net unrealized gain (loss) $ 6 $ 6 (c) $ (9 ) $ (9 )(c) FPL: Long term debt, including current maturities $ 4,214 $ 4,208 (a) $ 3,406 $ 3,416 (a) Fixed income securities: Nuclear decommissioning reserve funds $ 1,235 $ 1,235 (b) $ 1,151 $ 1,151 (b) (a) Based on market prices provided by external sources. (b) Based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues. (c) Based on market prices modeled internally. The nuclear decommissioning reserve funds of FPL Group consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of decommissioning of FPL Groups and FPLs nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value. At FPL, adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The market value adjustments of FPL Groups non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI. See Note 10. FPL Group and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to adjust and mitigate interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements. At December 31, 2006, the estimated fair value for FPL Group interest rate swaps was as follows: Notional Amount Effective Date Maturity Date Rate Paid Rate Received Estimated Fair Value (millions) (millions) Fair value hedges FPL Group Capital: $ 300 November 2004 February 2007 variable (a) 4.086 % $ (2 ) $ 275 December 2004 February 2007 variable (b) 4.086 % (2 ) Total fair value hedges (4 ) Cash flow hedges FPL Energy: $ 87 August 2002 December 2007 4.410 % variable (c) 1 $ 172 August 2003 November 2007 3.557 % variable (c) 2 $ 5 February 2005 June 2008 4.255 % variable (c) 1 $ 78 December 2003 December 2017 4.245 % variable (c) 3 $ 26 April 2004 December 2017 3.845 % variable (c) 1 $ 234 December 2005 November 2019 4.905 % variable (c) 2 Total cash flow hedges 10 Total interest rate hedges $ 6 (a) Three month LIBOR plus 0.50577% (b) Three month LIBOR plus 0.4025% (c) Three month LIBOR Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near term market change, the net fair value of FPL Groups net liabilities would increase by approximately $390 million ($200 million for FPL) at December 31, 2006. Equity price risk Included in the nuclear decommissioning reserve funds of FPL Group are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $1,395 million and $1,113 million ($1,029 million and $933 million for FPL) at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near term market change, would result in a $139 million ($103 million for FPL) reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL, or adjustments to OCI for FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, at December 31, 2006. Credit risk For all derivative and contractual transactions, FPL Groups energy marketing and trading operations, which includes FPLs energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Relevant considerations when assessing FPL Groups energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include: Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry. Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the United States. Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of cash collateral. The use of master netting agreements to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. FPL Groups policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties. Based on FPL Groups policies and risk exposures related to credit, FPL Group and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial positions as a result of counterparty nonperformance. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 97% of FPL Groups and 100% of FPLs energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.
