Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. In the discussion of Results of Operations below, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. Overview FPL Group is one of the nations largest providers of electricity related services. It has two principal operating subsidiaries, FPL and FPL Energy. FPL serves more than 8.7 million people throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida. FPL Energy, FPL Groups competitive energy subsidiary, produces electricity primarily utilizing natural gas, wind and nuclear resources. Together, FPLs and FPL Energys generating assets represented approximately 37,700 mw of capacity at December 31, 2007. FPL FiberNet provides fiber optic services to FPL, telecommunications companies and other customers throughout Florida. 26 FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the retail sale of electricity. FPL expects the 2005 rate agreement to be in effect through December 31, 2009. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates. Over the last ten years, FPLs average annual customer growth has been 2.2% while usage growth per customer has been 0.6%. FPL has observed a decline in non weather related usage per customer and, in the latter part of 2007, began to experience a slowdown in customer growth in its service territory. FPL suspects that weakness in the housing markets in both Florida and the rest of the United States has contributed to a slowdown in customer growth and, to a lesser extent, may have also contributed to the decline in non weather related usage per customer. FPLs business strategy is to continue meeting the increased demands of customers in a safe, reliable, cost effective manner while focusing on operating performance. FPL Energy is in the competitive energy business with the majority of its operating revenues derived from wholesale electricity sales. Its business strategy is to maximize the value of its current portfolio, expand its U.S. market leading wind position and build its portfolio through asset acquisitions. FPL Energy plans to add a total of 8,000 mw to 10,000 mw of new wind generation over the 2007 2012 period, of which 1,064 mw were added in 2007 and at least 1,100 mw are expected to be added in 2008. In addition, FPL Energy intends to pursue opportunities for new solar generating facilities. The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other things, continued public policy support. FPL Energys market is diversified by region as well as by fuel source. FPL Energy sells a large percentage of its expected output to hedge against price volatility. Therefore, if FPL Energys plants do not perform as expected, FPL Energy could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. FPL Energys energy marketing and trading business is focused on managing commodity price risk and extracting maximum value from its assets. FPL Group and its subsidiaries segregate unrealized mark to market gains and losses on derivative transactions into two categories. The first category, referred to as trading activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts. The second category, referred to as non qualifying hedges, represents the net unrealized effect of derivative transactions entered into as economic hedges (but which do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended) and the ineffective portion of transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges. FPL Group uses derivative instruments to manage its commodity price and interest rate risk. FPL Groups management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings), which in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges and, in 2006 also included merger related costs, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as inputs in determining whether performance targets are met for performance based compensation under FPL Groups employee incentive compensation plans. FPL Group also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its earnings outlook to investors. FPL Groups management believes adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations dif ficult and potentially confusing. FPL Group and FPL adopted FSP FIN 39 1 effective December 31, 2007, which amended certain provisions of FIN 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts," and required the offsetting of amounts recognized for the right to reclaim and obligation to return cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement when such offsetting derivative positions are presented on a net basis. FSP FIN 39 1 required retrospective application and, accordingly, all prior period consolidated balance sheets of FPL Group and FPL have been adjusted to reflect this change. See Note 4. Results of Operations Summary Presented below is a summary of net income (loss) by reportable segment (see Note 17): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (millions) FPL $ 836 $ 802 $ 748 FPL Energy 540 610 203 Corporate and Other (64 ) (131 ) (50 ) FPL Group Consolidated $ 1,312 $ 1,281 $ 901 27 FPLs 2007 improved results benefited from a retail base rate increase associated with Turkey Point Unit No. 5 and continued retail customer growth, partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation and amortization expenses recovered through base rates, a slight decline in retail customer usage and lower interest income on underrecovered fuel and storm costs. In addition, disallowed storm costs, net of certain interest, reduced 2006 net income by approximately $27 million. FPLs 2006 improved results reflect lower depreciation and amortization expense and customer growth partly offset by the expensing of disallowed 2005 storm costs, higher O&M expenses and a slight decline in usage per retail customer. FPL Energys 2007 results reflect additional earnings from the existing portfolio, from new investments and from full energy and capacity requirements services and trading. These benefits were partially offset by higher interest, general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the business. FPL Energys 2006 results reflect an approximately $97 million gain ($63 million after tax) resulting from a court judgment relating to an Indonesian project that was suspended in 1998, additional earnings from new investments and improved results from the existing portfolio. In addition, FPL Groups and FPL Energys net income for 2007 and 2005 reflect net unrealized after tax losses from non qualifying hedges of $86 million and $112 million, respectively, while 2006 net income reflects net unrealized after tax gains from such hedges of $92 million. The change in unrealized mark to market activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural ga s prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains/losses as the underlying transactions are realized. As a general rule, a gain (loss) in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under generally accepted accounting principles. Results for Corporate and Other in 2007 reflect lower interest costs and higher interest income, partly offset by lower federal and state tax benefits. In addition, results for Corporate and Other in 2006 reflect a $98 million ($60 million after tax) impairment charge related to FPL FiberNets metro market assets as a result of significant changes in the business climate in which FPL FiberNet operates. In addition, Corporate and Others 2006 results reflect approximately $14 million of after tax merger costs associated with the proposed merger between FPL Group and Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (Constellation Energy), which was terminated in October 2006. See Note 5 Corporate and Other for FPL FiberNet impairment charges and Note 17 for segment information. FPL Groups effective tax rate for all periods presented reflects PTCs for wind projects at FPL Energy. PTCs can significantly affect FPL Groups effective tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income and wind generation. See Note 1 Income Taxes, Note 6 and Note 11 Sale of Differential Membership Interests. FPL FPLs net income for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $836 million, $802 million and $748 million, respectively, an increase in 2007 of $34 million and an increase in 2006 of $54 million. FPLs 2007 results benefited from a retail base rate increase associated with Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation on May 1, 2007 and continued retail customer growth. These factors were partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation and amortization expenses recovered through base rates, a slight decline in usage per retail customer and lower interest income on underrecovered fuel and storm costs. In addition, disallowed storm costs, net of interest income recorded on 2005 storm restoration costs approved for recovery by the FPSC, reduced FPLs 2006 net income by approximately $27 million. In 2006, when considering FPLs petition to recover 2005 storm costs, the FPSC applied a different standard for recovery of 2005 costs than was used for recovery of the 2004 storm costs. This resulted in certain adjustments and disallowances of storm costs that FPL sought to recover. FPLs 2006 net income benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense, continued customer growth and certain federal income tax deductions and credits. These factors were partially offset by higher O&M and property tax expenses, the storm cost disallowance and a slight decline in usage per retail customer. FPLs current retail base rates were approved by the FPSC in 2005 and are effective through December 31, 2009. The 2005 rate agreement replaced the 2002 rate agreement which was in effect from April 15, 2002 through December 31, 2005. The 2005 rate agreement provides that retail base rates will not increase during the term of the agreement except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of any power plant approved pursuant to the Siting Act that achieves commercial operation during the term of the 2005 rate agreement. Retail base rates increased in 2007 when Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commenced commercial operation on May 1, 2007. The 2005 rate agreement also continues the revenue sharing mechanism in the 2002 rate agreement, whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of certain thresholds will be shared with customers on the basis of two thirds refunded to customers and one third retained by FPL. Revenues from retail base op erations in excess of a second, higher threshold (cap) will be refunded 100% to customers. The revenue sharing threshold and cap are adjusted each year. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenues from retail base operations did not exceed the thresholds for those years and FPL does not expect 2008 revenues to exceed the thresholds. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates for information on the calculation of the threshold and cap and for information on FPLs regulatory ROE. The 2005 rate agreement, among other things, requires FPL to use electric property depreciation rates based upon comprehensive depreciation studies filed with the FPSC in March 2005 and permits FPL to continue to reduce annual depreciation by up to $125 million, which FPL has been doing since 2002. The 2005 rate agreement suspended contributions of approximately $79 million per year to the nuclear decommissioning fund beginning in September 2005. The 2005 rate agreement also suspended, beginning in 2006, contributions of $20.3 million per year to the storm and property insurance reserve but allows FPL to recover prudently incurred storm restoration costs, either through securitization provisions pursuant to a state financing statute or surcharges. See Note 1 Securitization. 28 FPLs operating revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (millions) Retail base $ 3,796 $ 3,657 $ 3,658 Fuel cost recovery 6,162 6,573 4,283 Other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs 1,490 1,588 1,368 Other, primarily gas, transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees 174 170 219 Total $ 11,622 $ 11,988 $ 9,528 For the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase in the average number of customers of 2.0% increased retail base revenues by approximately $71 million. During this period, usage per retail customer decreased 0.4%. This usage decrease, as well as other factors, decreased retail base revenues by approximately $18 million. In addition, a base rate increase resulting from Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation on May 1, 2007 increased retail base revenues by approximately $86 million. Although the 2007 increase in the average number of customers was the same as the 2006 increase, the pattern of growth was considerably different. Much of the 2007 growth occurred early in the year and there was very little customer growth in the latter part of 2007. FPL suspects the weakness in the housing markets in both Florida and the rest of the United States has contributed to this slowdown in FPLs customer growth and, to a lesser extent, ma y have also contributed to a decline in non weather related usage per customer. For the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase in the average number of customers of 2.0% increased retail base revenues by approximately $74 million. During this period, usage per retail customer decreased 0.4% primarily due to warmer weather experienced in 2005 and the elasticity effect on customers of higher electricity prices in 2006 reflecting the increase in FPLs retail fuel clause recovery factor as discussed below. This decrease in usage per retail customer was partly offset by the absence of hurricane activity in 2006 compared to the 2005 activity that caused customer service interruptions throughout FPLs service territory. This usage decrease, as well as other factors, decreased retail base revenues by approximately $23 million. In addition, under the 2005 rate agreement, FPL was authorized by the FPSC to collect, through a separate charge on a customer bill, the portion (approximately 1.5%) of gross receipts taxes that was previously embedded in bas e rates. This resulted in an approximately $52 million reduction in retail base revenues with a corresponding increase in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs. Revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs, such as franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm related surcharges, do not significantly affect net income; however, underrecovery or overrecovery of such costs can significantly affect FPL Groups and FPLs operating cash flows. Fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, as well as by changes in energy sales. Fluctuations in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs are primarily driven by changes in storm related surcharges, capacity charges, franchise fee costs, the impact of changes in O&M and depreciation expenses on the underlying cost recovery clause, as well as changes in energy sales. Capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes, respectively, in the consoli dated statements of income. Ordinarily, the fuel charge is set annually based on estimated fuel costs and estimated customer usage, plus or minus a true up for prior period estimates. FPL utilizes a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the FPSC at the programs inception. The FPSC reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs. The program is intended to reduce the risk of unexpected fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. In response to higher fuel prices, as well as the recovery of a portion of underrecovered fuel costs from 2005, in January 2006 the retail fuel clause recovery factor was increased approximately 46%, which was the primary contributor to the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues in 2006. The retail fuel clause recovery factor for 2007 was reduced approximately 7.2% in January 2007 primarily in response to expected fue l price changes. This factor declined again by another 2.3% during the second quarter of 2007 when Turkey Point Unit No. 5 was placed in service, although a typical 1,000 kwh residential bill remained the same because the previously discussed base rate increase for this unit offset the fuel clause recovery factor decline. In May 2007, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL issued $652 million aggregate principal amount of storm recovery bonds primarily for the after tax equivalent of the total of FPLs unrecovered balance of the 2004 storm restoration costs, the 2005 storm restoration costs and approximately $200 million to reestablish FPLs storm and property insurance reserve. The storm recovery bonds, including interest and bond issuance costs, are being repaid through a surcharge to retail customers. Prior to the issuance of these storm recovery bonds, FPL had been recovering from retail customers since February 2005, the 2004 storm restoration costs through a storm damage surcharge. Both the revenues from the 2004 storm damage surcharge and the storm recovery bonds surcharge are included in other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs and amounted to approximately $94 million, $151 million and $155 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. &nbsp ;Revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs also declined in 2007 due to the absence in 2007 of the recovery of a portion of litigation costs that FPL had been recovering since 2002 through the capacity clause. See further discussion, see Note 1 Securitization and see discussion below of depreciation and amortization expense. 29 The decrease in other revenues in 2006 is primarily due to the transfer, effective January 1, 2006, of FPLs retail gas contracts to a subsidiary of FPL Group Capital, which also reduced FPLs fuel expense by approximately $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The major components of FPLs fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (millions) Fuel and energy charges during the period $ 6,259 $ 5,662 $ 5,213 Recovery of costs incurred in a prior period 91 743 140 Net over (under) recovery of costs during the period (142 ) 194 (1,027 ) Other, primarily capacity charges net of any capacity deferral 518 517 584 Total $ 6,726 $ 7,116 $ 4,910 The increase in fuel and energy charges in 2007 reflects higher fuel and energy prices of approximately $532 million and approximately $65 million attributable to higher energy sales. The increase in fuel and energy charges in 2006 reflects higher fuel and energy prices of approximately $415 million and approximately $98 million attributable to higher energy sales, partly offset by approximately $64 million related to the transfer of FPLs retail gas contracts. The recovery of costs incurred in a prior period represents the collection of underrecovered fuel costs the FPSC permitted FPL to start collecting at the beginning of the respective year. The net overrecovery (underrecovery) of costs during the period represents fuel clause collections from customers which were higher (lower) than fuel and energy costs incurred. FPLs O&M expenses increased $80 million in 2007 reflecting higher nuclear, fossil generation, distribution, customer service and employee benefits costs of approximately $23 million, $11 million, $11 million, $7 million and $17 million, respectively. The increase in nuclear costs reflects plant improvement initiatives at Turkey Point Unit Nos. 3 and 4 while the fossil generation increase reflects costs associated with placing Turkey Point Unit No. 5 in service as well as costs associated with plant repair and a performance payment made to an owner of a jointly owned plant. The distribution increase reflects higher Storm Secure costs partly offset by lower new service account costs reflecting a decline in housing starts in FPLs territory. The customer service increase reflects staffing increases related to customer growth and higher uncollectible accounts. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income. Management expects O&M expenses in 2008 to continue trending upward reflecting higher nuclear, fossil generation, customer service and employee benefit costs. FPLs O&M expenses increased $67 million in 2006 primarily due to higher transmission and distribution costs and costs associated with Storm Secure totaling approximately $39 million, higher employee benefit costs, primarily medical, of approximately $10 million and higher customer service costs of approximately $19 million reflecting additional staffing needs and higher uncollectible accounts as a result of higher customer bills. These factors were partially offset by the suspension in 2006 of approximately $20 million of contributions to the storm and property insurance reserve in accordance with the 2005 rate agreement. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $14 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2006 included approximately $45 million of amortization of litigation costs that FPL had been recovering through cost recovery clauses over a five year period that began January 1, 2002 and ended December 31, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 reflects higher depreciation on transmission and distribution facilities (approximately $25 million) to support customer growth and demand and depreciation on Turkey Point Unit No. 5 (approximately $18 million). The remaining change in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to lower depreciation on software that has been fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $164 million primarily benefiting from lower depreciation rates and the elimination of the decommissioning accrual approved as part of t he 2005 rate agreement (a collective benefit of approximately $242 million). This reduction in depreciation rates applied to substantially all power plant assets including Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 and St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2, which have received 20 year license extensions. This was partially offset by FPLs continued investment in transmission and distribution facilities to support customer growth and demand (approximately $31 million), depreciation from the addition of two new generating units at FPLs existing Martin and Manatee power plant sites which became operational on June 30, 2005 (approximately $23 million) and increased nuclear depreciation related to plant additions (approximately $24 million). Taxes other than income taxes decreased $13 million in 2007 but increased $187 million in 2006 primarily due to changes in franchise fees and revenue taxes, which are pass through costs. Franchise fees and revenue taxes vary as a result of fluctuations in fuel and other cost recovery clause revenues, which is discussed above under the operating revenue table. In addition, taxes other than income taxes in 2007 reflect lower property taxes primarily due to a property tax reduction enacted by the Florida legislature partly offset by higher property taxes due to growth in plant in service balances. In 2006, taxes other than income taxes include higher property taxes reflecting growth in plant in service balances. 30 Interest charges for 2007 reflect additional borrowings, including the $652 million of storm recovery bonds issued in May 2007. Interest charges for 2006 increased primarily due to higher average debt balances used to fund increased investment in generation, transmission and distribution expansion, and to pay for unrecovered fuel and storm restoration costs. Average interest rates in 2007 were approximately the same as the prior year while 2006 rates increased approximately 20 basis points. The increase in AFUDC in 2007 is primarily attributable to additional AFUDC on two natural gas fired combined cycle units of approximately 1,220 mw each at FPLs West County Energy Center in western Palm Beach County, Florida, the steam generator replacement project at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 and nuclear spent fuel storage projects, partially offset by lower AFUDC on Turkey Point Unit No. 5, which was placed in service in 2007. The decline in AFUDC in 2006 is primarily attributable to the placement of the additional Martin and Manatee units in service on June 30, 2005, partially offset by increased AFUDC on Turkey Point Unit No. 5. Interest income in 2007 declined reflecting the cessation of interest on FPLs unrecovered balance of the storm reserve deficiency, which was collected with the issuance of the storm recovery bonds in May 2007. Interest income increased in 2006 reflecting higher interest accrued on the unrecovered balance of the storm reserve deficiency. FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers. The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale transactions. In 2007, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 4% of FPLs total operating revenues. Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier. Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the retail electric industry in Florida in the near future. If the basis of regulation for some or all of FPLs business changes from cost based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators spec ify an alternative means of recovery or refund. Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Regulatory Accounting. In 2007, the FPSC denied FPLs need petition for two ultra super critical pulverized coal generating units in Glades County, Florida. FPL subsequently filed a petition with the FPSC requesting authorization to defer, until the next retail base rate proceeding, approximately $35 million of preconstruction costs associated with the coal units, with amortization over a five year period beginning when new base rates are implemented. These costs are currently reflected in other assets on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets. Any portion of these costs not approved for recovery would be expensed. A decision is expected in April 2008. FPL is currently constructing two natural gas fired combined cycle units of approximately 1,220 mw each at its West County Energy Center which are expected to be in service by mid 2009 and 2010. FPL is proposing to build a third natural gas fired combined cycle unit of approximately 1,220 mw at the same sit e that would be operational in 2011. FPL is in the process of adding approximately 400 mw of baseload capacity at its existing nuclear units at St. Lucie and Turkey Point, which is projected to be in service by the end of 2012. In addition, FPL is seeking FPSC approval for two additional nuclear units totaling between 2,200 mw and 3,040 mw of baseload capacity at its Turkey Point site with projected in service dates between 2018 and 2020; an FPSC decision is expected in March 2008. Additional approvals from other regulatory agencies will also be required later in the process. In 2007, the FPSC approved a nuclear cost recovery rule that provides for the recovery of prudently incurred pre construction costs and carrying charges (equal to the pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through levelized charges under the capacity clause and for the recovery of construction costs, once the new capacity goes into service, through a base rate increa se. As part of the FPSCs approval of the addition of approximately 400 mw of baseload capacity to FPLs existing nuclear units, FPL received approval to recover costs associated with the project through the nuclear cost recovery rule. The estimated costs of the new nuclear units are not included in the capital expenditures table in Note 16 Commitments because the new units are subject to, among other things, various regulatory and other approvals. 31 FPL Energy FPL Energys net income for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $540 million, $610 million and $203 million, respectively, a decrease in 2007 of $70 million and an increase in 2006 of $407 million. The primary drivers, on an after tax basis, of these changes were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (millions) New investments (a) $ 78 $ 112 Existing assets (a) 112 54 Full energy and capacity requirements services and trading 56 26 Restructuring activities and asset sales (14 ) (20 ) Indonesian project gain (63 ) 63 Interest expense and other (61 ) (32 ) Change in unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity (b) (178 ) 204 Net income increase (decrease) $ (70 ) $ 407 (a) Includes PTCs on wind projects but does not include allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. See Note 1 Income Taxes. Results from new projects are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation. A projects results are included in existing assets beginning with the thirteenth month of operation. (b) For discussion of derivative instruments, see Note 4 and Overview. The increase in FPL Energys 2007 results from new investment reflects the addition of over 3,400 mw of wind and nuclear generation during or after 2006. The 2006 increase reflects over 1,800 mw of wind, nuclear and solar generation during or after 2005. In 2007, FPL Energys existing asset portfolio benefited from improved market conditions in the NEPOOL and ERCOT regions and the absence of a refueling outage at the Seabrook nuclear facility. This was partially offset by lower wind resource, by the effect of the completion, in January 2007, of the amortization of deferred income under a power purchase agreement related to a combined cycle plant in the NEPOOL region and by the reduction in the contracted capacity price at a combined cycle plant in the PJM region. Results in the NEPOOL and PJM regions also benefited from new FERC approved forward capacity markets that began in December 2006 and June 2007, respectively. In 2006, the existing portfolio benefited from improved market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions and a higher wind resource. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a longer refueling outage in 2006 as compared to 2005 at the Seabrook nuclear facility. In addit ion, included in the existing assets line item was a $4 million after tax ($8 million pretax) impairment charge recorded by FPL Energy in 2006 related to a California coal plant as well as the favorable effect of prior contract restructurings. See Note 5 FPL Energy. FPL Energys 2007 and 2006 financial results benefited from increased gains from its full energy and capacity requirements services and trading activities. Full energy and capacity requirements services include load following services, which require the supplier of energy to vary the quantity delivered based on the load demand needs of the customer, as well as various ancillary services. The decrease in 2007 of restructuring activities and asset sales is primarily due to the absence of a $12 million after tax gain recorded in 2006 on the sale of wind development rights. The 2006 amounts were lower than 2005 reflecting the absence of gains recorded in 2005 from asset sales and from a contract restructuring, partly offset by the 2006 gain on the sale of wind development rights. The Indonesian project gain reflects a $63 million after tax gain ($97 million pretax) recorded by FPL Energy in 2006 as the result of a court judgment. In both 2007 and 2006, interest expense and other reflects higher interest expense primarily due to higher debt balances as a result of growth in the business as well as an increase in average interest rates of approximately 9 basis points and 38 basis points for 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, interest and other in both 2007 and 2006 includes higher corporate general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the business. In 2007 and 2005, FPL Energy recorded after tax net unrealized mark to market losses on non qualifying hedges of approximately $86 million and $112 million, respectively. During 2006, FPL Energy recorded after tax net unrealized mark to market gains of approximately $92 million. The change in unrealized mark to market activity for 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to increased forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains as the underlying transactions were realized during 2007. The change in unrealized mark to market activity for 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to decreased forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market losses as the underlying transactions were realized during 2006. 32 FPL Energys operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $84 million reflecting $342 million of unrealized mark to market losses from non qualifying hedges compared to $496 million of gains on such hedges in the 2006 period. Excluding this mark to market activity, revenues benefited from project additions, favorable market conditions in the NEPOOL and ERCOT regions, the absence of a refueling outage at the Seabrook nuclear facility and increased gains from its full energy and capacity requirements services, partially offset by unfavorable wind resource. Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1,337 million primarily due to gains of $496 million on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity in 2006 compared to losses on such hedges of $249 million in the 2005 period. Excluding this mark to market activity, revenues benefited from project additions, favorable market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions, an d a higher wind resource, partially offset by the impact of the longer refueling outage in 2006 as compared to 2005 for the Seabrook nuclear facility. Also, operating revenues in 2006 include approximately $12 million related to the settlement of certain operational performance issues with wind turbine equipment suppliers. FPL Energys operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $50 million reflecting $198 million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to $318 million of losses on such hedges in the 2006 period. Excluding these mark to market changes which are reflected in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income, operating expenses increased primarily due to project additions, higher fuel costs and higher corporate general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the business. FPL Energys operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $736 million reflecting $318 million of unrealized mark to market losses from non qualifying hedges compared to $63 million of gains on such hedges in the 2005 period. Excluding these mark to market changes, operating expenses increased primarily due to project additions and increased fuel costs as a result of market conditio ns. Equity in earnings of equity method investees decreased $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the absence of the $97 million Indonesian project gain discussed above and due to the effect of the completion, in January 2007, of the amortization of deferred income under a power purchase agreement related to a combined cycle plant in the NEPOOL region, partially offset by unrealized mark to market losses on non qualifying hedges of $26 million in 2006. In 2006, equity in earnings of equity method investees increased $57 million primarily due to the $97 million Indonesian project gain discussed above and the favorable effect on operating results from a prior contract restructuring. These factors were partially offset by unrealized mark to market losses of approximately $26 million from non qualifying hedge activity in 2006 compared to an approximately $2 million gain on such hedges in 2005 and the absence of an approximately $13 million pretax gain on a contract restructuring recorded in 2005. FPL Energys interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 increased $43 million and $46 million, respectively, reflecting higher average debt balances to support growth in the business and an increase in average interest rates. Gains (losses) on disposal of assets in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income for 2006 reflect an approximately $20 million pretax gain for the sale of wind development rights. In 2005, this line item included approximately $44 million of pretax gains on the sale of FPL Energy joint venture projects. PTCs from FPL Energys wind projects are reflected in FPL Energys earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, and amounted to approximately $219 million, $167 million and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In September 2007, FPL Energy completed the acquisition of Point Beach, a two unit, 1,023 mw nuclear power plant located in Wisconsin from Wisconsin Electric Power Company (We Energies). FPL Energy purchased the plant, including nuclear fuel, inventory and other items, for a total of approximately $933 million. All of the power from Point Beach is being sold under a long term power purchase contract to We Energies through the current NRC license terms of 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2. FPL Energy is responsible for management and operation of the plant, as well as for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility, and received $390 million of decommissioning funds at closing. See Note 2. FPL Energy expects its future portfolio capacity growth to come primarily from wind and solar development and from asset acquisitions. FPL Energy plans to add a total of 8,000 mw 10,000 mw of new wind generation over the 2007 2012 period, of which 1,064 mw were added in 2007. FPL Energy expects to add at least 1,100 mw in 2008, of which approximately 700 mw are under construction. In addition, FPL Energy intends to pursue opportunities for new solar generating facilities. The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other things, continued public policy support. Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary by geographic region. Revenues from electricity sales in these markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other ancillary services. Some of the factors affecting success in these markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind, solar and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth and exposure to legal and regulatory changes. 33 Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for FPL Energy. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets. FPL Energy seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants. The major markets in which FPL Energy operates have shown signs of continued improvement since 2004, such as improved spark spreads and energy prices in the ERCOT and NEPOOL regions. The combination of new wind projects, expected increase in contribution from merchant assets and asset acquisitions are expected to be the key drivers supporting FPL Energys growth over the next few years. FPL Energys earnings are subject to variability due to, among other things, operational performance, commodity price exposure, counterparty performance, weather conditions and project restructuring activities. FPL Energys exposure to commodity price risk is reduced by the degree of contract coverage obtained for 2008 and 2009. Therefore, if FPL Energys plants do not perform as expected, FPL Energy could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. FPL Energys results are affected by fluctuations in weather. In addition to the effect of temperature, which is reflected in commodity prices and demand, changes in weather affect production levels of the wind portfolio as well as the hydro units in Maine. In managing its exposure to commodity prices, FPL Energy is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations. FPL Energy actively manages the trade off between market risk and credit risk, as well as exposure with individual counterparties as a function of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of FPL Energys 2008 contracted revenues are with investment grade counterparties. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of interest expense, the operating results of FPL FiberNet and other business activities as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates interest charges to FPL Energy based on a deemed capital structure at FPL Energy of 50% debt for operating projects and 100% debt for projects under construction. Each subsidiarys income taxes are calculated based on the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be utilized on a separate return basis, but are utilized on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or detriments are recorded at Corporate and Other. The major components of Corporate and Other results, on an after tax basis, are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (millions) Interest expense $ (90 ) $ (97 ) $ (90 ) Interest income 22 6 18 FPL FiberNet impairment charges (2 ) (60 ) Merger costs (14 ) Federal and state tax benefits 3 30 23 Gains on sale and termination of leveraged lease agreements 6 Other 3 4 (7 ) Net loss $ (64 ) $ (131 ) $ (50 ) Interest expense decreased in 2007 reflecting lower average debt balances but increased in 2006 due to higher average debt balances and slightly higher rates. In 2007, interest income reflects earnings on temporary investments which had been accumulated to purchase Point Beach as well as net interest recorded on unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." The decline in interest income in 2006 reflects the repayment of a loan by a third party in the fourth quarter of 2005. For discussion of FPL FiberNets impairment charges, see Note 5 Corporate and Other. The 2006 merger costs represent costs associated with the proposed merger between FPL Group and Constellation Energy, which was terminated in October 2006. The federal and state tax benefits are primarily due to FPL Energys growth throughout the United States and other consolidating tax adjustments.& nbsp; The 2005 gains on sale and termination of leveraged lease agreements ($10 million on a pretax basis) are included in gains on disposal of assets in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income. Other includes all other corporate income and expenses as well as other business activities. Corporate and Others operating revenues increased in 2006 primarily due to the transfer, effective January 1, 2006, of FPLs retail gas contracts to a subsidiary of FPL Group Capital. The increase in operating expenses in 2006 is primarily due to the $98 million pretax impairment charge at FPL FiberNet as well as the transfer of FPLs retail gas contracts. 34 Liquidity and Capital Resources FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for working capital, capital expenditures and investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, to pay maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, to redeem outstanding debt and or repurchase common stock. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated funds and the issuance, from time to time, of debt and equity securities, consistent with FPL Groups and FPLs objective of maintaining, on a long term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. Credit ratings and significant volatility in the financial markets can affect FPL Groups, FPLs and FPL Group Capitals ability to obtain short and long term financing, the cost of such financing and the execution of their respective financing strategies. Cash Flow The changes in cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows: FPL Group FPL Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,593 $ 2,498 $ 1,547 $ 2,163 $ 1,668 $ 1,238 Net cash used in investing activities (4,578 ) (3,807 ) (2,165 ) (2,214 ) (1,933 ) (1,816 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 655 1,399 923 50 273 569 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (330 ) $ 90 $ 305 $ (1 ) $ 8 $ (9 ) FPL Groups cash and cash equivalents decreased for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflecting capital investments by FPL and FPL Energy, the payment of common stock dividends to FPL Group shareholders and an increase in customer receivables. These outflows were partially offset by cash generated by net income, net issuances of both long and short term debt, the sale of independent power investments, the return of margin cash collateral from counterparties and a distribution from Karaha Bodas Company, LLC (KBC). FPL Groups cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect cash generated by net income, the receipt of distributions from equity method investees, including a distribution from KBC as a result of a court judgment and the return of margin cash collateral from counterparties, partially offset by an increase in customer receivables at FPL Energy. Fluctuations in recoveries under FPLs cost recovery clauses, which do not significantly affect net income, can have a significant effect on cash flow from operations and make year to year comparisons difficult. FPL Groups cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect capital investments of approximately $1.8 billion by FPL to expand and enhance its electric system and generating facilities to ensure continued reliable service to meet the power needs of present and future customers and independent power investments at FPL Energy of approximately $2.9 billion, including the purchase of Point Beach. See Note 2. FPL Groups cash flows from investing activities also includes approximately $700 million of cash generated from the sale of differential membership interests (see Note 11 Sale of Differential Membership Interests) and amounts related to the purchase and sale of restricted securities held in the special use funds, including the reinvestment of fund earnings and new contributions, as well as other investment activity. During the year ended December 31, 2007, FPL Group generated proceeds from financing activities, net of related issuance costs, of approximately $3.3 billion, including the following debt issuances: Company Debt Issued Interest Rate(s) Principal Amount Maturity Date(s) (millions) FPL first mortgage bonds 5.55% and 5.85% $ 600 2017 and 2037 FPL subsidiary storm recovery bonds 5.0440% 5.2555% 652 2013 2021 (a) FPL Group Capital term loan facility variable 50 2009 FPL Group Capital junior subordinated debentures (Series C E) 6.65% 7.45% 1,000 2067 FPL Energy subsidiaries limited recourse senior secured notes 6.31% 7.26% 700 2015 2037 FPL Energy subsidiaries term loan variable 250 2012 $ 3,252 (a) Although principal on the storm recovery bonds is due on the final maturity date (the date by which the principal must be repaid to prevent a default) for each tranche, it is expected to be paid semiannually and sequentially beginning February 1, 2008, when the first semiannual interest payment became due. 35 During the year ended December 31, 2007, FPL Group paid out approximately $2.6 billion for financing activities, including $1.075 billion for maturing FPL Group Capital debentures, $250 million for the early repayment of an FPL revolving term loan facility, $541 million for debt maturities and principal repayment of FPL Energy subsidiary debt, a net decrease in short term debt of $80 million (net of a $212 million increase at FPL) and $654 million for the payment of dividends on FPL Groups common stock. In January 2008, FPL issued $600 million principal amount of 5.95% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2038. Also, in January 2008, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Energy entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of 3.2050% on $195 million of its variable rate limited recourse debt in order to limit cash flow exposure. FPL Groups cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006 benefited from net issuances of debt, the issuance of common stock and the recovery from customers of previously incurred fuel and storm costs at FPL, which were offset by an increase in FPLs customer receivables and the return of margin cash collateral and payment of margin cash collateral to counterparties. The funds generated were used to pay for capital expenditures at FPL, additional investments at FPL Energy, common stock dividends, storm related costs at FPL and to carry an increase in fossil fuel inventory. FPL Groups cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflect the benefit of net issuances of debt, the issuance of common stock, the receipt of payment of a secured third party loan, the receipt of margin cash collateral primarily from FPLs counterparties related to energy contracts and the recovery from customers of a portion of the 2004 storm restoration costs at FPL. The funds generated were used to pay for common stock dividends, capital expenditures at FPL, additional investments at FPL Energy, FPL storm restoration costs and to fund underrecovered fuel costs at FPL caused primarily by higher than anticipated fuel prices. The following provides various metrics regarding FPL Groups (including FPLs) and FPLs outstanding debt: FPL Group FPL December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Weighted average annual interest rate (a) 6.2 % 6.1 % 5.4 % 5.4 % Weighted average life (years) 17.4 13.1 16.2 17.9 Annual average of floating rate debt to total debt (a) 20 % 31 % 25 % 33 % (a) Calculations include interest rate swaps. Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures FPL Groups and FPLs commitments at December 31, 2007 were as follows: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (millions) Long term debt, including interest: (a) FPL $ 521 $ 521 $ 291 $ 292 $ 293 $ 8,773 $ 10,691 FPL Energy 870 431 414 392 417 2,768 5,292 Corporate and Other 736 1,021 168 768 134 8,898 11,725 Purchase obligations: FPL (b) 6,395 5,095 3,480 3,145 2,945 5,565 26,625 FPL Energy (c) 1,572 107 94 57 57 730 2,617 Asset retirement activities: (d) FPL (e) 11,610 11,610 FPL Energy (f) 1 2 7,168 7,171 Other Commitments: FPL Energy (g) 351 351 Total $ 10,095 $ 7,175 $ 4,447 $ 4,654 $ 3,848 $ 45,863 $ 76,082 (a) Includes principal, interest and interest rate swaps. Variable rate interest was computed using December 31, 2007 rates. (b) Represents required capacity and minimum payments under long term purchased power and fuel contracts, the majority of which are recoverable through various cost recovery clauses (see Note 16 Contracts), and projected capital expenditures through 2012 to meet, among other things, increased electricity usage and customer growth, capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities and estimated capital costs associated with Storm Secure. Estimated capital costs associated with Storm Secure are subject to change over time based on, among other things, productivity enhancements and prioritization. See Note 16 Commitments. (c) Represents firm commitments primarily in connection with the purchase of wind turbines and towers, natural gas transportation, purchase and storage, firm transmission service, nuclear fuel and a portion of its projected capital expenditures. See Note 16 Commitments and Contracts. (d) Represents expected cash payments adjusted for inflation for estimated costs to perform asset retirement activities. (e) At December 31, 2007, FPL had approximately $2,371 million in restricted trust funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPLs nuclear units, which are included in FPL Groups and FPLs special use funds. (f) At December 31, 2007, FPL Energys 88.23% portion of Seabrooks and 70% portion of Duane Arnolds and its Point Beachs restricted trust funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission its nuclear units totaled approximately $982 million and are included in FPL Groups special use funds. (g) Represents estimated cash distributions related to certain membership interests. See Note 11 Sale of Differential Membership Interests. 36 In February 2008, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Group Capital committed to lend to a third party up to $500 million under a construction and term loan. The loan provides for a single $500 million draw, which is expected to occur in late 2009. The loan will initially bear interest at a variable rate and will be converted to a 20 year, fixed rate term loan upon completion of construction. Guarantees and Letters of Credit FPL Group and FPL obtain letters of credit and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. At December 31, 2007, FPL Group had standby letters of credit of approximately $733 million ($63 million for FPL) and approximately $7,947 million notional amount of guarantees ($648 million for FPL), of which approximately $5,511 million ($63 million for FPL) have expirations within the next five years. An aggregate of approximately $404 million of the standby letters of credit at December 31, 2007 were issued under FPLs and FPL Group Capitals credit facilities. See Available Liquidity below. These letters of credit and guarantees support the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities, debt related reserves, nuclear activities, the commercial paper program of FPLs consolidated VIE from which it leases nuclear fuel and other contractual agreements. Each of FPL Group a nd FPL believe it is unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of credit and guarantees. At December 31, 2007, FPL Group and FPL did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit and guarantees. In addition, FPL Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group Capital, including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees, and FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of FPL Energy and its subsidiaries. See Note 16 Commitments. Certain subsidiaries of FPL Energy have contracts that require certain projects to meet annual minimum generation amounts. Failure to meet the annual minimum generation amounts would result in the FPL Energy subsidiary becoming liable for liquidated damages. Based on past performance of these and similar projects and current forward prices, management believes that the exposure associated with these liquidated damages provisions is not material. Available Liquidity At December 31, 2007, FPL Groups total available net liquidity was approximately $6.6 billion, of which FPLs was approximately $2.8 billion. The components of each companys net available liquidity at December 31, 2007 were as follows: FPL FPL Group Capital FPL Group Consoli dated Maturity Date FPL FPL Group Capital (millions) Bank revolving lines of credit (a) $ 2,500 $ 4,000 $ 6,500 2012 2012 Less letters of credit 46 358 404 2,454 3,642 6,096 Revolving term loan facility 250 250 2011 Less borrowings 250 250 Cash and cash equivalents 63 227 290 Net available liquidity $ 2,767 $ 3,869 $ 6,636 (a) Provide for the issuance of letters of credit up to $6.5 billion and are available to support the companies commercial paper programs and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies or their subsidiaries operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss), as well as for general corporate purposes. FPL Group (which guarantees the payment of FPL Group Capitals credit facilities pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement) is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to total capitalization under the terms of FPL Group Capitals credit facility. FPL is required to maintain a minimum ratio of funded debt to total capitalization under the terms of FPLs credit facility and revolving term loan facility. At December 31, 2007, each of FPL Group and FPL was in compliance with its respective ratio. In addition to the amounts in the table above, FPL Group Capital and FPL have each established an uncommitted credit facility with a bank to be used for general corporate purposes. The bank may, at its discretion upon the request of FPL Group Capital or FPL, make a short term loan or loans to FPL Group Capital or FPL in an aggregate amount determined by the bank, which is subject to change at any time. The terms of the specific borrowings under the uncommitted credit facilities, including maturity, are set at the time borrowing requests are made by FPL Group Capital or FPL. At December 31, 2007, there were no amounts outstanding for either FPL Group Capital or FPL under the uncommitted credit facilities. In addition, at December 31, 2007, FPL had restricted funds set aside (included in special use funds on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets) that provide FPL the capacity to absorb up to approximately $213 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking recovery through a rate adjustment from the FPSC. See Note 1 Securitization. Also, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Energy has established a $100 million letter of credit facility which expires in 2017 and serves as security for certain obligations under commodity hedge agreements entered into by the subsidiary. 37 Shelf Registration In September 2006, FPL Group, FPL Group Capital, FPL and certain affiliated trusts filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective board of directors. As of February 27, 2008, securities that may be issued under the registration statement, as subsequently amended, which became effective upon filing, include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, first mortgage bonds, preferred trust securities, common stock, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, preferred stock and guarantees related to certain of those securities. As of February 27, 2008, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital had $2.5 billion (issuable by either or both of them up to such aggregate amount) of board authorized available capacity, and FPL had $900 million of board authorized available capac ity. Covenants FPL Groups charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of FPL Group to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. During the first quarter of 2007, FPL Group increased its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.375 to $0.41 per share. In February 2008, FPL Group announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.41 to $0.445 per share. FPL pays dividends to FPL Group in a manner consistent with FPLs long term targeted capital structure. The mortgage securing FPLs first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to FPL Group and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. In light of FPLs current financial conditi on and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations. Under the mortgage, in some cases, the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock is restricted. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPLs use of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2007, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage. FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPLs first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior FPL indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, after giving effect to the January 2008 issuance of $600 million of 5.95% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2038, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 would have been approximately 5.5 times the annual interest requirements and approximately 3.2 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortga ge trustee. As of December 31, 2007, after giving effect to the January 2008 issuance of $600 million of 5.95% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2038, FPL could have issued in excess of $5.5 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.5 billion based on retired first mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2007, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes. In September 2006, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (September 2006 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capitals offering of $350 million principal amount of Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 and $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (collectively, Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long term indebtedness (covered debt) of FPL Group Capital (other than the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the September 2006 RCC. The September 2006 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem, and FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series A and Series B junior subordinated deb entures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2006 RCC. Qualifying securities are securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 180 days prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures. In June 2007, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (June 2007 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capitals offering of $400 million principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series C junior subordinated debentures).

FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the June 2007 RCC. The June 2007 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (c ollectively, defease), and FPL Group and any majority owned subsidiary of FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before June 15, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series C junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the June 2007 RCC. 38 In September 2007, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (September 2007 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capitals offering of $250 million principal amount of its Series D Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 and $350 million principal amount of Series E Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (collectively, Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures). The September 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of FPL Group Capital (other than the Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Sec urities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the September 2007 RCC. The September 2007 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem, purchase, or defease, and FPL Group and any majority owned subsidiary of FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures on or before September 1, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series D and Serie s E junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2007 RCC. Credit Ratings Securities of FPL Group and its subsidiaries are currently rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). At February 27, 2008, Moodys, S&P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital: Moodys (a) S&P (a) Fitch (a) FPL Group: (b) Corporate credit rating A2 A A FPL: (b) Corporate credit rating A1 A A First mortgage bonds Aa3 A AA Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds Aa3/VMIG 1 A A+ Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F 1 FPL Group Capital: (b) Corporate credit rating N/A A A Debentures A2 A A Junior subordinated debentures A3 BBB+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F 1 (a) A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. (b) The outlook indicated by each of Moodys, S&P and Fitch is stable. FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of debt outstanding. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities maintained by FPL Group Capital and FPL, the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating is not a condition to drawing upon those credit facilities. However, commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when ratings change. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities, and could result in the requirement that FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, post collateral under certain power purchase and other agreements. FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, may be req uired to post collateral in excess of collateral threshold amounts when FPL Groups exposure to the counterparty under the applicable trading agreement exceeds such threshold. Other In June 2005, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL Group completed the acquisition of Gexa Corp., a retail electric provider in Texas. Each share of Gexa Corp.s outstanding common stock was converted into 0.1682 of a share of FPL Group common stock. Assuming the exercise of Gexa Corp.s options and warrants net of cash to be received upon exercise, the aggregate value of the consideration for the acquisition of Gexa Corp. was approximately $73 million, payable in shares of FPL Group common stock. New Accounting Rules and Interpretations Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements." See Note 1 Fair Value Measurements. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." See Note 3. 39 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." See Note 1 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Accounting for Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 141(R), "Business Combinations." This statement retains the fundamental requirements in FAS 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which FAS 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii) discloses the nature and financial effects of the business combination; and requires restructuring and acquisition related costs to be expensed. FPL Group and FPL will be required to adopt FAS 141(R) for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. Accounting for Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51," to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The standard clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. FPL Group and FPL will be required to adopt FAS 160 on January 1, 2009. FAS 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. All other requirements of FAS 160 will be applied prospectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates FPL Groups and FPLs significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Critical accounting polices are those that FPL Group and FPL believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. FPL Group and FPL consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statements: Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities FPL Group and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate risk associated with long term debt. In addition, FPL Group, through FPL Energy, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets. FPL Energy provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Accounting pronouncements, which require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, apply not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market under FAS 133, as amended, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and fuel. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. In general, the models estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. The near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contract. Substantially all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by FPL are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel or capacity clauses. In FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, changes in derivative fair values are recognized in current earnings, unless the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge. For those transactions accounted for as ca sh flow hedges, much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of common shareholders equity, rather than being recognized in current earnings. For those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges, the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged. 40 Since FAS 133 became effective in 2001, the FASB has discussed and from time to time issued implementation guidance related to FAS 133. In particular, much of the interpretive guidance affects when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from the provisions of FAS 133. Despite the large volume of implementation guidance, FAS 133 and the supplemental guidance do not provide specific guidance on all contract issues. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying FAS 133 and its interpretations. A result of changes in interpretation could be that contracts that currently are excluded from the provisions of FAS 133 would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of income. Certain economic hedging transactions at FPL Energy do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the statement of income, often resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings. This could be significant to FPL Energys results because often the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market (such as the physical assets from which power is generated) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. Because of this, FPL Groups management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instrum ents, see Note 4 and also see Managements Discussion Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits FPL Group sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries. FPL Group also has a supplemental executive retirement plan which includes a non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees. In addition to pension benefits, FPL Group sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits (other benefits plan) for retirees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan. The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance. FPL Gro up allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria. FPL Group adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158 effective December 31, 2006. The measurement date provisions of FAS 158 require that FPL Group measure plan assets and liabilities as of its year end no later than December 31, 2008 with any resulting adjustments to plan assets, benefit obligations, and accumulated other comprehensive income recorded to retained earnings. Since FPL Group is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, the results of implementing all provisions of FAS 158 are reflected at FPL Group and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations related to the recognition provision of FAS 158 that were estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income were classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at FPL Group in accordance with regulatory treatment. In addition, adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of implementing the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 that are estimated to be allocable to FPL will be recorded as an adjustment to the previously established regulatory assets and liabilities. FPL Group currently uses a measurement date of September 30 for its pension and other benefits plans. In lieu of remeasuring plan assets and obligations as of January 1, 2008, FPL Group has elected to calculate the net periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen month period from September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008 using the September 30, 2007 measurement date. Upon adoption of the measurement date provisions, FPL Group will record an adjustment to increase 2008 beginning retained earnings by approximately $13 million representing three fifteenths of net periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen month period from September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Included in the adjustment to retained earnings is approximately $1 million related to the reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income and approximately $3 million related to the reduction in net regulatory liabilities. 41 FPL Groups income from its pension plan, net of the cost of the other benefits plan, was approximately $69 million, $65 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The corresponding amounts allocated to FPL were $51 million, $52 million and $39 million, respectively. Pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all years for the pension plan and 8.00%, 7.75% and 7.75% for the other benefits plan for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, assumed increases in future compensation levels of 4% for all years, and weighted average discount rates of 5.85%, 5.50% and 5.50% for the pension plan and 5.90%, 5.50% and 5.50% for the other benefits plan for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, re spectively. Based on current health care costs (as related to other benefits), the projected 2008 trend assumption used to measure the expected cost of health care benefits covered by the plans for all age groups are 7.5% for medical benefits and 9.5% for prescription drug benefits. These rates are assumed to decrease over the next nine years to the ultimate trend rate of 5.5% and remain at that level thereafter. The ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in 2012 for medical costs and 2016 for prescription drug costs. In developing these assumptions, FPL Group evaluated input from its actuaries, as well as information available in the marketplace. For the expected long term rate of return on fund assets, FPL Group considered 10 year and 20 year historical median returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds. FPL Group also considered its funds historical compounded returns. FPL Group believes that 7.75% and 8.00% are reasonable long term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets, respectively. FPL Group will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as necessary. FPL Group bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits plan expense and income only when they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets. The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant: Increase in 2007 Net Periodic Cost Change in Assumption FPL Group FPL (millions) Expected long term rate of return (0.5 )% $ 16 $ 13 Discount rate (0.5 )% $ 5 $ 4 Salary increase 0.5 % $ 7 $ 5 Health care cost trend rate (a) 1.0 % $ $ (a) Assumed healthcare cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits. However, this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in FPL Groups other benefits plan. The fair value of plan assets has increased from $3.2 billion at September 30, 2006 to $3.6 billion at September 30, 2007 for the pension plan and increased from $48 million at September 30, 2006 to $49 million at September 30, 2007 for the other benefits plan. Management believes that, based on the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, FPL Group will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. In December 2007, $28 million was transferred from the qualified pension plan as reimbursement for eligible retiree medical expenses paid by FPL Group during the year pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. FPL Group anticipates paying approximately $30 million for eligible retiree medical expenses on behalf of the other benefits plan during 2008 with substantially all of that amount being reimbursed through a transfer of assets from the qualified pension plan. See Note 3. Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets FPL Group evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable as described in FAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Under that standard, an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the assets fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. 42 The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized. In 2006, FPL FiberNet performed an impairment analysis and concluded that an impairment charge related to its metro market assets was necessary. The critical assumptions and estimates used in the analysis include revenue additions, projected capital expenditures and a discount rate. A 10% increase in the revenue growth rate or a 10% decrease in projected capital expenditures would have resulted in no impairment, while a 10% decrease in the revenue growth rate or a 10% increase in projected capital expenditures would increase the impairment charge by less than $5 million. An increase or decrease of 1% in the discount rate would have a corresponding change to the impairment charge of approximately $3 million. See Note 5 Corporate and Other. Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil Dismantlement FPL Group and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations under FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations." FAS 143 and FIN 47 require that a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation (ARO) be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets. See Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 15. For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the FPSC at least every five years. The most recent studies, filed in 2005, indicate that FPLs portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage, is $10.9 billion, or $2.2 billion in 2007 dollars. The studies reflect, among other things, the 20 year license extensions of FPLs nuclear units and support the suspension, effective September 2005, of the $79 million annual decommissioning accrual. At December 31, 2007, $2,658 million was accrued for nuclear decommissioning, of which $1,624 million was recorded as an ARO, $54 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $887 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $201 million was included in accrued asset removal costs (a regulatory liability) on the consolidated balance sheets. FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, fossil dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies, which became effective January 1, 2007, indicated that FPLs portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil units is $707 million. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered AROs. At December 31, 2007, $335 million was accrued for fossil dismantlement costs, of which $24 million was recorded as an ARO, $8 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $34 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $285 million was included in accrued asset removal costs (a regulatory liability) on the consolidated balance sheets. FPL Energy records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs in accordance with FAS 143 and FIN 47 which is determined using various internal and external data. FPL Energys portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage, is approximately $6.6 billion, or $1.4 billion expressed in 2007 dollars. The liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At December 31, 2007, the ARO for nuclear decommissioning of FPL Energys nuclear plants totaled approximately $456 million. The calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation under FAS 143 and FIN 47. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, FPL Group and FPL also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, FPL Group and FPL will be required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed es calation rates would increase FPL Groups and FPLs ARO as of December 31, 2007 by $212 million and $166 million, respectively. Regulatory Accounting FPL follows the accounting practices set forth in FAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." FAS 71 indicates that regulators can create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. If FPL were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the con struction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of FAS 71 is assessed at each reporting period. 43 FPL Groups and FPLs regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows: FPL Group FPL December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Regulatory assets: (millions) Current: Deferred clause and franchise expenses $ 103 $ 167 $ 103 $ 167 Securitized storm recovery costs/storm reserve deficiency $ 59 $ 106 $ 59 $ 106 Derivatives $ 117 $ 921 $ 117 $ 921 Other $ 2 $ 3 $ $ Noncurrent: Securitized storm recovery costs/storm reserve deficiency $ 756 $ 762 $ 756 $ 762 Deferred clause expenses $ 121 $ $ 121 $ Unamortized loss on reacquired debt $ 36 $ 39 $ 36 $ 39 Other $ 95 $ 80 $ 72 $ 37 Regulatory liabilities: Current: Deferred clause and franchise revenues $ 18 $ 37 $ 18 $ 37 Pension $ 24 $ 17 $ $ Noncurrent: Accrued asset removal costs $ 2,098 $ 2,044 $ 2,098 $ 2,044 Asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference $ 921 $ 868 $ 921 $ 868 Pension $ 696 $ 531 $ $ Other $ 236 $ 209 $ 235 $ 209 See Note 1 for a discussion of FPL Groups and FPLs other significant accounting policies. Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity Energy Marketing and Trading Certain of FPL Groups subsidiaries, including FPL and FPL Energy, use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, FPL Group, through FPL Energy, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets. FPL Energy provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market under FAS 133, as amended, are recorded on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. For FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly FPL Energy, essentially all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases and sales are recognized net in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income unless hedge accounting is applied. See Note 4. 44 The changes in the fair value of FPL Groups consolidated subsidiaries energy contract derivative instruments were as follows: Hedges on Owned Assets Trading Non Qualifying OCI FPL Cost Recovery Clauses FPL Group Total (millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005 $ 2 $ (176 ) $ (373 ) $ 757 $ 210 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts 26 107 56 325 514 Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI 261 261 Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings 31 31 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized (23 ) 46 (2,003 ) (1,980 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 5 8 (56 ) (921 ) (964 ) Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (8 ) (95 ) 39 870 806 Value of contracts purchased/previously not consolidated 23 23 Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI (92 ) (92 ) Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings 3 3 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 5 (77 ) (68 ) (140 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007 2 (138 ) (109 ) (119 ) (364 ) Net option premium payments (receipts) (27 ) 22 (5 ) Net cash collateral paid 9 13 2 15 39 Total mark to market energy contract net liabilities at December 31, 2007 $ (16 ) $ (103 ) $ (107 ) $ (104 ) $ (330 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2007 shown above are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows: December 31, 2007 (millions) Current derivative assets $ 182 Noncurrent other assets 98 Current derivative liabilities (280 ) Noncurrent derivative liabilities (330 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net liabilities $ (330 ) The sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Maturity 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Trading: (millions) Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices $ 3 $ 18 $ $ 2 $ 2 $ 1 $ 26 Prices provided by other external sources (8 ) 3 (5 ) Modeled 8 (20 ) (7 ) (19 ) Total 3 1 (7 ) 2 2 1 2 Owned Assets Non Qualifying: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices (34 ) (28 ) (32 ) (26 ) (25 ) (145 ) Prices provided by other external sources 37 6 1 (52 ) (8 ) Modeled 32 (1 ) (7 ) (1 ) (2 ) (6 ) 15 Total 35 5 (35 ) (32 ) (28 ) (83 ) (138 ) Owned Assets OCI: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices (31 ) (37 ) (24 ) (11 ) (103 ) Prices provided by other external sources Modeled (6 ) (6 ) Total (37 ) (37 ) (24 ) (11 ) (109 ) Owned Assets FPL Cost Recovery Clauses: Actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded) prices (111 ) (111 ) Prices provided by other external sources Modeled (3 ) (5 ) (8 ) Total (114 ) (5 ) (119 ) Total sources of fair value $ (113 ) $ (36 ) $ (66 ) $ (41 ) $ (26 ) $ (82 ) $ (364 ) Market Risk Sensitivity Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of FPL Group and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks. With respect to commodities, FPL Groups Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, is responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. 45 FPL Group and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. FPL Group manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees. Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. FPL Groups credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. Commodity price risk FPL Group uses a value at risk (VaR) model to measure market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the VaR figures are as follows: Trading Non Qualifying Hedges and Hedges in OCI and FPL Cost Recovery Clauses (a) Total FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group FPL FPL Energy FPL Group (millions) December 31, 2006 $ $ 2 $ 2 $ 89 $ 57 $ 54 $ 89 $ 60 $ 56 December 31, 2007 $ $ 6 $ 6 $ 51 $ 31 $ 37 $ 51 $ 28 $ 39 Average for the period ended December 31, 2007 $ $ 3 $ 3 $ 69 $ 35 $ 45 $ 69 $ 34 $ 46 (a) Non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI and FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements. Interest rate risk FPL Group and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and interest rate swaps. FPL Group and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate swaps and adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. The following are estimates of the fair value of FPL Groups and FPLs financial instruments: December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value FPL Group: (millions) Long term debt, including current maturities $ 12,681 $ 12,642 (a) $ 11,236 $ 11,314 (a) Fixed income securities: Special use funds $ 2,025 $ 2,025 (b) $ 1,430 $ 1,430 (b) Other investments $ 111 $ 111 (b) $ 93 $ 93 (b) Interest rate swaps net unrealized gain (loss) $ (28 ) $ (28 ) (c) $ 6 $ 6 (c) FPL: Long term debt, including current maturities $ 5,217 $ 5,185 (a) $ 4,214 $ 4,208 (a) Fixed income securities: Special use funds $ 1,436 $ 1,436 (b) $ 1,235 $ 1,235 (b) (a) Based on market prices provided by external sources. (b) Based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues. (c) Based on market prices modeled internally. The special use funds of FPL Group and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of FPL Groups and FPLs nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value. At FPL, adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The market value adjustments of FPL Groups non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer term securities, as deco mmissioning activities are not scheduled to begin until at least 2014 (2032 at FPL). FPL Group and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to adjust and mitigate interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements. At December 31, 2007, the estimated fair value for FPL Group interest rate swaps was as follows: 46 Notional Amount Effective Date Maturity Date Rate Paid Rate Received Estimated Fair Value (millions) (millions) Cash flow hedges FPL Energy: $ 164 February 2005 June 2008 4.255 % Variable (a) $ $ 70 December 2003 December 2017 4.245 % Variable (a) $ 23 April 2004 December 2017 3.845 % Variable (a) $ 207 December 2005 November 2019 4.905 % Variable (a) (5 ) $ 527 January 2007 January 2022 5.390 % Variable (b) (23 ) Total cash flow hedges $ (28 ) (a) Three month LIBOR (b) Six month LIBOR Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near term market change, the net fair value of FPL Groups net liabilities would increase by approximately $622 million ($240 million for FPL) at December 31, 2007. Equity price risk Included in the nuclear decommissioning reserve funds of FPL Group are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $1,456 million and $1,395 million ($1,063 million and $1,029 million for FPL) at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near term market change, would result in a $146 million ($106 million for FPL) reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL, or adjustments to OCI for FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, at December 31, 2007. Credit risk For all derivative and contractual transactions, FPL Groups energy marketing and trading operations, which includes FPLs energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Relevant considerations when assessing FPL Groups energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include: Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry. Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the United States. Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral. The use of master netting agreements to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. FPL Groups policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties. Based on FPL Groups policies and risk exposures related to credit, FPL Group and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial positions as a result of counterparty nonperformance. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 98% of FPL Groups and 100% of FPLs energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.
