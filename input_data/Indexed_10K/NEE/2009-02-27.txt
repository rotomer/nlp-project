Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. In the discussion of Results of Operations below, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. Overview FPL Group is one of the nations largest providers of electricity related services. It has two principal operating subsidiaries, FPL and NextEra Energy Resources. FPL serves more than 8.7 million people throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida. NextEra Energy Resources, FPL Groups competitive energy subsidiary, produces electricity primarily using natural gas, wind and nuclear resources. Together, FPLs and NextEra Energy Resources generating assets represented approximately 39,000 mw of capacity at December 31, 2008. See Item 2 Generating Facilities. Another of FPL Groups operating subsidiaries, FPL FiberNet, provides fiber optic services to FPL, telecommunications companies and other customers throughout Florida. 27 FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily through the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established as part of the 2005 rate agreement and through cost recovery clause mechanisms. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates. Over the last ten years, FPLs average annual customer growth has been 2.1%. However, beginning in 2007, FPL has experienced a slowdown in retail customer growth and a decline in non weather related usage per retail customer. Retail customer growth in 2008 was 0.3%, although during the fourth quarter of 2008 FPL experienced a decline in customer accounts of 0.2%. FPL believes that the economic slowdown, the downturn in the housing market and the credit crisis that have affected the country and the state of Florida have contributed to the slowdown in customer growth and to the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer. In 2008, FPL experienced an increase in inactive accounts (accounts with installed meters without corresponding customer names) and in low usage customers (customers using less than 200 kwh per month), which have contributed to the decline in retail customer growth and non weather related usage per retail customer. In November 2008, FPL notified the FPSC that it intends to initiate a base rate proceeding in March 2009. In the notification, FPL stated that it expects to request an $800 million to $950 million annual increase in base rates beginning on January 1, 2010 and an additional annual base rate increase beginning on January 1, 2011. These amounts exclude the effects of depreciation, which depend in part on the results of a detailed depreciation study that FPL is currently finalizing. Further, FPL expects to request that the FPSC continue to allow FPL to use the mechanism for recovery of the revenue requirements of any new power plant approved pursuant to the Siting Act that was established in FPLs 2005 rate agreement. Hearings on the base rate proceeding are expected during the third quarter of 2009 and a final decision is expected by the end of 2009. The final decision may approve rates that are different from those that FPL will request. FPLs business strategy is to provide customers clean, reliable energy at rates among the lowest in the state and nation. NextEra Energy Resources is in the competitive energy business with the majority of its operating revenues derived from wholesale electricity sales. Its business strategy is to maximize the value of its current portfolio, expand its U.S. market leading wind position and build its portfolio through asset acquisitions. NextEra Energy Resources plans to add a total of 7,000 mw to 9,000 mw of new wind generation over the 2008 to 2012 period, of which approximately 1,300 mw were added in 2008. NextEra Energy Resources expects to add approximately 1,100 mw in 2009, of which approximately 480 mw are either under construction or have obtained applicable internal approvals for construction. In addition, NextEra Energy Resources intends to pursue opportunities for new solar generating facilities. The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other things, continued public policy support, which includes, but is not limited to, support for the construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capacity, and access to reasonable capital and credit markets. If capital and credit market conditions change, this could alter spending plans at NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Resources market is diversified by region as well as by fuel source. NextEra Energy Resources sells a large percentage of its expected output to hedge against price volatility. Consequently, if NextEra Energy Resources plants do not perform as expected, NextEra Energy Resources could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. NextEra Energy Resources energy marketing and trading business is focused on managing commodity price risk and extracting maximum value from its assets. FPL Group and its subsidiaries segregate into two categories unrealized mark to market gains and losses on energy derivative transactions which are used to manage commodity price risk. The first category, referred to as trading activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts. The second category, referred to as non qualifying hedges, represents the net unrealized effect of derivative transactions entered into as economic hedges (but which do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended) and the ineffective portion of transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges. In addition, at FPL substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. FPL Groups management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings) internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as inputs in determining whether performance targets are met for performance based compensation under FPL Groups employee incentive compensation plans. FPL Group also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its earnings outlook to investors. Adjusted earnings exclude the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges and other than temporary impairment (OTTI) losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, net of the reversal of previously recognized OTTI losses on securities sold and losses on securities where price recovery was deemed unlikely (collectively, OTTI reversals) and, in 2006 also excluded merger related costs. FPL Groups management believes adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. 28 In February 2009, the Recovery Act was signed into law. It includes approximately $787 billion in tax incentives and new spending, a portion of which relates to renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy reliability. The Recovery Act includes, among other things, provisions that allow companies building wind facilities the option to choose between three investment cost recovery mechanisms: (i) PTCs which were extended for wind facilities through 2012, (ii) investment tax credits of 30% of the cost for qualifying wind facilities placed in service prior to 2013, or (iii) an election to receive a cash grant of 30% of the cost of qualifying wind facilities placed in service in 2009 or 2010, or if construction began prior to December 31, 2010 and the wind facility is placed in service prior to 2013. An election to receive a cash grant of 30%, in lieu of the 30% investment tax credit allowable under present law, also applies to the cost of qualifying solar facilities placed in service in either 2009 or 2010, or if construction began prior to December 31, 2010 and the solar facility is placed in service prior to 2017. In addition, 50% bonus depreciation was extended on most types of property placed in service in 2009, and certain property placed in service in 2010. FPL Group and FPL are in the process of evaluating the effect of the Recovery Act on their businesses. Results of Operations Summary Presented below is a summary of net income (loss) by reportable segment (see Note 16): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (millions) FPL $ 789 $ 836 $ 802 NextEra Energy Resources 915 540 610 Corporate and Other (65 ) (64 ) (131 ) FPL Group Consolidated $ 1,639 $ 1,312 $ 1,281 The decrease in 2008 in FPLs results reflects lower retail customer usage, higher depreciation and interest expenses and provisions taken in 2008 for regulatory matters, partly offset by a retail base rate increase associated with Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation, lower O&M expenses and higher other revenues and AFUDC equity. FPLs 2007 improved results benefited from a retail base rate increase associated with Turkey Point Unit No. 5 and retail customer growth, partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation and amortization expenses recovered through base rates, a slight decline in retail customer usage and lower interest income on underrecovered fuel and storm costs. Disallowed storm costs, net of certain interest, reduced 2006 net income by approximately $27 million. NextEra Energy Resources 2008 and 2007 results reflect additional earnings from the existing portfolio, from new investments and from full energy and capacity requirements services and trading, partially offset by higher expenses to support the growth in the business. NextEra Energy Resources results in 2007 also reflect higher interest expense and the absence of an approximately $97 million gain ($63 million after tax) recorded in 2006 resulting from a court judgment relating to an Indonesian project that was suspended in 1998. In addition, FPL Groups and NextEra Energy Resources net income for 2008 and 2006 reflects net unrealized after tax gains from non qualifying hedges of $170 million and $92 million, respectively, while 2007 net income reflects net unrealized after tax losses from such hedges of $86 million. The change in unrealized mark to market activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains/losses as the underlying transactions are realized. As a general rule, a gain (loss) in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under generally accepted accounting principles. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, NextEra Energy Resources recorded $82 million, $6 million and $1 million, respectively, of after tax OTTI losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds. In 2008, NextEra Energy Resources had approximately $6 million after tax of OTTI reversals; there were no such OTTI reversals in 2007 or 2006. Results for Corporate and Other in 2008 reflect higher interest expense offset by additional consolidating income tax adjustments. Results for Corporate and Other in 2007 reflect lower interest costs and higher interest income, partly offset by lower federal and state tax benefits. Results for Corporate and Other in 2006 reflect a $98 million ($60 million after tax) impairment charge related to FPL FiberNets metro market assets as a result of significant changes in the business climate in which FPL FiberNet operates and $14 million of after tax merger costs associated with the proposed merger between FPL Group and Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (Constellation Energy), which was terminated in October 2006. See Note 5 Corporate and Other for FPL FiberNet impairment charges and Note 16 for segment information. FPL Groups effective income tax rate for all periods presented reflects PTCs for wind projects at NextEra Energy Resources. PTCs can significantly affect FPL Groups effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income and wind generation. See Note 1 Income Taxes, Note 6 and Note 11 Sale of Differential Membership Interests. 29 FPL FPLs net income for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $789 million, $836 million and $802 million, respectively, a decrease in 2008 of $47 million and an increase in 2007 of $34 million. The decrease in 2008 reflects lower retail customer usage, higher depreciation and interest expenses and provisions taken in 2008 for regulatory matters, partly offset by a retail base rate increase associated with Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation, lower O&M expenses and higher other revenues and AFUDC equity. FPLs 2007 results benefited from a retail base rate increase associated with Turkey Point Unit No. 5 and retail customer growth. These factors were partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation and amortization expenses recovered through base rates, a slight decline in usage per retail customer and lower interest income on underrecovered fuel and storm costs. Disallowed storm costs, net of interest income recorded on 2005 storm restoration costs approved for recovery by the FPSC, reduced FPLs 2006 net income by approximately $27 million. In 2006, when considering FPLs petition to recover 2005 storm costs, the FPSC applied a different standard for recovery of 2005 costs than was used for recovery of the 2004 storm costs. This resulted in certain adjustments and disallowances of storm costs that FPL sought to recover. FPLs current retail base rates were approved by the FPSC in 2005 and are expected to be in effect through December 31, 2009. The 2005 rate agreement provides that retail base rates will not increase during the term of the agreement except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of any power plant approved pursuant to the Siting Act that achieves commercial operation during the term of the 2005 rate agreement. Retail base rates increased in 2007 when Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commenced commercial operation on May 1, 2007. FPL expects that retail base revenues will increase approximately $65 million in 2009 when retail base rates are changed pursuant to the 2005 rate agreement to reflect the placement in service of two West County Energy Center units, which is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2009 and fourth quarter of 2009. The 2005 rate agreement has a revenue sharing mechanism, whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of certain thresholds will be shared with customers on the basis of two thirds refunded to customers and one third retained by FPL. Revenues from retail base operations in excess of a second, higher threshold (cap) will be refunded 100% to customers. The revenue sharing threshold and cap are adjusted each year. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, revenues from retail base operations did not exceed the thresholds for those years and FPL does not expect 2009 revenues to exceed the thresholds. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates for information on the calculation of the threshold and cap and for information on FPLs regulatory ROE. In November 2008, FPL notified the FPSC that it intends to initiate a base rate proceeding in March 2009. In the notification, FPL stated that it expects to request an $800 million to $950 million annual increase in base rates beginning on January 1, 2010 and an additional annual base rate increase beginning on January 1, 2011. These amounts exclude the effects of depreciation, which depend in part on the results of a detailed depreciation study that FPL is currently finalizing. Further, FPL expects to request that the FPSC continue to allow FPL to use the mechanism for recovery of the revenue requirements of any new power plant approved pursuant to the Siting Act that was established in FPLs 2005 rate agreement. Hearings on the base rate proceeding are expected during the third quarter of 2009 and a final decision is expected by the end of 2009. The final decision may approve rates that are different from those that FPL will request. FPLs operating revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (millions) Retail base $ 3,738 $ 3,796 $ 3,657 Fuel cost recovery 6,202 6,162 6,573 Other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs 1,505 1,490 1,588 Other, primarily pole attachment rentals, transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees 204 174 170 Total $ 11,649 $ 11,622 $ 11,988 For the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase in the average number of customers of 0.3% increased retail base revenues by approximately $9 million while a 2.7% decrease in usage per retail customer, reflecting weather conditions and other factors, decreased retail base revenues by approximately $95 million. Partly offsetting the usage decrease was an extra day of sales in 2008, as it was a leap year. In addition, a base rate increase resulting from Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation on May 1, 2007 increased retail base revenues by approximately $28 million. FPL experienced a decline in retail customer growth in the latter half of 2007 and throughout 2008 as well as a decline in non weather related retail customer usage, which FPL believes is reflective of the economic slowdown and housing crisis that has affected the country and the state of Florida. FPL is unable to predict if growth in customers and non weather related customer usage will return to previous trends. For the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase in the average number of customers of 2.0% increased retail base revenues by approximately $71 million. During this period, usage per retail customer decreased 0.4%. This usage decrease, as well as other factors, decreased retail base revenues by approximately $18 million. In addition, the base rate increase resulting from Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation on May 1, 2007 increased 2007 retail base revenues by approximately $86 million. 30 Revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs, such as franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm related surcharges do not significantly affect net income; however, underrecovery or overrecovery of such costs can significantly affect FPL Groups and FPLs operating cash flows. Fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense in the consolidated statements of income, as well as by changes in energy sales. Fluctuations in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs are primarily driven by changes in storm related surcharges, capacity charges, franchise fee costs, the impact of changes in O&M and depreciation expenses on the underlying cost recovery clause, as well as changes in energy sales. Capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. FPL uses a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the FPSC at the programs inception. The FPSC reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs. The program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. The current regulatory asset for the change in fair value of derivative instruments used in the fuel procurement program amounted to approximately $1,109 million and $117 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in fuel revenues in 2008 reflects approximately $230 million related to a higher average fuel factor partly offset by approximately $190 million attributable to lower energy sales. The decrease in fuel revenues in 2007 reflects approximately $484 million related to a lower average fuel factor partly offset by approximately $73 million attributable to higher energy sales. In May 2007, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL issued $652 million aggregate principal amount of storm recovery bonds primarily for the after tax equivalent of the total of FPLs unrecovered balance of 2004 storm restoration costs, the 2005 storm restoration costs and approximately $200 million to reestablish FPLs storm and property insurance reserve. The storm recovery bonds, including interest and bond issuance costs, are being repaid through a surcharge to retail customers. Prior to the issuance of these storm recovery bonds, FPL had been recovering from retail customers, since February 2005, the 2004 storm restoration costs through a storm damage surcharge. Both the revenues from the 2004 storm damage surcharge and the storm recovery bonds surcharge are included in other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs and amounted to approximately $97 million, $94 million and $151 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 9 FPL. Revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs also declined in 2007 due to the absence in 2007 of the recovery of a portion of litigation costs that FPL had been recovering since 2002 through the capacity clause. See discussion below of depreciation and amortization expense. Beginning in 2009, revenues from the nuclear cost recovery rule will be included in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs. The major components of FPLs fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (millions) Fuel and energy charges during the period $ 6,289 $ 6,259 $ 5,662 Net collection of previously deferred retail fuel costs 906 Net deferral of retail fuel costs (55 ) (56 ) Other, primarily capacity charges net of any capacity deferral 515 523 548 Total $ 6,749 $ 6,726 $ 7,116 The increase in fuel and energy charges in 2008 reflects higher fuel and energy prices of approximately $224 million partly offset by approximately $194 million attributable to lower energy sales. The increase in fuel and energy charges in 2007 reflects higher fuel and energy prices of approximately $532 million and approximately $65 million attributable to higher energy sales. At December 31, 2008, approximately $256 million of retail fuel costs were deferred pending collection from retail customers in a subsequent period. The increase from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 in deferred clause and franchise expenses and the decrease in deferred clause and franchise revenues (current and noncurrent, collectively) on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets totaled approximately $110 million and negatively affected FPL Groups and FPLs cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008. 31 FPLs O&M expenses decreased $16 million in 2008 reflecting lower insurance, employee benefit and distribution costs of approximately $47 million, $11 million and $10 million, respectively. These decreases were partly offset by higher nuclear generation, fossil generation, transmission and customer service costs of approximately $21 million, $4 million, $3 million and $20 million, respectively, as well as a reserve for ongoing regulatory matters. The decline in insurance costs was primarily due to the termination by mutual agreement of an environmental insurance policy. The decline in employee benefit costs reflects a higher pension credit as well as lower benefits due to declining market conditions, partly offset by higher medical costs. The decline in distribution costs reflects cost reduction efforts and efficiencies as well as reduced work load due to the decline in customer growth partly offset by severance costs incurred in 2008. The increase in nuclear generation costs reflects plant improvement initiatives to ensure long term reliable operations. The fossil generation increase reflects costs associated with plant maintenance, while the transmission increase reflects additional improvement activities. The customer service cost increase is primarily due to higher uncollectible accounts. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income. Management expects O&M expenses in 2009 to exceed the 2008 level primarily due to the absence of the environmental insurance policy termination as well as higher expected nuclear, fossil generation, transmission, customer service and employee benefit costs. FPLs O&M expenses increased $80 million in 2007 reflecting higher nuclear, fossil generation, distribution, customer service and employee benefits costs of approximately $23 million, $11 million, $11 million, $7 million and $17 million, respectively. The increase in nuclear costs reflects plant improvement initiatives to ensure long term reliable operations while the fossil generation increase reflects costs associated with placing Turkey Point Unit No. 5 in service as well as costs associated with plant repair and a performance payment made to an owner of a jointly owned plant. The distribution increase reflects higher storm preparation costs partly offset by lower new service account costs reflecting a decline in housing starts in FPLs territory. The customer service increase reflects staffing increases related to customer growth and higher uncollectible accounts. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 increased $23 million, reflecting higher depreciation on transmission and distribution facilities (collectively, approximately $20 million) and higher depreciation on fossil generation assets of $10 million, primarily Turkey Point Unit No. 5 which was placed in service in May 2007. In addition, depreciation on nuclear assets was higher by approximately $4 million primarily due to the steam generator and reactor vessel head replacements at St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which were substantially completed by late 2007. The remaining change in 2008 depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the absence of amortization of software and other property that has been fully amortized. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 decreased $14 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2006 included approximately $45 million of amortization of litigation costs that FPL had been recovering through cost recovery clauses over a five year period that began January 1, 2002 and ended December 31, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 reflects higher depreciation on transmission and distribution facilities (approximately $25 million) to support customer growth and demand and depreciation on Turkey Point Unit No. 5 (approximately $18 million). The remaining change in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to lower amortization of software that has been fully amortized. Taxes other than income taxes increased $41 million in 2008, primarily due to changes in franchise fees and revenue taxes, which are pass through costs, and higher property taxes ($15 million), reflecting growth in plant in service balances. The increase in franchise fees was primarily driven by higher average franchise rates. Taxes other than income taxes decreased $13 million in 2007 primarily due to lower franchise fees and revenue taxes reflecting lower retail base and fuel and other cost recovery clause revenues, which are discussed above under the operating revenue table. Taxes other than income taxes in 2007 also reflect lower property taxes of approximately $2 million primarily due to a property tax reduction enacted by the Florida legislature partly offset by higher property taxes due to growth in plant in service balances. Interest expense for 2008 reflects higher average debt balances partly offset by a decline in average interest rates of approximately 34 basis points. Interest expense for 2007 increased primarily due to higher average debt balances. Interest expense on storm recovery bonds, as well as certain other interest expense (collectively, clause interest), are essentially pass through amounts and do not significantly affect net income, as the clause interest is recovered either under cost recovery clause mechanisms or through the storm recovery bond surcharge. Clause interest for 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to approximately $44 million, $32 million and $10 million, respectively. For both 2008 and 2007, higher allowance for borrowed funds used during construction (see AFUDC equity explanation below) partly offset the increase in interest expense. The increase in AFUDC equity for 2008 is primarily attributable to additional AFUDC equity on three natural gas fired combined cycle units of approximately 1,220 mw each at FPLs West County Energy Center in western Palm Beach County, Florida, partly offset by the absence of AFUDC equity on Turkey Point Unit No. 5, which was placed in service in May 2007 and the absence of AFUDC equity on the steam generator and reactor vessel head replacement projects at St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which were substantially completed by late 2007. The increase in AFUDC in 2007 is primarily attributable to additional AFUDC equity on two of the West County Energy Center units, the steam generator and reactor vessel head replacement projects at St. Lucie Unit No. 2 and nuclear spent fuel storage projects, partially offset by lower AFUDC on Turkey Point Unit No. 5. 32 Interest income declined in both 2008 and 2007 reflecting the cessation of interest on FPLs unrecovered balance of the storm reserve deficiency, which balance was collected upon the issuance of the storm recovery bonds in May 2007, partly offset by higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances. FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers. The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale transactions. In 2008, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented less than 4% of FPLs total operating revenues. Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier. Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the retail electric industry in Florida in the near future. If the basis of regulation for some or all of FPLs business changes from cost based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Regulatory Accounting. In 2007, the FPSC denied FPLs need petition for two ultra super critical pulverized coal generating units in Glades County, Florida. In December 2008, the FPSC approved the recovery of approximately $34 million of pre construction costs associated with these units over a five year period beginning January 2010. FPL is currently constructing three natural gas fired combined cycle units of approximately 1,220 mw each at its West County Energy Center, which units are expected to be placed in service by the third quarter of 2009, fourth quarter of 2009 and mid 2011. In addition, FPL is in the process of adding approximately 400 mw of baseload capacity at its existing nuclear units at St. Lucie and Turkey Point, which additional capacity is projected to be placed in service by the end of 2012. In 2008, the FPSC approved FPLs plan to modernize its Cape Canaveral and Riviera power plants to high efficiency natural gas fired units. Each modernized plant is expected to provide approximately 1,200 mw of capacity and be placed in service by 2013 and 2014, respectively. Siting Board approval is pending and is expected in early 2010. In March 2008, the FPSC approved FPLs need petition for two additional nuclear units at its Turkey Point site with projected in service dates between 2018 and 2020, which units are expected in the aggregate to add between 2,200 mw and 3,040 mw of baseload capacity. Additional approvals from other regulatory agencies will be required later in the process. The FPSCs nuclear cost recovery rule provides for the recovery of prudently incurred pre construction costs and carrying charges (equal to the pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through levelized charges under the capacity clause. The same rule provides for the recovery of construction costs, once the new capacity goes into service, through a base rate increase. In October 2008, the FPSC approved FPLs first annual request under the nuclear cost recovery rule for recovery of pre construction costs associated with FPLs planned nuclear units and carrying charges on construction costs associated with the addition of approximately 400 mw of baseload capacity to FPLs existing nuclear units; substantially all of these costs are still subject to a prudence review by the FPSC. In 2008, the FPSC approved eligibility for recovery of prudently incurred costs for FPLs proposed solar generating facilities through the environmental clause. The proposed solar generating facilities are expected to have a capacity totaling 110 mw and to be placed into service by the end of 2010. NextEra Energy Resources NextEra Energy Resources net income for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $915 million, $540 million and $610 million, respectively, an increase in 2008 of $375 million and a decrease in 2007 of $70 million. The primary drivers, on an after tax basis, of these changes were as follows: Increase (Decrease) Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 (millions) New investments (a) $ 155 $ 78 Existing assets (a) 48 117 Full energy and capacity requirements services and trading 6 56 Restructuring activities and asset sales 5 (14 ) Indonesian project gain (63 ) Interest expense, differential membership costs and other (25 ) (61 ) Change in unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity (b) 256 (178 ) Change in OTTI losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds, net of OTTI reversals (70 ) (5 ) Net income increase (decrease) $ 375 $ (70 ) (a) Includes PTCs on wind projects but does not include allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. See Note 1 Income Taxes. Results from new projects are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation. A projects results are included in existing assets beginning with the thirteenth month of operation. (b) For discussion of derivative instruments, see Note 3 and Overview. 33 The increase in NextEra Energy Resources 2008 results from new investments reflects the addition of over 3,200 mw of wind and nuclear generation during or after 2007. The increase in NextEra Energy Resources 2007 results from new investments reflects the addition of over 3,400 mw of wind and nuclear generation during or after 2006. In 2008, results from NextEra Energy Resources existing asset portfolio increased primarily due to favorable market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions and higher wind resource partially offset by the impact of planned and unplanned outages at the Seabrook nuclear facility and lower results from NextEra Energy Resources retail energy provider primarily due to unfavorable commodity margins. Results in 2008 in PJM benefited from a new FERC approved forward capacity market that began in June 2007. In 2007, NextEra Energy Resources existing asset portfolio benefited from improved market conditions in the NEPOOL and ERCOT regions and the absence of a refueling outage at the Seabrook nuclear facility. This was partially offset by lower wind resource, by the effect of the completion, in January 2007, of the amortization of deferred income under a power purchase agreement related to a combined cycle plant in the NEPOOL region and by the reduction in the contracted capacity price at a combined cycle plant in the PJM region. Results in the NEPOOL and PJM regions also benefited from new FERC approved forward capacity markets that began in December 2006 and June 2007, respectively. NextEra Energy Resources 2008 and 2007 financial results benefited from increased gains from its full energy and capacity requirements services and trading activities. Full energy and capacity requirements services include load following services, which require the supplier of energy to vary the quantity delivered based on the load demand needs of the customer, as well as various ancillary services. The increase in 2008 of restructuring activities and asset sales is primarily due to a gain on the sale of development rights on a natural gas project while the decrease in 2007 is primarily due to the absence of a $12 million after tax gain recorded in 2006 on the sale of wind development rights. The decrease in the Indonesian project gain reflects the absence of a $63 million after tax gain ($97 million pretax) recorded by NextEra Energy Resources in 2006 as the result of a court judgment. In both 2008 and 2007, interest expense, differential membership costs and other reflects increased costs due to growth of the business partially offset, in 2008, by certain state income tax benefits. In 2008 and 2006, NextEra Energy Resources recorded after tax net unrealized mark to market gains on non qualifying hedges of approximately $170 million and $92 million, respectively. During 2007, NextEra Energy Resources recorded after tax net unrealized mark to market losses of approximately $86 million. The change in unrealized mark to market activity for 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to decreased forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market losses as the underlying transactions were realized during 2008. The change in unrealized mark to market activity for 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to increased forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains as the underlying transactions were realized during 2007. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, NextEra Energy Resources recorded $82 million, $6 million and $1 million, respectively, of after tax OTTI losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds. In 2008, NextEra Energy Resources had approximately $6 million after tax of OTTI reversals; there were no such OTTI reversals in 2007 or 2006. Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $1,096 million primarily due to gains of $232 million on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity in 2008 compared to losses on such hedges of $342 million in 2007. Excluding this mark to market activity, revenues benefited from project additions, favorable market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions, and favorable wind and hydro resources partially offset by nuclear planned and unplanned outages. NextEra Energy Resources operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $84 million reflecting $342 million of unrealized mark to market losses from non qualifying hedges compared to $496 million of gains on such hedges in 2006. Excluding this mark to market activity, revenues benefited from project additions, favorable market conditions in the NEPOOL and ERCOT regions, the absence of a refueling outage at the Seabrook nuclear facility and increased gains from its full energy and capacity requirements services, partially offset by unfavorable wind resource. NextEra Energy Resources operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $522 million, reflecting $53 million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to $198 million of gains on such hedges in 2007. Excluding these mark to market changes which are reflected in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income, operating expenses increased primarily due to project additions, higher fuel costs and higher corporate general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the business. NextEra Energy Resources operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $50 million, reflecting $198 million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to $318 million of losses on such hedges in 2006. Excluding these mark to market changes, operating expenses increased primarily due to project additions, higher fuel costs and higher corporate general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the business. Equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2008 increased $25 million due to improved market conditions in the PJM region. Equity in earnings of equity method investees decreased $113 million in 2007 primarily due to the absence of the $97 million Indonesian project gain discussed above and due to the effect of the completion, in January 2007, of the amortization of deferred income under a power purchase agreement related to a combined cycle plant in the NEPOOL region, partially offset by unrealized mark to market losses on non qualifying hedges of $26 million in 2006. 34 NextEra Energy Resources interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1 million. Interest expense for 2007 increased $43 million reflecting higher average debt balances to support growth in the business and higher average interest rates. Gains on disposal of assets net in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income for 2008 reflect an approximately $10 million gain on the sale of development rights related to a natural gas project and $8 million of gains on sales of securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds and in 2006 reflect a $20 million gain for the sale of wind development rights. PTCs from NextEra Energy Resources wind projects are reflected in NextEra Energy Resources earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, and amounted to approximately $262 million, $219 million and $167 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In September 2007, NextEra Energy Resources completed the acquisition of Point Beach, a two unit, 1,023 mw nuclear power plant located in Wisconsin from Wisconsin Electric Power Company (We Energies). NextEra Energy Resources purchased the plant, including nuclear fuel, inventory and other items, for a total of approximately $933 million. All of the power from Point Beach is being sold under a long term power purchase contract to We Energies through the current NRC license terms of 2030 for Unit No. 1 and 2033 for Unit No. 2. NextEra Energy Resources is responsible for management and operation of the plant, as well as for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility, and received $390 million of decommissioning funds at closing. NextEra Energy Resources expects its future portfolio capacity growth to come primarily from wind and solar development and from asset acquisitions. NextEra Energy Resources plans to add a total of 7,000 mw to 9,000 mw of new wind generation over the 2008 to 2012 period, of which approximately 1,300 mw were added in 2008. NextEra Energy Resources expects to add approximately 1,100 mw in 2009, of which approximately 480 mw are either under construction or have obtained applicable internal approvals for construction. In addition, NextEra Energy Resources intends to pursue opportunities for new solar generating facilities. The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other things, continued public policy support, which includes, but is not limited to, support for the construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capacity, and access to reasonable capital and credit markets. In July 2008, the PUCT approved a $4.92 billion transmission grid improvement program that would add approximately 2,300 miles of 345 kv lines to deliver wind power from the CREZ in west Texas and the Texas Panhandle to the Dallas/Fort Worth area and other population centers in Texas. In January 2009, Lone Star Transmission, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, was allocated $565 million in projects by the PUCT under the CREZ program. The January 2009 determination is subject to, among other things, reconsideration, appeal and receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals. Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary by geographic region. Revenues from electricity sales in these markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other ancillary services. Some of the factors affecting success in these markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind, solar and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth and exposure to legal and regulatory changes. Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NextEra Energy Resources. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets. NextEra Energy Resources seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants. The combination of new wind projects, expected increase in contribution from existing merchant assets and asset acquisitions are expected to be the key drivers supporting NextEra Energy Resources growth over the next few years. NextEra Energy Resources earnings are subject to variability due to, among other things, operational performance, commodity price exposure, counterparty performance, weather conditions and project restructuring activities. NextEra Energy Resources exposure to commodity price risk is reduced by the degree of contract coverage obtained for 2009 and 2010. Therefore, if NextEra Energy Resources plants do not perform as expected, NextEra Energy Resources could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. NextEra Energy Resources results are affected by fluctuations in weather. In addition to the effect of temperature, which is reflected in commodity prices and demand, changes in weather affect production levels of the wind portfolio as well as the hydro units in Maine and the solar units in California. In managing its exposure to commodity prices, NextEra Energy Resources is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations. NextEra Energy Resources actively manages the trade off between market risk and credit risk, as well as exposure with individual counterparties as a function of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of NextEra Energy Resources 2009 contracted revenues are with investment grade counterparties. 35 Corporate and Other Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of interest expense, the operating results of FPL FiberNet and other business activities as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources based on a deemed capital structure at NextEra Energy Resources of 50% debt for operating projects and 100% debt for projects under construction. For these purposes, the deferred credit associated with differential membership interests sold by a NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary in December 2007 is included with debt. Each subsidiarys income taxes are calculated based on the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or detriments are recorded at Corporate and Other. The major components of Corporate and Others results, on an after tax basis, are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (millions) Interest expense, net of allocations $ (103 ) $ (90 ) $ (97 ) Interest income 22 22 6 FPL FiberNet impairment charges (2 ) (60 ) Merger costs (14 ) Federal and state tax benefits 18 3 30 Other (2 ) 3 4 Net loss $ (65 ) $ (64 ) $ (131 ) The increase in interest expense in 2008 reflects additional debt outstanding partly offset by lower average interest rates of approximately 91 basis points. Interest expense decreased in 2007 primarily due to lower average debt balances. Interest income in 2008 reflects lower interest rates on temporary investments offset by additional earnings on energy related loans made to third parties by FPL Group Capital subsidiaries. In the latter half of 2008, temporary investments were accumulated in response to volatility and disruption in the credit and capital markets while in 2007 temporary investments had been accumulated to purchase Point Beach. Interest income in 2007 reflects earnings on temporary investments accumulated to purchase Point Beach as well as interest recorded on unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." For discussion of FPL FiberNets impairment charges, see Note 5 Corporate and Other. The 2006 merger costs represent costs associated with the proposed merger between FPL Group and Constellation Energy, which was terminated in October 2006. The federal and state tax benefits are primarily due to NextEra Energy Resources growth throughout the United States and other consolidating income tax adjustments. Other includes all other corporate income and expenses, as well as other business activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, to pay maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, to redeem or repurchase outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated funds, borrowings, and the issuance, from time to time, of debt and equity securities, consistent with FPL Groups and FPLs objective of maintaining, on a long term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital access the credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short and long term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements. The global and domestic credit and capital markets have been experiencing unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption. This has significantly affected the cost and available sources of liquidity in the financial markets. FPL and FPL Group Capital have continued to have access to commercial paper and short and long term credit and capital markets. If capital and credit market conditions change, this could alter spending plans at FPL and NextEra Energy Resources. 36 Available Liquidity At December 31, 2008, FPL Groups total net available liquidity was approximately $4.6 billion, of which FPLs portion was approximately $1.6 billion. The components of each companys net available liquidity at December 31, 2008 were as follows: Maturity Date FPL FPL Group Capital FPL Group Consoli dated FPL FPL Group Capital (millions) Bank revolving lines of credit (a) $ 2,500 $ 4,000 $ 6,500 (b) (b) Less letters of credit (545 ) (316 ) (861 ) 1,955 3,684 5,639 Revolving term loan facility 250 250 2011 Less borrowings 250 250 Subtotal 2,205 3,684 5,889 Cash and cash equivalents 120 415 535 Less commercial paper and short term notes payable (773 ) (1,092 ) (1,865 ) Net available liquidity $ 1,552 $ 3,007 $ 4,559 (a) Provide for the issuance of letters of credit up to $6.5 billion ($2.5 billion for FPL) and are available to support FPLs and FPL Group Capitals commercial paper programs and short term borrowings and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies or their subsidiaries operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss), as well as for general corporate purposes. FPLs bank revolving lines of credit are also available to support the purchase of $633 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds (tax exempt bonds) in the event they are tendered by individual bond holders and not remarketed prior to maturity. FPLs and FPL Group Capitals bank revolving lines of credit include commitments of approximately $27 million and $83 million, respectively, from Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman). In September 2008, Lehmans parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of late January 2009, Lehman must receive a notice of non objection from the Office of Thrift Supervision before funding any commercial loan commitment, including this commitment. (b) $17 million of FPLs and $40 million of FPL Group Capitals bank revolving lines of credit expire in 2012. The remaining portion of bank revolving lines of credit for FPL and FPL Group Capital expire in 2013. At February 26, 2009, 38 banks participate in FPLs and FPL Group Capitals credit facilities, with no one bank providing more than 8% of the total in either credit facility. In order for FPL Group Capital to borrow under the terms of its credit facility, FPL Group (which guarantees the payment of FPL Group Capitals credit facility pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement) is required to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL Group Capital credit facility also contains default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL Group to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. Similarly, in order for FPL to borrow under the terms of its credit facility and revolving term loan facility, FPL is required to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL credit facility and revolving term loan facility also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. At December 31, 2008, each of FPL Group and FPL was in compliance with its respective required ratio. In addition, at December 31, 2008, FPL had the capacity to absorb up to approximately $188 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking recovery through a rate adjustment from the FPSC. Also, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources has established a $100 million letter of credit facility which expires in 2017 and serves as security for certain obligations under commodity hedge agreements entered into by the subsidiary. In January 2009, FPL Group entered into an agreement under which FPL Group may offer and sell, from time to time, FPL Group common stock having a gross sales price of up to $400 million. As of February 26, 2009, FPL Group had received proceeds of approximately $40 million through the issuance of common stock under this agreement consisting of 760,000 shares at an average price of $52.10 per share. Shelf Registration In September 2006, FPL Group, FPL Group Capital, FPL and certain affiliated trusts filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective board of directors. As of February 26, 2009, securities that may be issued under the registration statement, as subsequently amended, which became effective upon filing, include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, first mortgage bonds, preferred trust securities, common stock, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, preferred stock and guarantees related to certain of those securities. At February 26, 2009, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital had $3.5 billion (issuable by either or both of them up to such aggregate amount) of board authorized available capacity, and FPL had $900 million of board authorized available capacity. 37 Credit Ratings At February 26, 2009, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital: Moodys (a) S&P (a) Fitch (a) FPL Group: (b) Corporate credit rating A2 A A FPL: (b) Corporate credit rating A1 A A First mortgage bonds Aa3 A AA Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds Aa3/VMIG 1 A A+ Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 FPL Group Capital: (b) Corporate credit rating A2 A A Debentures A2 A A Junior subordinated debentures A3 BBB+ A Commercial paper P 1 A 1 F1 (a) A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. (b) The outlook indicated by each of Moodys, S&P and Fitch is stable. FPL Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities maintained by FPL and FPL Group Capital, the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing upon those credit facilities. Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short term debt issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities, and could result in the requirement that FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, post collateral under certain agreements, including those related to fuel procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding, debt related reserves and trading activities. FPLs and FPL Group Capitals bank revolving lines of credit are available to support these potential requirements. See Available Liquidity above. Cash Flow The changes in cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows: FPL Group FPL Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,403 $ 3,593 $ 2,498 $ 2,180 $ 2,163 $ 1,668 Net cash used in investing activities (5,808 ) (4,578 ) (3,807 ) (2,427 ) (2,214 ) (1,933 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 2,650 655 1,399 304 50 273 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 245 $ (330 ) $ 90 $ 57 $ (1 ) $ 8 FPL Groups cash and cash equivalents increased for the year ended December 31, 2008, reflecting cash generated by operating activities and net issuances of both long and short term debt. These inflows were partially offset by capital investments by FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, the payment of common stock dividends to FPL Group shareholders and the funding of a $500 million loan. FPL Groups cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflect cash generated by net income, the receipt of distributions from equity method investees, the underrecovery by FPL of cost recovery clause costs and an increase in fuel inventory at NextEra Energy Resources. FPL Groups cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflect capital investments, including nuclear fuel purchases, of approximately $2.4 billion by FPL to expand and enhance its electric system and generating facilities to continue to provide reliable service to meet the power needs of present and future customers and investments in independent power projects of approximately $2.8 billion, and the funding of a $500 million loan by an FPL Group Capital subsidiary to a third party for an energy related project. FPL Groups cash flows from investing activities also include amounts related to the purchase and sale of restricted securities held in the special use funds, including the reinvestment of fund earnings and new contributions by NextEra Energy Resources, as well as other investment activity, primarily at FPL Group Capital. 38 During the year ended December 31, 2008, FPL Group generated proceeds from financing activities, net of related issuance costs, of approximately $4.7 billion, including a net increase in short term debt of $848 million (comprised of $917 million increase at FPL Group Capital and $69 million decrease at FPL) and the following long term debt issuances and borrowings: Date Issued Company Debt Issued Interest Rate(s) Principal Amount Maturity Date(s) (millions) January 2008 FPL First mortgage bonds 5.95% $ 600 2038 March 2008 FPL Group Capital Term loans variable 500 2009 2011 June 2008 FPL Group Capital Debentures 5.35% 250 2013 June 2008 FPL Group Capital Debentures variable 250 2011 June 2008 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Canadian dollar denominated term loan variable 153 2011 July 2008 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Limited recourse senior secured notes 7.59% 525 2018 (a) September 2008 FPL Group Capital Term loans variable 320 2011 December 2008 FPL Group Capital Debentures 7 7/8% 500 2015 December 2008 FPL Group Capital Japanese yen denominated term loan variable 141 2011 December 2008 FPL Group Capital Term loan variable 50 2011 December 2008 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Limited recourse senior secured notes 7.5% 202 2013 (a) December 2008 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Limited recourse senior secured notes variable 373 2016 (a) $ 3,864 (a) Partially amortizing with a balloon payment at maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2008, FPL Group paid approximately $2.1 billion in connection with financing activities, including $506 million for FPL Group Capital debt maturities, $327 million for a NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary construction term loan maturity, $200 million for maturing FPL first mortgage bonds, $284 million principal repayments on NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary debt, $41 million principal repayment on FPL subsidiary storm recovery bonds and $714 million for the payment of common stock dividends to FPL Group shareholders. In January 2009, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources borrowed Canadian $94.6 million (US $75.4 million) under a limited recourse senior secured variable rate term loan agreement maturing in 2023 and entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of 2.5775%, plus applicable margin, to limit cash flow exposure. The proceeds from the loan were used to repay a portion of the amount borrowed in June 2008 under the Canadian dollar denominated term loan included in the table above. Also, in January 2009, another indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of 2.68%, plus applicable margin, until 2016 on its $373 million variable rate limited recourse senior secured note that is partially amortizing with a balloon payment due in 2016. This same wholly owned subsidiary entered into a second interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of 3.725%, plus applicable margin, beginning in 2016 to limit the cash flow exposure of refinancing the balloon payment of approximately $124 million due on this note in 2016. Additionally, in January 2009, FPL Group Capital borrowed $72 million under a variable rate term loan agreement maturing in 2011. FPL Groups cash and cash equivalents decreased for the year ended December 31, 2007, reflecting capital investments by FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, the payment of common stock dividends to FPL Group shareholders and an increase in customer receivables. These outflows were partially offset by cash generated by operating activities, net issuances of both long and short term debt, the sale of independent power investments, the return of margin cash collateral from counterparties and a distribution relating to an Indonesian project. FPL Groups cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006 benefited from net issuances of debt, the issuance of common stock and the recovery from customers of previously incurred fuel and storm costs at FPL, which were offset by an increase in FPLs customer receivables and the return of margin cash collateral to counterparties and payment of margin cash collateral to counterparties. The funds generated were used to pay for capital expenditures at FPL, additional investments at NextEra Energy Resources, common stock dividends, storm related costs at FPL and to carry an increase in fossil fuel inventory. 39 Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures FPL Groups and FPLs commitments at December 31, 2008 were as follows: 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (millions) Long term debt, including interest: (a) FPL $ 542 $ 311 $ 312 $ 314 $ 705 $ 9,354 (b) $ 11,538 NextEra Energy Resources 544 549 656 548 582 3,397 6,276 Corporate and Other 1,195 533 1,874 187 430 9,343 13,562 Purchase obligations: FPL (c) 6,270 5,425 4,120 3,360 2,920 7,545 29,640 NextEra Energy Resources (d) 1,760 120 75 75 60 665 2,755 Asset retirement activities: (e) FPL (f) 11,610 11,610 NextEra Energy Resources (g) 1 2 7,247 7,250 Other Commitments: NextEra Energy Resources (h) 69 260 329 Total $ 10,312 $ 6,938 $ 7,037 $ 4,486 $ 4,766 $ 49,421 $ 82,960 (a) Includes principal, interest and interest rate swaps. Variable rate interest was computed using December 31, 2008 rates. (b) Includes $633 million of tax exempt bonds that permit individual bond holders to tender the bonds for purchase at any time prior to maturity. In the event bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL would be required to purchase the tax exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2008, all tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase have been successfully remarketed. FPLs bank revolving lines of credit are available to support the purchase of tax exempt bonds. (c) Represents required capacity and minimum payments under long term purchased power and fuel contracts, the majority of which are recoverable through various cost recovery clauses (see Note 15 Contracts), and projected capital expenditures through 2013. See Note 15 Commitments. (d) Represents firm commitments primarily in connection with the purchase of wind turbines and towers, natural gas transportation, purchase and storage, firm transmission service, nuclear fuel and a portion of its projected capital expenditures. See Note 15 Commitments and Contracts. (e) Represents expected cash payments adjusted for inflation for estimated costs to perform asset retirement activities. (f) At December 31, 2008, FPL had approximately $2,035 million in restricted trust funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPLs nuclear units, which are included in FPL Groups and FPLs special use funds. (g) At December 31, 2008, NextEra Energy Resources 88.23% portion of Seabrooks and 70% portion of Duane Arnolds and its Point Beachs restricted trust funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission its nuclear units totaled approximately $789 million and are included in FPL Groups special use funds. (h) Represents estimated cash distributions related to certain membership interests. See Note 11 Sale of Differential Membership Interests. Guarantees and Letters of Credit FPL Group and FPL obtain letters of credit and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. At December 31, 2008, FPL Group had standby letters of credit of approximately $1.2 billion ($557 million for FPL) and approximately $8.6 billion notional amount of guarantees ($648 million for FPL), of which approximately $6.6 billion ($567 million for FPL) have expirations within the next five years. An aggregate of approximately $861 million of the standby letters of credit at December 31, 2008 were issued under FPLs and FPL Group Capitals credit facilities. See Available Liquidity above. Letters of credit and guarantees support the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities, debt and related reserves, nuclear activities, capital expenditures for wind development, the commercial paper program of FPLs consolidated VIE from which it leases nuclear fuel and other contractual agreements. Each of FPL Group and FPL believe it is unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of credit and guarantees. At December 31, 2008, FPL Group and FPL did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit and guarantees. In addition, FPL Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group Capital, including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees, and FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of NextEra Energy Resources and its subsidiaries. See Note 15 Commitments. Certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have contracts that require certain projects to meet annual minimum generation amounts. Failure to meet the annual minimum generation amounts would result in the NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary becoming liable for liquidated damages. Based on past performance of these and similar projects and current forward prices, management believes that it is unlikely to experience a material exposure as a result of these liquidated damages. Covenants FPL Groups charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of FPL Group to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. During the first quarter of 2008, FPL Group increased its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.41 to $0.445 per share. In February 2009, FPL Group announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.445 to $0.4725 per share. FPL pays dividends to FPL Group in a manner consistent with FPLs long term targeted capital structure. The mortgage securing FPLs first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to FPL Group and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. In light of FPLs current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations. 40 Under the mortgage, in some cases, the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock is restricted. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPLs use of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2008, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage. FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPLs first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior FPL indebtedness. As of December 31, 2008, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 would have been approximately 6.4 times the annual interest requirements and approximately 3.7 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. As of December 31, 2008, FPL could have issued in excess of $6.5 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.5 billion based on retired first mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2008, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes. In September 2006, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (September 2006 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capitals offering of $350 million principal amount of Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 and $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (collectively, Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long term indebtedness (covered debt) of FPL Group Capital (other than the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the September 2006 RCC. The September 2006 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem, and FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2006 RCC. Qualifying securities are securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 180 days prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures. In June 2007, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (June 2007 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capitals offering of $400 million principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series C junior subordinated debentures). The June 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of FPL Group Capital (other than the Series C junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the June 2007 RCC. The June 2007 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (collectively, defease), and FPL Group and any majority owned subsidiary of FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before June 15, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series C junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the June 2007 RCC. In September 2007, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (September 2007 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capitals offering of $250 million principal amount of its Series D Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 and $350 million principal amount of Series E Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (collectively, Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures). The September 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of FPL Group Capital (other than the Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the September 2007 RCC. The September 2007 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem, purchase, or defease, and FPL Group and any majority owned subsidiary of FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures on or before September 1, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2007 RCC. 41 New Accounting Rules and Interpretations Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 03 6 1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities." See Note 12 Earnings Per Share. Accounting for Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 141(R), "Business Combinations." This statement retains the fundamental requirements in FAS 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which FAS 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii) discloses the nature and financial effects of the business combination; and requires restructuring and acquisition related costs to be expensed. FPL Group and FPL are required to adopt FAS 141(R) for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. Accounting for Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51," to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The standard clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. FAS 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. All other requirements of FAS 160 will be applied prospectively. The adoption of FAS 160 on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on FPL Groups or FPLs financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates FPL Groups and FPLs significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Critical accounting policies are those that FPL Group and FPL believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. FPL Group and FPL consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statements: Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities FPL Group and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with long term debt. In addition, FPL Group, through NextEra Energy Resources, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets. NextEra Energy Resources provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Accounting pronouncements, which require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, apply not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market under FAS 133, as amended, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and fuel. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. In general, the models estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. The near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contract. Substantially all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by FPL are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel or capacity clauses. In FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, changes in derivative fair values are recognized in current earnings, unless the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge. For those transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges, much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of common shareholders equity, rather than being recognized in current earnings. For those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges, the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged. 42 Since FAS 133 became effective in 2001, the FASB has discussed and from time to time issued implementation guidance related to FAS 133. In particular, much of the interpretive guidance affects when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from the provisions of FAS 133. Despite the large volume of implementation guidance, FAS 133 and the supplemental guidance do not provide specific guidance on all contract issues. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying FAS 133 and its interpretations. A result of changes in interpretation could be that contracts that currently are excluded from the provisions of FAS 133 would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of income. Certain economic hedging transactions at NextEra Energy Resources do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the statement of income, often resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings. This could be significant to NextEra Energy Resources results because often the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market (such as the physical assets from which power is generated) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. Because of this, FPL Groups management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3 and also see Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits FPL Group sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries. FPL Group also has a supplemental executive retirement plan which includes a non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees. In addition to pension benefits, FPL Group sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits (other benefits plan) for retirees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan. The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance. FPL Group allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria. FPL Group adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," effective December 31, 2006 and the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 effective December 31, 2008. Prior to 2008, FPL Group used a measurement date of September 30. In lieu of remeasuring plan assets and obligations as of January 1, 2008, FPL Group elected to calculate the net periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen month period from September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008 using the September 30, 2007 measurement date. Upon adoption of the measurement date provisions, FPL Group recorded an adjustment to increase 2008 beginning retained earnings by approximately $13 million representing three fifteenths of net periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen month period from September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Included in the adjustment to retained earnings is approximately $1 million related to the reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and approximately $3 million related to the reduction in net regulatory liabilities. Since FPL Group is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, the results of implementing all provisions of FAS 158 are reflected at FPL Group and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations related to the recognition provision of FAS 158 that were estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would have been recorded in AOCI were classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at FPL Group in accordance with regulatory treatment. In addition, adjustments to AOCI as a result of implementing the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 that were estimated to be allocable to FPL were recorded as an adjustment to the previously established regulatory assets and liabilities. FPL Groups income from its pension plan, net of the cost of the other benefits plan, was approximately $86 million, $69 million and $65 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The corresponding amounts allocated to FPL were $60 million, $51 million and $52 million, respectively. Pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all years for the pension plan and 8.00%, 8.00% and 7.75% for the other benefits plan for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, assumed increases in future compensation levels of 4% for all years, and weighted average discount rates of 6.25%, 5.85% and 5.50% for the pension plan and 6.35%, 5.90% and 5.50% for the other benefits plan for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Based on current health care costs (as related to other benefits), the projected 2009 trend assumption used to measure the expected cost of health care benefits covered by the plans for all age groups are 7.0% for medical benefits and 9.0% for prescription drug benefits. These rates are assumed to decrease over the next seven years to the ultimate trend rate of 5.5% and remain at that level thereafter. The ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in 2015 for medical and prescription drug costs. In developing these assumptions, FPL Group evaluated input from its actuaries, as well as information available in the marketplace. For the expected long term rate of return on fund assets, FPL Group considered 10 year and 20 year historical median returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds. FPL Group also considered its funds historical compounded returns. FPL Group believes that 7.75% and 8.00% are reasonable long term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets, respectively. FPL Group will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as necessary. 43 FPL Group bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits plan expense and income only when they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets. The following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant: Decrease in 2008 Net Periodic Benefit Income Change in Assumption FPL Group FPL (millions) Expected long term rate of return (0.5 )% $ 17 $ 12 Discount rate (0.5 )% $ 4 $ 3 Salary increase 0.5 % $ 2 $ 1 Health care cost trend rate (a) 1.0 % $ $ (a) Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits. However, this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in FPL Groups other benefits plan. The fair value of plan assets has decreased from $3.6 billion at September 30, 2007 to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2008 for the pension plan and decreased from $49 million at September 30, 2007 to $29 million at December 31, 2008 for the other benefits plan. Management believes that, based on the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, FPL Group will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. In December 2008, $26 million was transferred from the qualified pension plan as reimbursement for eligible retiree medical expenses paid by FPL Group during the year pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. FPL Group anticipates paying approximately $29 million for eligible retiree medical expenses on behalf of the other benefits plan during 2009 with substantially all of that amount being reimbursed through a transfer of assets from the qualified pension plan. See Note 2. Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets FPL Group evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable as described in FAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Under that standard, an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the assets fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized. In 2006, FPL FiberNet performed an impairment analysis and concluded that an impairment charge related to its metro market assets was necessary. The critical assumptions and estimates used in the analysis include revenue additions, projected capital expenditures and a discount rate. A 10% increase in the revenue growth rate or a 10% decrease in projected capital expenditures would have resulted in no impairment, while a 10% decrease in the revenue growth rate or a 10% increase in projected capital expenditures would increase the impairment charge by less than $5 million. An increase or decrease of 1% in the discount rate would have a corresponding change to the impairment charge of approximately $3 million. See Note 5 Corporate and Other. Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil Dismantlement FPL Group and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and FIN 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations." FAS 143 and FIN 47 require that a liability for the fair value of an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets. See Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 14. 44 For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the FPSC at least every five years. The most recent studies, filed in 2005, indicate that FPLs portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage, is approximately $10.9 billion, or $2.3 billion in 2008 dollars. The studies reflect, among other things, the 20 year license extensions of FPLs nuclear units. At December 31, 2008, $2,332 million was accrued for nuclear decommissioning, of which $1,713 million was recorded as an ARO, $52 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $495 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $176 million was included in accrued asset removal costs (a regulatory liability) on the consolidated balance sheets. FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, fossil dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies, which became effective January 1, 2007, indicated that FPLs portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil units is $707 million. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered AROs. At December 31, 2008, $349 million was accrued for fossil dismantlement costs, of which $26 million was recorded as an ARO, $8 million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $25 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and $306 million was included in accrued asset removal costs (a regulatory liability) on the consolidated balance sheets. NextEra Energy Resources records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs in accordance with FAS 143 and FIN 47 which is determined using various internal and external data. NextEra Energy Resources portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage, is approximately $6.6 billion, or $1.4 billion expressed in 2008 dollars. The liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At December 31, 2008, the ARO for nuclear decommissioning of NextEra Energy Resources nuclear plants totaled approximately $487 million. The calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation under FAS 143 and FIN 47. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, FPL Group and FPL also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, FPL Group and FPL will be required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates would increase FPL Groups and FPLs ARO as of December 31, 2008 by $223 million and $174 million, respectively. Regulatory Accounting FPL follows the accounting practices set forth in FAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." FAS 71 indicates that regulators can create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. If FPL were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of FAS 71 is assessed at each reporting period. 45 FPL Groups and FPLs regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows: FPL Group FPL December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 Regulatory assets: (millions) Current: Deferred clause and franchise expenses $ 248 $ 103 $ 248 $ 103 Securitized storm recovery costs $ 64 $ 59 $ 64 $ 59 Derivatives $ 1,109 $ 117 $ 1,109 $ 117 Pension $ 19 $ $ $ Other $ 4 $ 2 $ $ Noncurrent: Securitized storm recovery costs $ 697 $ 756 $ 697 $ 756 Deferred clause expenses $ 79 $ 121 $ 79 $ 121 Pension $ 100 $ $ $ Unamortized loss on reacquired debt $ 32 $ 36 $ 32 $ 36 Other $ 138 $ 95 $ 133 $ 72 Regulatory liabilities: Current: Deferred clause and franchise revenues $ 11 $ 18 $ 11 $ 18 Pension $ $ 24 $ $ Noncurrent: Accrued asset removal costs $ 2,142 $ 2,098 $ 2,142 $ 2,098 Asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference $ 520 $ 921 $ 520 $ 921 Pension $ $ 696 $ $ Other $ 218 $ 236 $ 218 $ 235 See Note 1 for a discussion of FPL Groups and FPLs other significant accounting policies. Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity Energy Marketing and Trading Certain of FPL Groups subsidiaries, including FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, FPL Group, through NextEra Energy Resources, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets. NextEra Energy Resources provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in energy trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market under FAS 133, as amended, are recorded on FPL Groups and FPLs consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. For FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases and sales are recognized on a net basis in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in FPL Groups consolidated statements of income unless hedge accounting is applied. See Note 3. 46 The changes in the fair value of FPL Groups consolidated subsidiaries energy contract derivative instruments were as follows: Hedges on Owned Assets Trading Non Qualifying OCI FPL Cost Recovery Clauses FPL Group Total (millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 $ 5 $ 8 $ (56 ) $ (921 ) $ (964 ) Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (8 ) (95 ) 39 870 806 Value of contracts purchased/previously not consolidated 23 23 Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI (92 ) (92 ) Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings 3 3 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 5 (77 ) (68 ) (140 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007 2 (138 ) (109 ) (119 ) (364 ) Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts 20 (30 ) 147 (658 ) (521 ) Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI 76 76 Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings 25 25 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 34 286 (331 ) (11 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 56 143 114 (1,108 ) (795 ) Net option premium payments (receipts) (12 ) 18 6 Net margin cash collateral paid (2 ) (2 ) Total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2008 $ 44 $ 159 $ 114 $ (1,108 ) $ (791 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2008 shown above are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows: December 31, 2008 (millions) Current derivative assets $ 433 Noncurrent other assets 192 Current derivative liabilities (1,271 ) Noncurrent derivative liabilities (145 ) FPL Groups total mark to market energy contract net liabilities $ (791 ) The sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at December 31, 2008 were as follows: Maturity 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (millions) Trading: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets $ (38 ) $ (43 ) $ 1 $ (11 ) $ (7 ) $ $ (98 ) Significant other observable inputs (36 ) (29 ) 2 5 1 (57 ) Significant unobservable inputs 148 41 13 2 7 211 Total 74 (31 ) 16 (4 ) 1 56 Owned Assets Non Qualifying: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 7 18 (5 ) (2 ) 18 Significant other observable inputs (7 ) (5 ) (13 ) (12 ) (12 ) (20 ) (69 ) Significant unobservable inputs 158 34 (1 ) 1 2 194 Total 158 47 (19 ) (14 ) (11 ) (18 ) 143 Owned Assets OCI: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 4 14 8 (1 ) 25 Significant other observable inputs 65 21 2 1 89 Significant unobservable inputs Total 69 35 10 114 Owned Assets FPL Cost Recovery Clauses: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Significant other observable inputs (1,108 ) (1,108 ) Significant unobservable inputs (1 ) 1 Total (1,109 ) 1 (1,108 ) Total sources of fair value $ (808 ) $ 52 $ 7 $ (18 ) $ (10 ) $ (18 ) $ (795 ) 47 Market Risk Sensitivity Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of FPL Group and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. In December 2008, FPL Group Capital entered into a cross currency basis swap to hedge against currency movements with respect to both interest and principal payments on a loan; the fair value of the cross currency basis swap was not material at December 31, 2008. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks. With respect to commodities, FPL Groups Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, is responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. FPL Group and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. FPL Group manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees. Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. FPL Groups credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. Commodity price risk FPL Group uses a value at risk (VaR) model to measure market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the VaR figures are as follows: Trading Non Qualifying Hedges and Hedges in OCI and FPL Cost Recovery Clauses (a) Total FPL NextEra Energy Resources FPL Group FPL NextEra Energy Resources FPL Group FPL NextEra Energy Resources FPL Group (millions) December 31, 2007 $ $ 6 $ 6 $ 51 $ 31 $ 37 $ 51 $ 28 $ 39 December 31, 2008 $ $ 5 $ 5 $ 86 $ 54 $ 31 $ 86 $ 58 $ 30 Average for the period ended December 31, 2008 $ $ 4 $ 4 $ 82 $ 50 $ 35 $ 82 $ 48 $ 36 (a) Non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI and FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements. Interest rate risk FPL Group and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and other investments. FPL Group and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate swaps and adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. The following are estimates of the fair value of FPL Groups and FPLs financial instruments: December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (millions) FPL Group: Fixed income securities: Other current assets $ 8 $ 8 (a) $ 3 $ 3 (a) Special use funds $ 1,867 $ 1,867 (a) $ 2,025 $ 2,025 (a) Other investments $ 97 $ 97 (a) $ 108 $ 108 (a) Long term debt, including current maturities $ 15,221 $ 15,152 (b) $ 12,681 $ 12,642 (b) Interest rate swaps net unrealized losses $ (78 ) $ (78 )(c) $ (28 ) $ (28 )(c) FPL: Fixed income securities special use funds $ 1,510 $ 1,510 (a) $ 1,436 $ 1,436 (a) Long term debt, including current maturities $ 5,574 $ 5,652 (b) $ 5,217 $ 5,185 (b) (a) Based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues. (b) Based on market prices provided by external sources. (c) Based on market prices modeled internally. 48 The special use funds of FPL Group and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of FPL Groups and FPLs nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value. At FPL, adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The market value adjustments of FPL Groups non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer term securities, as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin until at least 2014 (2032 at FPL). FPL Group and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to adjust and mitigate interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements. At December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value for FPL Group interest rate swaps was as follows: Notional Amount Effective Date Maturity Date Rate Paid Rate Received Estimated Fair Value (millions) (millions) Fair value hedge FPL Group Capital: $ 300 June 2008 September 2011 Variable (a) 5.625% $ 21 Cash flow hedges NextEra Energy Resources: $ 61 December 2003 December 2017 4.245 % Variable (b) (5 ) $ 20 April 2004 December 2017 3.845 % Variable (b) (1 ) $ 189 December 2005 November 2019 4.905 % Variable (b) (23 ) $ 480 January 2007 January 2022 5.390 % Variable (c) (65 ) $ 160 January 2008 September 2011 3.2050 % Variable (b) (5 ) Total cash flow hedges (99 ) Total interest rate hedges $ (78 ) (a) Three month LIBOR plus 1.18896% (b) Three month LIBOR (c) Six month LIBOR Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near term market change, the net fair value of FPL Groups net liabilities would increase by approximately $671 million ($304 million for FPL) at December 31, 2008. Equity price risk Included in the nuclear decommissioning reserve funds of FPL Group are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $1,080 million and $1,456 million ($648 million and $1,063 million for FPL) at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near term market change, would result in a $108 million ($65 million for FPL) reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL, or adjustments to OCI for FPL Groups non rate regulated operations, at December 31, 2008. Credit risk For all derivative and contractual transactions, FPL Groups energy marketing and trading operations, which includes FPLs energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Relevant considerations when assessing FPL Groups energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include: Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry. Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the United States. Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral. The use of master netting agreements to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. FPL Groups policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties. 49 Based on FPL Groups policies and risk exposures related to credit, FPL Group and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial positions as a result of counterparty nonperformance. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 92% of FPL Groups and 100% of FPLs energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.
