Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. In the discussion of Results of Operations below, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. Overview NextEra Energy is one of the nations largest providers of electricity related services. It has two principal operating subsidiaries, FPL and NextEra Energy Resources. FPL, a rate regulated utility, serves more than 8.7 million people throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida. NextEra Energy Resources, NextEra Energys competitive energy subsidiary, produces electricity primarily using wind, natural gas and nuclear resources. Together, FPLs and NextEra Energy Resources generating assets represented approximately 42,600 mw of capacity at December 31, 2010. See Item 2 Generating Facilities. Corporate and Other, discussed below, includes FPL FiberNet, which provides fiber optic services to FPL, telecommunications companies and other custome rs throughout Florida, and Lone Star, a rate regulated utility in Texas. FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the FPSC through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms. Effective March 1, 2010, pursuant to the FPSC rate order, new retail base rates for FPL were established, resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of approximately $75 million on an annualized basis. The FPSC rate order also established a regulatory ROE of 10.0% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points and an adjusted regulatory equity ratio of 59.1%, and shifted certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity clause. In addition, the FPSC rate order directed FPL to reduce depreciation expense (surplus depreciation credit) over the 2010 to 2013 period related to a depreciation reserve surplus of app roximately $895 million. Subsequently, the principal parties in FPLs 2009 rate case signed the 2010 rate agreement and, on February 1, 2011, the FPSC issued a final order reflecting its decision to approve the 2010 rate agreement. Key elements of the 2010 rate agreement, which will be effective through December 31, 2012, are as follows: Subject to the provisions of the 2010 rate agreement, retail base rates will be effectively frozen through the end of 2012. Incremental cost recovery through FPLs capacity clause for WCEC Unit No. 3, which is expected to be placed in service by mid 2011, will be permitted up to the amount of the projected fuel savings for customers during the term of the 2010 rate agreement. See Item 1 FPL Operations Fossil Operations. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an accelerated basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kwh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge for the amount above $800 million. If FPLs earned regulatory ROE falls below 9%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If FPLs earned regulatory ROE rises above 11%, any party to the 2010 rate agreement may seek a reduction in FPLs retail base rates. In determining the regulatory ROE for all purposes under the 2010 rate agreement, earnings will be calculated on an actual, non weather adjusted basis. FPL can vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in 2010 of $267 million, a cap in subsequent years of $267 million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years, and a cap of $776 million (surplus depreciation credit cap) over the course of the 2010 rate agreement, provided that in any year of the 2010 rate agreement, including 2010, FPL must use at least enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain a 9% earned regulatory ROE but may not use any amount of surplus depreciation credit that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11%. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $772 million of the surplus depreciation credit cap remains. NextEra Energys and FPLs financial statements in Item 8 reflect the effects of the FPSC rate order and the 2010 rate agreement. Under the terms of the 2005 rate agreement, which was in effect from January 1, 2006 through February 28, 2010, retail base rates did not increase except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of FPLs three power plants that achieved commercial operation during the term of the 2005 rate agreement: Turkey Point Unit No. 5 in 2007 and WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2 in 2009. Under the terms of the 2005 rate agreement, FPLs electric property depreciation rates were based upon the comprehensive depreciation studies it filed with the FPSC in March 2005; however, FPL reduced depreciation on its plant in service by $125 million each year as allowed by the 2005 rate agreement. The 2005 rate agreement also provided for a revenue sharing mechanism, whereby revenues from retail base ope rations in excess of certain thresholds would be shared with customers. During the term of the 2005 rate agreement, FPLs revenues did not exceed the thresholds. 34 In 2010, FPLs retail customer growth was 0.5%, compared to a 0.2% decline in customers in 2009 and a 0.3% increase in 2008. Positive customer growth is projected to continue in 2011, although the rate of growth is projected to be below FPLs average rate of 1.6% over the last 10 years. Non weather related usage per retail customer began to decline in the mid 2000s and this decline intensified in the 2007 to 2009 period. The rate of decline in non weather related usage per retail customer moderated in 2010. Inactive accounts (accounts with installed meters without corresponding customer names) and low usage customers (customers using less than 200 kwh per month) began to increase in 2007 and peaked in 2009. At December 31, 2010, inactive accounts were approximately 6.0% less than they had been at December 31, 2009 while the number of low usage customers was 2.5% higher than they were at December 31, 2009. FPL believes that the economic slowdown and the downturn in the housing market that have affected the country and the state of Florida have contributed to the slowdown in customer growth and to the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer. A portion of the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer may also be related to federal and state mandated energy efficiency measures. The unemployment rate in Florida was 12.0% and 11.7% in December 2010 and 2009, respectively, and was as high as 12.3% in early 2010. FPL is unable to predict whether or when growth in customers and non weather related customer usage might return to previous trends. NextEra Energy Resources is in the competitive energy business with the majority of its operating revenues derived from wholesale electricity sales. NextEra Energy Resources strategy is, among other things, to continue to maintain its leadership position in wind, accelerate growth in solar development, continue to expand its transmission capability, grow its customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses, and develop its natural gas infrastructure business. NextEra Energy Resources customer supply business includes full energy and capacity requirements services and the operations of a retail electricity provider. NextEra Energy Resources seeks to expand its generation portfolio primarily through wind and solar development and acquisitions where economic prospects are attractive.&#16 0; NextEra Energy Resources plans to add approximately 3,500 mw to 5,000 mw of new wind generation in 2010 to 2014, including 754 mw added in 2010 and approximately 700 mw to 1,000 mw in 2011. In addition to wind expansion, NextEra Energy Resources is considering several solar development opportunities in the United States and Europe, and plans to add approximately 400 mw to 600 mw of new solar generation in 2010 through 2014, including 5 mw added in 2010. The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other things, continued public policy support, support for the construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capacity, continued market demand, supply chain expansion and access to capital at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms. NextEra Energy Resources continues to invest in natural gas infrastructure opportunities. NextEra Energy Resources is evaluating additional natural gas infrastructure opportunities and will continue to explore additional projects as opportunities that it believes will be economically attractive become available. NextEra Energy Resources market is diversified by region as well as by fuel source. See Item 2 Generating Facilities. NextEra Energy Resources sells a large percentage of its expected output to hedge against price volatility. Consequently, if NextEra Energy Resources plants do not perform as expected, NextEra Energy Resources could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. NextEra Energy Resources energy marketing and trading business is focused primarily on managing commodity price risk and extracting maximum value from its assets. The U.S. Congress, the EPA and certain states and regions continue to consider several legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to GHG emissions. The economic and operational impact of any legislation and or regulation on NextEra Energy and FPL depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the allowed emissions, whether emission allowances will be allocated or auctioned, the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance. If and until legislation is enacted and implementing regulations are adopted, the economic and operational impact (either positive or negative) on NextEra Energy and FPL cannot be determined, but could be material. In the case of FPL, increased costs ass ociated with compliance with new environmental regulations are generally recoverable from customers, while the recovery of such increased costs for NextEra Energy Resources would depend on market prices for electricity. See Item 1 Environmental Matters. Results of Operations NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Resources segregate into two categories unrealized mark to market gains and losses on energy derivative transactions which are used to manage commodity price risk. The first category, referred to as trading activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts. The second category, referred to as non qualifying hedges, represents the net unrealized effect of derivative and certain other transactions entered into as economic hedges but which do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting was not elected, and the ineffective portion of transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges. In January 2010, NextEra Energy discontinued hedge accounting for its cash flow hedges related to energy contract derivative instruments, which could result in increased volatility in the non qualifying hedge category. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. See Note 3. 35 NextEra Energys management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings) internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance based compensation under NextEra Energys employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to investors. Adjusted earnings exclude the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges and other than temporary impairment (OTTI) losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds, net of the reversal of previously recognized OTTI losses on securities sold and losses on securities where price recovery was deemed unlikely (collectively, OTTI reversals). NextEra Energys management believes adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Summary Presented below is a summary of net income by reportable segment (see Note 15). Beginning in 2010, NextEra Energy Resources results reflect an allocation of interest expense from Capital Holdings to NextEra Energy Resources based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and allocated shared service costs. NextEra Energys other reportable segment, FPL, a rate regulated utility, was not affected by these changes. Prior year segment data of NextEra Energy Resources and Corporate and Other has been restated to include the effect of these changes. Corporate and Other represents other business activities, other segments that are not separately reportable and eliminating entries. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) FPL $ 945 $ 831 $ 789 NextEra Energy Resources 980 759 831 Corporate and Other 32 25 19 NextEra Energy Consolidated $ 1,957 $ 1,615 $ 1,639 The increase in FPLs 2010 results reflects higher retail customer usage of 1.7%, retail base rate increases resulting from the placement in service of WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2 in 2009, the impact of the FPSC rate order and higher cost recovery clause results, partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense recovered through base rates, higher O&M, property tax and interest expenses and lower AFUDC equity. The increase compared to the prior year period in retail customer usage reflects colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters, and other factors, partly offset by lower usage in the fourth quarter. FPLs 2009 results reflects retail base rate increases resulting from the placement in service of WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, higher AFUDC equity on the WCEC units, a 0.3% increase in usage per retail customer reflecting favorable weather conditions partly offset by other factors, and higher cost recovery clause results partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation and amortization expenses recovered through base rates. NextEra Energy Resources results for 2010 and 2009 were affected by net unrealized after tax gains and losses from non qualifying hedges, after tax OTTI losses on securities held in its nuclear decommissioning funds and after tax OTTI reversals. See table below for details of such gains, losses and reversals, all of which are included in NextEra Energys and NextEra Energy Resources net income. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Net unrealized mark to market after tax gains (losses) from non qualifying hedge activity $ 176 $ (20 ) $ 170 OTTI after tax losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds $ (9 ) $ (36 ) $ (82 ) OTTI after tax reversals $ 13 $ 23 $ 6 The change in unrealized mark to market activity from non qualifying hedges is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized. As a general rule, a gain (loss) in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under generally accepted accounting principles. 36 NextEra Energy Resources results for 2010 also reflect higher earnings from the existing asset portfolio, earnings from new investments and higher gas infrastructure results. These results were partially offset by lower results from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses, the absence of a tax benefit recorded in 2009 reflecting the reduction of previously deferred income taxes resulting from an additional equity investment in Canadian operations (foreign tax benefit), the absence of a tax benefit recorded in 2009 related to a change in state tax law that extended the carry forward period of ITCs on certain wind projects (state tax benefit), a writedown of the value of certain assets associated with plans to repower two California wind facilities and higher expenses to support the growth of the business. NextEra Energy Resources 2009 results also reflect increased earnings from new investments and the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the existing asset portfolio, reflecting the negative impacts of weather and higher expenses to support the growth in the business. See footnote (a) to the table under NextEra Energy Resources below for a description of projects included in new investments and the existing asset portfolio. Results for Corporate and Other in 2010 reflect higher consolidating income tax benefits, including a one time benefit of $24 million related to deferred income taxes, and higher interest income, partly offset by higher interest expense. Results for Corporate and Other in 2009 reflect higher interest income and realized and unrealized gains on investments, partly offset by lower consolidating income tax adjustments and higher interest expense. NextEra Energys effective income tax rate for all periods presented reflects PTCs for wind projects at NextEra Energy Resources and, for 2010 and 2009, deferred tax benefits associated with grants (convertible ITCs) under the Recovery Act. PTCs and deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs can significantly affect NextEra Energys effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income. PTCs can be significantly affected by wind generation. See Note 1 Income Taxes and Sale of Differential Membership Interests and Note 6. FPL FPLs net income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $945 million, $831 million and $789 million, respectively, an increase in 2010 of $114 million and an increase in 2009 of $42 million. See Summary above for a discussion of the major drivers of these increases. See Overview for a discussion of FPSC rate matters. FPLs operating revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Retail base $ 4,190 $ 3,828 $ 3,738 Fuel cost recovery 4,090 5,982 6,202 Net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues 356 Net deferral of retail fuel revenues (356 ) Other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs, net of any deferrals 1,638 1,840 1,505 Other, primarily pole attachment rentals, transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees 211 197 204 Total $ 10,485 $ 11,491 $ 11,649 For the year ended December 31, 2010, a 0.5% increase in the average number of customer accounts increased retail base revenues by approximately $19 million, while a 1.7% increase in usage per retail customer, reflecting cold weather experienced in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters and other factors partly offset by lower usage in the fourth quarter, increased retail base revenues by approximately $79 million. Base rate increases resulting from two WCEC units commencing commercial operation in August and November 2009 and the base rate increase pursuant to the FPSC rate order increased retail base revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 by approximately $196 million and $68 million, respectively. See Overview for a discussion of FPLs customer growth and non wea ther related usage. For the year ended December 31, 2009, a 0.2% decrease in the average number of customer accounts reduced retail base revenues by approximately $8 million while a 0.3% increase in usage per retail customer, reflecting favorable weather conditions partly offset by other factors, increased retail base revenues by approximately $30 million. Customer usage in 2009 reflects one less day of sales in 2009, as 2008 was a leap year. Base rate increases resulting from the two WCEC units commencing commercial operation in 2009 increased retail base revenues by approximately $68 million. 37 Revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs, such as franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm related surcharges, are largely a pass through of costs. Such revenues also include a return allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets, primarily related to solar, environmental and nuclear capacity projects. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, cost recovery clauses contributed $75 million, $41 million and $25 million, respectively, to FPLs net income. The increase in 2010 and 2009 cost recovery clause results is primarily due to a return related to additional solar, environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures, partly offset in 2009 by lower interest earned on fuel clause underrecoveries. In 2011, it is expected that cost recovery clauses will contribute higher earnings for FPL as a result of additional nuclear capacity and environmental expenditures. Underrecovery or overrecovery of such cost recovery clause and pass through costs can significantly affect NextEra Energys and FPLs operating cash flows. Fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense in the consolidated statements of income, as well as by changes in energy sales. Fluctuations in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs are primarily driven by changes in storm related surcharges, capacity charges, franchise fee costs, the impact of changes in O&M and depreciation expenses on the underlying cost recovery clause, investment in solar and environmental projects, investment in nuclear capacity until such capacity goes into service, pre construction costs associated with the development of two additional n uclear units at the Turkey Point site and changes in energy sales. Capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes and other, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. FPL uses a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the FPSC. The FPSC reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs. The program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. The current regulatory asset for the change in fair value of derivative instruments used in the fuel procurement program amounted to approximately $236 million and $68 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Pursuant to an FPSC order, FPL was required to refund in the form of a one time credit to retail customers bills the 2009 year end estimated fuel overrecovery; during the first quarter of 2010, approximately $404 million was refunded to re tail customers. At December 31, 2009, approximately $356 million of retail fuel revenues were overrecovered, the reversal of which is reflected in the net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues caption included in the table above. The difference between the refund and the December 31, 2009 overrecovery will be collected from retail customers after 2010. The decrease in fuel revenues in 2010 reflects the $404 million refund and approximately $1,573 million related to a lower average fuel factor, partly offset by $85 million attributable to higher energy sales. The decrease in fuel revenues in 2009 reflects approximately $210 million related to a lower average fuel factor and $10 million attributable to lower energy sales. The decrease from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 in deferred clause and franchise revenues and the increase in deferred clause and franchise expenses (current and noncurrent, collectively) on Ne xtEra Energys and FPLs consolidated balance sheets totaled approximately $629 million and negatively affected NextEra Energys and FPLs cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs in 2010 is primarily due to lower revenues associated with the FPSCs nuclear cost recovery rule and lower revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes, partly offset by higher environmental clause revenues. The increase in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs in 2009 is primarily due to additional revenues associated with the FPSCs nuclear cost recovery rule and higher conservation and environmental clause revenues. The FPSCs nuclear cost recovery rule provides for the recovery of prudently incurred pre construction costs and carrying charges (equal to a pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through levelized charges under the capacity clause. In 2009, FPL began recovering pre construction costs associated with the development of two additional nuclear units at the Turkey Point site and carrying charges (equal to a pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs associated with the addition of approximately 400 mw to 460 mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units. The same rule provides for the recovery of construction costs, once property related to the new nuclear capacity goes into service, through a base rate increase. The decline in 2010 in revenues associated with the nuclear cost recovery rule is primarily due to lower spending related to the development of the two additional nuclear units at the Turkey Point site. The decline in 2010 revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes reflects the decline in fuel revenues. The major components of FPLs fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Fuel and energy charges during the period $ 4,714 $ 5,425 $ 6,289 Net collection of previously deferred retail fuel costs 256 Net deferral of retail fuel costs (276 ) (55 ) Other, primarily capacity charges, net of any capacity deferral 544 539 515 Total $ 4,982 $ 6,220 $ 6,749 The decrease in fuel and energy charges in 2010 reflects lower fuel and energy prices of approximately $822 million, partly offset by approximately $111 million attributable to higher energy sales. The decrease in fuel and energy charges in 2009 was due to lower fuel and energy prices. 38 FPLs O&M expenses increased $124 million in 2010 reflecting an approximately $20 million charge for workforce reductions and higher nuclear and fossil generation, distribution, transmission and nuclear insurance costs of approximately $34 million, $29 million, $16 million, $8 million and $12 million, respectively, partly offset by lower customer service costs, primarily due to lower uncollectible accounts, of $13 million. The increase in nuclear generation costs is primarily due to higher maintenance costs and reflects a reimbursement in 2009 of prior years costs of approximately $10 million related to a spent nuclear fuel litigation settlement agreement with the U.S. Government. The increase in fossil generation costs is primarily related to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, which units were placed in se rvice in the second half of 2009, and higher plant overhaul costs. The increase in distribution and transmission costs reflects higher restoration and tree trimming costs. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income. FPLs O&M expenses increased $58 million in 2009 reflecting higher insurance and employee benefit costs of approximately $51 million and $44 million, respectively, partly offset by lower distribution, nuclear and fossil generation costs of $26 million, $18 million and $10 million, respectively. The increase in insurance costs is primarily due to the absence of a refund associated with an environmental insurance policy termination, which occurred in 2008, as well as higher nuclear insurance costs. The increase in employee benefit costs is primarily due to higher medical costs, a lower pension credit and other costs driven by market conditions. The decrease in distribution costs reflects deferred projects and productivity improvements. The decline in nuclear generation costs reflects a rei mbursement of prior years costs related to the spent fuel settlement agreement and lower costs related to 2008 plant improvement initiatives partly offset by higher refueling and maintenance outage costs. The decline in fossil generation costs is primarily due to lower overhaul costs, partly offset by additional costs related to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income. The major components of FPLs depreciation and amortization expense are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) $125 million annual reduction under the 2005 rate agreement $ $ (125 ) $ (125 ) Surplus depreciation credit recorded under the 2010 rate agreement (4 ) Other depreciation and amortization recovered under base rates 891 942 908 Depreciation and amortization recovered under cost recovery clauses 121 280 77 Total $ 1,008 $ 1,097 $ 860 FPL had been recording the $125 million annual reduction in depreciation and amortization expense since 2002, as approved by the FPSC in previous rate orders. See Overview regarding the amount of surplus depreciation credit that FPL may record over the term of the 2010 rate agreement. The decline in other depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in 2010 is primarily due to lower depreciation rates as a result of the FPSC rate order, partly offset by higher plant in service balances related to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, which were placed in service in August and November 2009, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in 2009 is primarily due to higher depreciation on transmission and distribution facilities, as well as WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2. Depreciation and amortization recorded under cost recovery clauses in 2010 and 2009 reflects changes in the amortization of pre construction costs associated with FPLs planned nuclear units recovered under the nuclear cost recovery rule. See Note 1 Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization. Taxes other than income taxes and other decreased $71 million in 2010 and increased $24 million in 2009 primarily due to changes in franchise fees and revenue taxes, which are pass through costs. In addition, taxes other than income taxes and other in 2010 and 2009 reflect higher property taxes of $34 million and $14 million, respectively, due to growth in plant in service balances and, for 2010, a higher property tax rate. The increase in interest expense in 2010 is primarily due to higher average debt balances, as well as lower AFUDC debt. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 reflects a decline in average interest rates of approximately 29 basis points and higher AFUDC debt, partly offset by higher average debt balances. See AFUDC equity below for explanation of the change in AFUDC debt. Interest expense on storm recovery bonds, as well as certain other interest expense (collectively, clause interest), are essentially pass through amounts and do not significantly affect net income, as the clause interest is recovered either under cost recovery clause mechanisms or through a storm recovery bond surcharge. Clause interest for 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to approximately $56 million, $45 millio n and $44 million, respectively. The increase in clause interest in 2010 is primarily due to higher interest associated with solar, environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures. The decrease in AFUDC equity in 2010 is primarily attributable to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, which units commenced commercial operation in 2009, partly offset by additional AFUDC equity on WCEC Unit No. 3. The decrease in AFUDC equity also reflects a decline, effective April 1, 2010, in the AFUDC rate from 7.41% to 6.41%, as approved by the FPSC. The increase in AFUDC equity in 2009 is primarily attributable to additional AFUDC equity on WCEC Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3. 39 FPL currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups, primarily industrial customers. The FERC has jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale transactions. In 2010, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 3% of FPLs total operating revenues. Various states, other than Florida, have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier. Management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the retail electric industry in Florida in the near future. If the basis of regulation for some or all of FPLs business changes from cost based regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Regulatory Accounting. FPL is currently constructing WCEC Unit No. 3, a natural gas fired combined cycle unit of approximately 1,220 mw, which is expected to be placed in service by mid 2011. In addition, FPL is in the process of adding approximately 400 mw to 460 mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units at St. Lucie and Turkey Point, which additional capacity is projected to be placed in service from spring 2011 to 2013. FPL is also in the process of modernizing its Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants to high efficiency natural gas fired units and expects the units to be placed in service by 2013 and 2014, respectively. Each modernized plant is expected to provide approximately 1,200 mw of capacity. A 10 mw solar PV facility in Brevard County, Florida was placed in service in April 2010 and a 75 mw solar thermal facility in Martin County, Florida was placed in service in December 2010. NextEra Energy Resources NextEra Energy Resources 2009 and 2008 segment results have been restated to reflect a change in the method of allocating non utility interest expense and the allocation of shared service costs. See Summary above and Note 15 for additional discussion. NextEra Energy Resources net income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $980 million, $759 million and $831 million, respectively, an increase in 2010 of $221 million and a decrease in 2009 of $72 million. The primary drivers, on an after tax basis, of these changes were as follows: Increase (Decrease) From Prior Period Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (millions) New investments(a) $ 45 $ 173 Existing assets(a) 54 (213 ) Gas infrastructure 23 3 Customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses (25 ) 120 Asset sales 7 6 Interest expense, differential membership costs and other (96 ) (34 ) Change in unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity(b)(c) 196 (190 ) Change in OTTI losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds, net of OTTI reversals(c) 17 63 Net income increase (decrease) $ 221 $ (72 ) (a) Includes PTCs and ITCs on wind projects and ITCs on solar projects and, for new investments, deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs (see Note 1 Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, Note 1 Income Taxes and Note 6) but does not include allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. Results from new projects are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation. A projects results are included in existing assets beginning with the thirteenth month of operation. (b) See Note 3 and discussion above related to derivative instruments. (c) See table in Summary above for additional detail. The increase in NextEra Energy Resources 2010 results from new investments reflects the addition of over 2,100 mw of wind generation during or after 2009 and a benefit related to state ITCs. The increase in NextEra Energy Resources 2009 results from new investments reflects the addition of over 2,490 mw of wind generation during or after 2008. Results from new investments for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 include approximately $66 million and $87 million, respectively, of deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs. In 2010, results from NextEra Energy Resources existing asset portfolio increased primarily due to favorable results at Seabrook of approximately $62 million resulting primarily from the absence of an extended outage in 2010. In addition, 2010 results from the existing asset portfolio reflects favorable generation due to lower curtailments and a higher wind resource across the wind portfolio totaling approximately $46 million. These results were partially offset by unfavorable market conditions in the ERCOT market affecting NextEra Energy Resources merchant gas assets totaling approximately $30 million and the absence of the state tax benefit of $15 million. In 2009, results from NextEra Energy Resources existing asset portfolio decreased approximately $110 million primarily due to unfavorable resul ts in the ERCOT and NEPOOL markets due primarily to unfavorable market conditions, lower results of $75 million associated with existing wind projects primarily due to a lower wind resource across the portfolio and lower results of $36 million from the contracted portfolio, partly offset by the state tax benefit and favorable results at Seabrook primarily due to higher prices. The increase in gas infrastructure results in 2010 is primarily due to exiting the hedged positions on a small number of future drilling opportunities. 40 Results from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower power and gas trading results, partly offset by a gain from the sale of a power supply contract that NextEra Energy Resources entered into in 2009. The increase in 2009 is due to higher power and gas trading results and favorable residential sales margins from the retail electricity provider. Asset sales in 2010 include an after tax gain of approximately $6 million on the sale of a coal fired project and an after tax gain on a waste to energy project of approximately $12 million recorded in 2010 after the expiration of an option for the buyer to sell the project back to NextEra Energy Resources. Asset sales in 2009 include after tax gains of $3 million for the sale of wind development rights, $6 million for the sale of a 50 mw wind project and $2 million for the sale of an interest in the waste to energy project while asset sales in 2008 reflect a $6 million after tax gain on the sale of development rights on a natural gas project. In both 2010 and 2009, interest expense, differential membership costs and other reflects higher interest and other costs due to growth of the business and, for 2010, also reflects an after tax writedown of approximately $11 million in the value of certain assets associated with the plans to repower two California wind facilities and the absence of the foreign tax benefit of $18 million which was recorded in 2009. In 2009, the foreign tax benefit was offset by other income tax expenses in 2009 and the absence of other income tax benefits recorded in the prior year. Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $639 million primarily due to higher revenues at PMI and NextEra Energy Resources retail electricity provider (collectively, approximately $242 million), project additions ($143 million), higher gas infrastructure revenues of $31 million, higher revenues in the existing asset portfolio of $206 million primarily due to the absence of an extended outage in 2010 at Seabrook, favorable generation due to lower curtailments and a higher wind resource across the wind portfolio. In addition, operating revenues increased due to losses of $75 million on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity compared to $88 million of such losses in 2009. Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $573 million primarily due to losses of $88 million on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity in 2009 compared to gains on such hedges of $232 million in 2008. Excluding this mark to market activity, revenues were affected by unfavorable market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM markets and an unfavorable wind resource, partly offset by higher operating revenues at PMI and NextEra Energy Resources retail electricity provider (collectively, approximately $384 million) and project additions ($131 million). Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $262 million reflecting higher fuel costs of approximately $366 million, higher costs for project additions of approximately $85 million and higher other operating expenses of $130 million. Other operating expenses increased due to higher maintenance activities, a write down in the value of certain assets associated with the plans to repower two California wind facilities and additional wells in gas infrastructure. This was partially offset by $364 million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to $60 million of such gains in 2009. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $281 million primarily due to lower fuel costs of approximately $390 million partially offset by proj ect additions of $94 million and higher corporate general and administrative expenses of $21 million to support the growth in the business. In addition, operating expenses reflect $60 million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to $53 million of such gains in 2008. NextEra Energy Resources interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 increased $55 million and $42 million, respectively, primarily due to increased borrowings to support the growth of the business, partly offset by lower average interest rates of approximately 36 basis points and 37 basis points, respectively. Gains on disposal of assets net in NextEra Energys consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 reflect $49 million, $56 million and $8 million, respectively, of gains on sales of securities held in NextEra Energy Resources nuclear decommissioning funds. In addition, gains on disposal of assets net for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflect a pretax gain of $18 million on the sale of the waste to energy proje ct and for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflect an approximately $10 million pretax gain on the sale of development rights related to a natural gas project. PTCs from NextEra Energy Resources wind projects are reflected in NextEra Energy Resources earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, and were approximately $307 million, $255 million and $262 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, NextEra Energys effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was affected by deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs of $68 million and $88 million, respectively. See Note 6. 41 NextEra Energy Resources expects its future portfolio capacity growth to come primarily from wind and solar development and from asset acquisitions. NextEra Energy Resources plans to add approximately 3,500 mw to 5,000 mw of new wind generation in 2010 to 2014, including 754 mw added in 2010 and approximately 700 mw to 1,000 mw in 2011. In addition to wind expansion, NextEra Energy Resources is considering several solar development opportunities in the United States and Europe, and plans to add approximately 400 mw to 600 mw of new solar generation during the period 2010 through 2014, including 5 mw added in 2010. The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other things, continued public policy support, support for the construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capa city, continued market demand, supply chain expansion and access to capital at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms. Currently, in the United States, approximately 30 states and the District of Columbia have RPS requiring electricity providers in the state or district to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources. These standards vary, but the majority include requirements to meet 10% to 25% of the electricity providers retail sales with energy from renewable sources by 2025. NextEra Energy Resources believes that these standards will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future. Competitive wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary among and within geographic regions. Revenues from electricity sales in these markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other ancillary services. Some of the factors affecting success in these markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind, solar and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from regulated utilities and new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth, level of demand, environmental requirements and exposure to legal and regulatory changes. Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NextEra Energy Resources. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets. NextEra Energy Resources seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants. The combination of new wind and solar projects and asset acquisitions are expected to be the key drivers supporting NextEra Energy Resources growth over the next few years. NextEra Energy Resources earnings are subject to variability due to, among other things, operational performance, commodity price exposure, counterparty performance, weather conditions and project restructuring activities. NextEra Energy Resources exposure to commodity price risk is reduced by the degree of contract coverage obtained for 2011 and 2012. Therefore, if NextEra Energy Resources plants do not perform as expected, NextEra Energy Resources could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations. In addition to the effect of temperature, which is reflected in commodity prices and demand, changes in weather affect production levels of the wind portfolio as well as the hydro and solar units. In managing its expos ure to commodity prices, NextEra Energy Resources is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations. NextEra Energy Resources actively manages the trade off between market risk and credit risk, as well as exposure with individual counterparties as a function of their creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2010, substantially all of NextEra Energy Resources 2011 contracted revenues are with investment grade counterparties. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of interest expense, the operating results of FPL FiberNet and other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates non utility interest expense and shared service costs to NextEra Energy Resources. See Summary above and Note 15 for a discussion regarding a change, beginning in 2010, in the method of allocating non utility interest expense, the allocation of shared service costs and the restatement of the prior year segment results of Corporate and Other. For purposes of allocating non utility interest expense, the deferred credit associated with differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources subsid iaries is included with debt. Each subsidiarys income taxes are calculated based on the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at Corporate and Other. The major components of Corporate and Others results, on an after tax basis, are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Interest expense, net of allocations to NextEra Energy Resources $ (63 ) $ (43 ) $ (38 ) Interest income 43 34 22 Federal and state income tax benefits 35 18 Other 17 34 17 Net income $ 32 $ 25 $ 19 42 The increase in interest expense in 2010 and 2009 reflects additional debt outstanding, partly offset by lower average interest rates of approximately 40 basis points and 66 basis points, respectively, and a higher allocation of interest costs to NextEra Energy Resources. The increase in interest income in 2010 and 2009 is primarily due to earnings on an energy related loan made to a third party by a Capital Holdings subsidiary. The federal and state income tax benefits reflect consolidating income tax adjustments and, in 2010, include a one time income tax benefit of $24 million related to deferred income taxes. Other includes all other corporate income and expenses, as well as other business activities. The decline in other in 2010 is primarily due to an $11 million after tax loss on the s ale of assets held under leveraged leases; the pretax amount ($17 million) of such loss is reflected in other net in NextEra Energys consolidated statements of income. The increase in other in 2009 primarily reflects realized and unrealized gains on investments which are reflected in other net in the consolidated statements of income. Liquidity and Capital Resources NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, payment of maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated funds, short and long term borrowings, and the issuance, from time to time, of short and long term debt and equity securities, consistent with NextEra Energys and FPLs objective of maintaining, on a long term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NextEra Energy, FPL and Capital Ho ldings rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NextEra Energy, FPL and Capital Holdings to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short and long term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements. The global and domestic credit and capital markets experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in the recent past. This significantly affected the cost and available sources of liquidity in the financial markets. FPL and Capital Holdings have continued to have access to commercial paper and short and long term credit and capital markets. If capital and credit market conditions change, this could alter spending plans and affect working capital at FPL and NextEra Energy Resources. Available Liquidity At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energys total net available liquidity was approximately $6.3 billion, of which FPLs portion was approximately $3.1 billion. The components of each companys net available liquidity at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Maturity Date FPL Capital Holdings NextEra Energy Consoli dated FPL Capital Holdings (millions) Bank revolving line of credit facilities(a) $ 2,973 $ 4,417 $ 7,390 (b) (b) Less letters of credit (8 ) (771 ) (779 ) 2,965 3,646 6,611 Revolving credit facility 250 250 2014 Less borrowings 250 250 Subtotal 3,215 3,646 6,861 Cash and cash equivalents 20 282 302 Less commercial paper (101 ) (788 ) (889 ) Net available liquidity $ 3,134 $ 3,140 $ 6,274 (a) Provide for the funding of loans up to $7,390 million ($2,973 million for FPL) and the issuance of letters of credit up to $6,390 million ($2,473 million for FPL). The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes, including to provide back up liquidity for FPLs and Capital Holdings commercial paper programs and other short term borrowings and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies or their subsidiaries operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPLs bank revolving line of credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $633 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds (tax exempt bonds) in the event they are tendered by individual bond holders and not remarketed prior to maturity. (b) $17 million of FPLs and $40 million of Capital Holdings bank revolving line of credit facilities expire in 2012. The remaining portion of bank revolving line of credit facilities for FPL and Capital Holdings expires in 2013. 43 As of February 24, 2011, 58 banks participate in FPLs and Capital Holdings bank revolving line of credit facilities and FPLs revolving credit facility, with no one bank providing more than 7% of the combined bank revolving line of credit facilities and FPLs revolving credit facility. Pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement, NextEra Energy guarantees the payment of Capital Holdings debt obligations under the bank revolving line of credit facilities. As a precondition for Capital Holdings to borrow or to issue letters of credit under the terms of its bank revolving line of credit facilities, among other things, NextEra Energys ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed a stated ratio. The Capital Holdings bank revolving line of credit facilities also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, NextEra Energys ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding the specified ratio. Similarly, as a precondition for FPL to borrow or to issue letters of credit under the terms of its bank revolving line of credit facilities and revolving credit facility, among other things, FPLs ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL bank revolving line of credit facilities and revolving credit facility also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, FPLs ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding the specified ratio. At December 31, 2010, each of NextEra Energy and FPL was in compliance with its required ratio. In December 2010, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources (the borrower) entered into two Canadian $150 million, variable rate, three year bank revolving credit agreements that expire in 2013 (both credit agreements can be extended for up to one additional year with the lenders consent). Under one of the credit agreements, if the borrower receives sufficient commitment offers from other interested lenders, the borrower may elect to increase the principal amount of credit available under the credit agreement to an amount not to exceed Canadian $600 million. Under both credit agreements, subject to satisfying certain preconditions, the borrower has the option at the end of the revolving credit term to convert any outstanding borrowings into a one year term loan. Borrowings under the credit agreements can be used for the borrowers general corporate purposes, including the purchase, development, construction, and or operation of Canadian electricity generating assets, including the repayment of debt assumed in connection with the purchase of such assets. All borrowings under the credit agreements are guaranteed by Capital Holdings, which payment obligations are in turn guaranteed by NextEra Energy pursuant to the 1998 guarantee agreement with Capital Holdings. As a precondition to borrow or issue letters of credit under the terms of the credit agreements, among other things, NextEra Energys ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed a stated ratio. The credit agreements also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, NextEra Energys ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding the specified ratio. As of December 31, 2010, Canadian $82 million (approximately US $82 million) had been borrowed under one of the credit agreements (see Cash Flow below). As of February 24, 2011, a total of Canadian $203 million (approximately US $203 million) had been borrowed under the two credit agreements. Also, two indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have each established an $80 million letter of credit facility. One of the facilities expires in 2017 and serves as security for certain obligations of the subsidiary under commodity hedge agreements. The other facility expires in 2018 and serves as security for certain obligations of the subsidiary under power purchase agreements. In December 2010, NextEra Energy completed the program it commenced in January 2009 under which it offered and sold, from time to time, NextEra Energy common stock having a gross sales price of up to $400 million. During 2010 and 2009, NextEra Energy received gross proceeds through the sale and issuance of common stock under this program of approximately $240 million and $160 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010, FPL had the capacity to absorb up to approximately $205 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking recovery through a rate adjustment from the FPSC or filing a petition with the FPSC. See Note 1 Revenues and Rates. 44 The Dodd Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 which, among other things, provides for the regulation of the OTC derivatives market. While the legislation is broad and detailed, substantial portions of the legislation require implementing rules to be adopted by federal governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the SEC and the CFTC. The Dodd Frank Act generally requires certain OTC derivative transactions (including asset backed OTC derivatives used to hedge risks associated with commodity and interest rate exposure) to be executed by certain types of entities through an exchange or to be centrally cleared. However, the Dodd Frank Act provides an exemption from mandatory clearing requirements for transactions entered into by non swap dealers or non major swap participants and other non financial entities, as defined in the Dodd Frank Act, that are used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. The Dodd Frank Act also includes provisions under which the CFTC may impose capital and margin requirements on certain entities for transactions, including those that are used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. However, key legislators and regulators have indicated that it is not their intention to impose capital and margin requirements on counterparties that are eligible to use transactions to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. Final rules on OTC derivative related provisions of the Dodd Frank Act are required to be established through CFTC and SEC rulemakings within 360 days after the date of enactment. If, as a result of the rulemaking associated with the Dodd Frank Act, FPL and NextEra Energy Resources do not qualify for an exemption related to clearing and margining requirements, FPL and NextEra Energy Resources would be subject to higher margin requirements. It is possible that portions of NextEra Energy Resources business may be subject to capital, reporting, recordkeeping and business conduct requirements and standards in addition to the already mentioned margin requirements. Depending on the outcome of these rules, system upgrades and business process modifications would likely be necessary to comply. NextEra Energy and FPL cannot predict the final rules that will be adopted to implement the OTC derivatives market provisions of the Dodd Frank Act. Those rules could negatively affect NextEra Energys and FPLs ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risks, which could have a material adverse effect on NextEra Energys and FPLs financial results. The rules also could require NextEra Energy Resources to restructure part of its energy marketing and trading operations or to discontinue certain portions of its business. In addition, if the rules require NextEra Energy and FPL to post cash collateral with respect to swap transactions, NextEra Energy&#8217 ;s and FPLs liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and their ability to enter into OTC derivatives to hedge commodity and interest rate risks could be significantly limited. Reporting and compliance requirements of the rules also could significantly increase operating costs and expose NextEra Energy and FPL to penalties for non compliance. Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Guarantees NextEra Energy and FPL obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy had approximately $977 million of standby letters of credit ($17 million for FPL), approximately $87 million of surety bonds ($51 million for FPL) and approximately $9.5 billion notional amount of guarantees ($43 million for FPL), of which approximately $6.1 billion ($34 million for FPL) letters of credit and guarantees have expiration dates within the next five years. An aggregate of approximately $779 million ($8 million for FPL) of the standby letters of credit at December 31, 2010 were issued under FPL s and Capital Holdings credit facilities. See Available Liquidity above. Letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees support, among other things, the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities, debt and related reserves, nuclear activities, capital expenditures for wind development and other contractual agreements. Each of NextEra Energy and FPL believe it is unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees. Accordingly, at December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy and FPL did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees. In addition, NextEra Energy has guaranteed certain payment obligations of Capital Holdings, including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees, and Capital Holdings has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of NextEra Energy Resources and its subsidiaries. See Note 14 Commitments. Shelf Registration In August 2009, NextEra Energy, Capital Holdings, FPL and certain affiliated trusts filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors. As of February 24, 2011, securities that may be issued under the registration statement, which became effective upon filing, include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, preferred trust securities, common stock, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities. As of February 24, 2011, NextEra Energy and Capital Holdings had approximately $2.7 billion (issuable by either or both of them up to such aggregate amount) of board authorized available capacity, and FPL had $1.6 billion of board authorized available capacity. 45 Credit Ratings NextEra Energys and FPLs liquidity, ability to access credit and capital markets, cost of borrowings and collateral posting requirements under certain agreements are dependent on their credit ratings. At February 24, 2011, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to NextEra Energy, FPL and Capital Holdings: Moodys(a) S&P(a) Fitch(a) NextEra Energy:(b) Corporate credit rating Baa1 A A FPL:(b) Corporate credit rating A2 A A First mortgage bonds Aa3 A AA Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds VMIG 1 A A+ Commercial paper P 1 A 2 F1 Capital Holdings:(b) Corporate credit rating Baa1 A A Debentures Baa1 BBB+ A Junior subordinated debentures Baa2 BBB BBB Commercial paper P 2 A 2 F1 (a) A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. (b) The outlook indicated by Moodys, S&P and Fitch is stable, stable and negative, respectively. NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the FPL, Capital Holdings and Canadian credit facilities, the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities. Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short term debt issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities. In addition, a ratings downgrade could result in the re quirement that NextEra Energy subsidiaries, including FPL, post collateral under certain agreements, including those related to fuel procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding, debt related reserves and trading activities. FPLs and Capital Holdings credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements. See Available Liquidity above. Cash Flow The changes in cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows: NextEra Energy FPL Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,834 $ 4,463 $ 3,403 $ 1,934 $ 2,871 $ 2,180 Net cash used in investing activities (5,284 ) (5,935 ) (5,808 ) (2,561 ) (2,726 ) (2,427 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,514 1,175 2,650 564 (182 ) 304 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 64 $ (297 ) $ 245 $ (63 ) $ (37 ) $ 57 NextEra Energys cash and cash equivalents increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflecting cash generated by operating activities, net issuances of long term debt, issuance of common stock, proceeds from the sale of differential membership interests and cash grants received under the Recovery Act. These inflows were partially offset by capital investments by FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, a net decrease in short term debt and the payment of common stock dividends to NextEra Energy shareholders. NextEra Energys cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflect cash generated by net income and derivative related activities, including margin cash collateral provided from NextEra Energy Resources counterparties as a result of changing energy prices, prepaid option premiums and settlements. These inflows were partially offset by cash outflows related to FPLs cost recovery clauses and franchise fees, primarily the fuel clause. NextEra Energys cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflect capital investments, including nuclear fuel purchases, of approximately $2.7 billion by FPL to expand and enhance its electric system and generating facilities to continue to provide reliable service to meet the power needs of present and future customers and investments in independent power projects, including nuclear fuel, of approximately $3.1 billion by NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra Energys cash flows from investing activities also include approximately $588 million (comprised of $427 million and $161 million at NextEra Energy Resources and FPL, respectively) of cash grants under the Recovery Act, the purchase and sale of restricted securities held in the special use funds, including the reinvestment of fund earn ings and new contributions by NextEra Energy Resources, as well as other investment activity, primarily at Capital Holdings. NextEra Energy expects to receive additional cash grants under the Recovery Act during 2011. 46 During the year ended December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy generated proceeds from financing activities of approximately $4.3 billion, including $261 million in proceeds from the sale of differential membership interests, $308 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily under NextEra Energys continuous offering agreement (see Available Liquidity above), and the following long term debt issuances and borrowings: Date Issued Company Debt Issuances/Borrowings Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date (millions) February 2010 FPL First mortgage bonds 5.69% $ 500 2040 March 2010 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Senior secured limited recourse notes 6.56% 305 2030 April 2010 Capital Holdings Term loan Variable (a) 100 2013 April 2010 Capital Holdings Term loan Variable (a) 100 2013 April 2010 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Senior secured limited recourse term loan Variable (a)(b) 255 2027 May 2010 Capital Holdings Debentures 2.55% (b) 250 2013 June 2010 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Limited recourse term loan Variable (a) 78 2015 August 2010 Capital Holdings Debentures 2.60% (b) 400 2015 September 2010 Capital Holdings Term loan Variable (a) 50 2013 September 2010 Capital Holdings Debentures related to NextEra Energys equity units 1.90% 403 2015 September 2010 Capital Holdings Japanese yen denominated senior notes 5.1325% (c) 120 (c) 2030 September 2010 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Senior secured limited recourse term loan Variable (a)(b) 297 2028 September 2010 Capital Holdings Term loan Variable (a) 50 2013 September 2010 Capital Holdings Term loan Variable (a) 110 2014 December 2010 FPL First mortgage bonds 5.25% 400 2041 December 2010 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Canadian revolving credit facility Variable (a) 82 2013 December 2010 NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary Senior secured limited recourse term loan Variable (a)(b) 231 2018 $ 3,731 (a) Variable rate is based on an underlying index plus a margin.

On April 30, 2010, Peace Garden Wind Funding, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, sold its Class B membership interests in Peace Garden Wind, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources with ownership interests in two wind generation facilities with generating capability totaling approximately 170 mw located in North Dakota, to certain third party investors for approximately $190 million. On September 30, 2010, Heartland Wind Funding, LLC (Heartland Wind Funding), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, sold Class B membership interests in Heartland Wind, LLC (Heartland Wind), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, with ownership interests in three wind generation facilities with generating capability totaling approximately 309 mw located in North Dakota and Iowa, to a third party investor. At closing, Heartland Wind Funding received approximately $71 million and will receive future capital contributions from the third party investor on a semi annual basis through December 31, 2018 based on the amount of PTCs generated by Heartland Wind. At December 31, 2010, the future capital contributions are expected to total approximately $207 milli on based on projected wind generation. During the year ended December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy paid approximately $2.7 billion in connection with financing activities, including $357 million in principal payments on NextEra Energy Resources debt, $370 million in principal payments on Capital Holdings debt, $42 million in principal payments on FPLs storm recovery bonds, a net decrease in short term debt of $1.1 billion (comprised of $414 million and $717 million at Capital Holdings and FPL, respectively) and $823 million for the payment of dividends on NextEra Energys common stock. NextEra Energys cash and cash equivalents decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflecting capital investments by FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, the payment of common stock dividends to NextEra Energy shareholders and margin cash collateral provided to NextEra Energy Resources derivative instrument counterparties. These outflows were partially offset by cash generated by operating activities, net issuances of both long and short term debt and the issuance of common stock. 47 Contractual Obligations and Estimated Planned Capital Expenditures NextEra Energys and FPLs commitments at December 31, 2010 were as follows: 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (millions) Long term debt, including interest:(a) FPL $ 389 $ 391 $ 782 $ 373 $ 374 $ 12,143 (b) $ 14,452 NextEra Energy Resources 709 715 839 579 677 4,220 7,739 Corporate and Other 1,885 719 1,157 881 1,605 12,417 18,664 Purchase obligations: FPL(c) 6,190 5,330 3,390 2,890 2,645 10,270 30,715 NextEra Energy Resources(d) 1,175 225 175 160 160 725 2,620 Asset retirement activities:(e) FPL(f) 7,106 7,106 NextEra Energy Resources(g) 2 2 9,736 9,740 Other Commitments: NextEra Energy Resources(h) 14 5 72 73 98 490 752 Total $ 10,364 $ 7,387 $ 6,415 $ 4,956 $ 5,559 $ 57,107 $ 91,788 (a) Includes principal, interest and interest rate swaps. Variable rate interest was computed using December 31, 2010 rates. (b) Includes $633 million of tax exempt bonds that permit individual bond holders to tender the bonds for purchase at any time prior to maturity. In the event bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL would be required to purchase the tax exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2010, all tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase have been successfully remarketed. FPLs bank revolving line of credit facilities are available to support the purchase of tax exempt bonds. (c) Represents required capacity and minimum payments under long term purchased power and fuel contracts (see Note 14 Contracts), and projected capital expenditures through 2015 (see Note 14 Commitments). (d) Represents firm commitments primarily in connection with construction activities, and fuel related and transmission service contracts. See Note 14 Commitments and Contracts. (e) Represents expected cash payments adjusted for inflation for estimated costs to perform asset retirement activities. (f) At December 31, 2010, FPL had approximately $2,512 million in restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPLs nuclear units, which are included in NextEra Energys and FPLs special use funds. See Note 13. (g) At December 31, 2010, NextEra Energy Resources 88.23% portion of Seabrooks and 70% portion of Duane Arnolds and its Point Beachs restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission its nuclear units totaled approximately $1,105 million and are included in NextEra Energys special use funds. See Note 13. (h) Represents estimated cash distributions related to membership interests and payments related to the acquisition of certain development rights. For further discussion of membership interests, see Note 1 Sale of Differential Membership Interests. Covenants NextEra Energys charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of NextEra Energy to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. During the first quarter of 2010, NextEra Energy increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.4725 to $0.50 per share. In February 2011, NextEra Energy announced that it would increase the quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.50 to $0.55 per share. FPL pays dividends to NextEra Energy in a manner consistent with FPLs long term targeted capital structure. The mortgage securing FPLs first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to NextEra Energy and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. In light of FPLs current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations. Under the mortgage, in some cases, the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock is restricted. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPLs use of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2010, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage. FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPLs first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior FPL indebtedness. As of December 31, 2010, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 would have been approximately 6.3 times the annual interest requirements and approximately 3.6 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or q ualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. As of December 31, 2010, FPL could have issued in excess of $8.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.8 billion based on retired first mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2010, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes. 48 In September 2006, NextEra Energy and Capital Holdings executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (September 2006 RCC) in connection with Capital Holdings offering of $350 million principal amount of Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 and $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (collectively, Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long term indebtedness (covered debt) of Capital Holdings (other than the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NextEra Energy. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the September 200 6 RCC. The September 2006 RCC provides that Capital Holdings may redeem, and NextEra Energy or Capital Holdings may purchase, any Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2006 RCC. Qualifying securities are securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 180 days prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures. In June 2007, NextEra Energy and Capital Holdings executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (June 2007 RCC) in connection with Capital Holdings offering of $400 million principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series C junior subordinated debentures). The June 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of Capital Holdings (other than the Series C junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NextEra Energy. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the June 2007 RCC. The June 2007 RCC provides that Capital Holdings may redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (collectively, defease), and NextEra Energy and any majority owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy or Capital Holdings may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before June 15, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series C junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the June 2007 RCC. In September 2007, NextEra Energy and Capital Holdings executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (September 2007 RCC) in connection with Capital Holdings offering of $250 million principal amount of its Series D Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 and $350 million principal amount of Series E Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (collectively, Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates NextEra Energys and FPLs significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Critical accounting policies are those that NextEra Energy and FPL believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 49 NextEra Energy and FPL consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statements: Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities NextEra Energy and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with outstanding and forecasted debt. In addition, NextEra Energy, through NextEra Energy Resources, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets. NextEra Energy Resources provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take a dvantage of expected future favorable price movements. Accounting pronouncements, which require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, apply not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and fuel. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. In general, the models estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. The near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the ma rket is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contract. Substantially all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by FPL are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled. Upon settlement, any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel or capacity clauses. In NextEra Energys non rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, changes in derivative fair values are recognized in current earnings, un less the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge. For those transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges, much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of common shareholders equity, rather than being recognized in current earnings. For those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges, the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged. Much of the existing accounting guidance related to derivatives focuses on when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from derivative accounting rules, however the guidance does not address all contract issues. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts. In the event changes in interpretation occur, it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income. Certain economic hedging transactions at NextEra Energy Resources do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the statement of income, often resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings. This could be significant to NextEra Energy Resources results because often the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market (such as the physical assets from which power is generated) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. Because of this, NextEra Energys management views result s expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Results of Operations and Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits NextEra Energy sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries. NextEra Energy also has a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) which includes a non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees. The impact of the SERP component is included within the pension plan as discussed below. In addition to pension benefits, NextEra Energy sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits (other benefits plan) for retirees of NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries meeti ng certain eligibility requirements. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan. The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance. NextEra Energy allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria. 50 NextEra Energys regulatory assets and liabilities were established in association with the implementation of accounting guidance in a prior year which requires recognition of the funded status of benefit plans in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in comprehensive income within shareholders equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NextEra Energy is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, the results of implementing the accounting guidance were reflected at NextEra Energy and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that were estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would have been recorded in accumu lated other comprehensive income (AOCI) were classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NextEra Energy in accordance with regulatory treatment. NextEra Energys income from its pension plan, net of the cost of the other benefits plan, was approximately $38 million, $75 million and $86 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The corresponding amounts allocated to FPL were $19 million, $50 million and $60 million, respectively. Pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all years for the pension plan and 8.00% for all years for the other benefits plan, assumed increases in salary of 4.00% for all years, and weighted average discount rates of 5.50%, 6.90% and 6.25% for the pension plan and 5.50%, 6.90% and 6.35% for the other benefits plan for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on current health care costs (as related to other benefits), the projected 2010 trend assumption used to measure the expected cost of health care benefits covered by the plans for those under age 65 is 7.60% for medical and 8.20% for prescription drug benefits and for those age 65 and over is 7.25% for medical and 7.75% for prescription drug benefits. These rates are assumed to decrease over the next 8 years for medical benefits and 10 years for prescription drug benefits to the ultimate trend rate of 5.50% and remain at that level thereafter. The ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in 2018 for medical benefits and 2020 for prescription drug benefits. In developing these assumptions, NextEra Energy evaluated input from its actuaries, as well as information available in the marketplace. For the expected long term rate of return on fund assets, NextEra Energy considered 10 year and 20 year historical median returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds, as well as its funds historical compounded returns. NextEra Energy also considered input from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. NextEra Energy believes that 7.75% and 8.00% are reasonable long term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets, respectively. NextEra Energy will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as necessary. NextEra Energy bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period following the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuaria l valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits plan expense and income only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets. The following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant: Decrease in 2010 Net Periodic Benefit Income Change in Assumption NextEra Energy FPL (millions) Expected long term rate of return (0.5 ) % $ 16 $ 11 Discount rate (0.5 ) % $ $ Salary increase 0.5 % $ 2 $ 1 Health care cost trend rate(a) 1.0 % $ 1 $ 1 (a) Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits. However, this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in NextEra Energys other benefits plan. The fair value of plan assets has increased from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2009 to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2010 for the pension plan and remained constant at $32 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010 for the other benefits plan. Management believes that, based on the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, NextEra Energy will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. In December 2010, $29 million was transferred from the qualified pension plan as reimbursement for eligible retiree medical expenses paid by NextEra Energy during the year pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. NextEra Energy anticipates paying approximately $28 million for eligible retiree medical expenses on behal f of the other benefits plan during 2011 with substantially all of that amount being reimbursed through a transfer of assets from the qualified pension plan. See Note 2. 51 Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets NextEra Energy evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the assets fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized. Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil/Solar Dismantlement The components of NextEra Energys and FPLs decommissioning of nuclear plants, dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs are as follows: FPL Nuclear Decommissioning Fossil/Solar Dismantlement Interim Removal Costs and Other NextEra Energy Resources NextEra Energy December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 (millions) AROs $ 1,057 $ 1,807 $ 23 $ 23 $ 3 $ 3 $ 556 $ 585 $ 1,639 $ 2,418 Less capitalized ARO asset net of accumulated depreciation 50 4 5 4 55 Accrued asset removal costs(a) 207 196 336 318 1,701 1,737 2,244 2,251 Asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference(a) 1,571 644 22 28 (1 ) (1 ) 1,592 671 Accrued decommissioning, dismantlement and other accrued asset removal costs $ 2,835 (b) $ 2,597 (b) $ 377 (b) $ 364 (b) $ 1,703 (b) $ 1,739 (b) $ 556 $ 585 $ 5,471 $ 5,285 (a) Regulatory liability on NextEra Energys and FPLs consolidated balance sheets. (b) Represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes. NextEra Energy and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets. See Note 1 Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 13. For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the FPSC at least every five years. The most recent studies, filed in 2010, indicate that FPLs portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under the spent fuel settlement agreement, is approximately $6.2 billion, or $2.3 billion in 2010 dollars. The studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPLs nuclear units. FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommiss ioning, dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies became effective January 1, 2010. At December 31, 2010, FPLs portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately $860 million, or $455 million expressed in 2010 dollars. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered AROs. In addition, FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. Any differences between the ARO amount recorded and the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. NextEra Energy Resources records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs which is determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning. The liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At December 31, 2010, the ARO for nuclear decommissioning of NextEra Energy Resources nuclear plants totaled approximately $478 million. NextEra Energy Resources portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under the spent fuel settlement agreement, is estima ted to be approximately $9.5 billion, or $1.8 billion expressed in 2010 dollars. 52 The calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and fossil and solar dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, NextEra Energy and FPL also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, NextEra Energy and FPL are required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates would increase NextEra Energys and FPLs ARO as of December 31, 2010 by $133 million and $82 million, respectively. Regulatory Accounting Accounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. If FPL were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period. NextEra Energys and FPLs regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows: NextEra Energy FPL December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 Regulatory assets: (millions) Current: Deferred clause and franchise expenses $ 368 $ 69 $ 368 $ 69 Derivatives $ 236 $ 68 $ 236 $ 68 Other $ 82 $ 72 $ 76 $ 69 Noncurrent: Securitized storm recovery costs $ 581 $ 644 $ 581 $ 644 Other $ 329 $ 265 $ 293 $ 214 Regulatory liabilities: Current: Deferred clause and franchise revenues $ 47 $ 377 $ 47 $ 377 Other $ 4 $ 2 $ $ Noncurrent: Accrued asset removal costs $ 2,244 $ 2,251 $ 2,244 $ 2,251 Asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference $ 1,592 $ 671 $ 1,592 $ 671 Other $ 423 $ 260 $ 377 $ 244 All regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during the recovery period. See Note 1 for a discussion of NextEra Energys and FPLs other significant accounting policies. Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity Energy Marketing and Trading Certain of NextEra Energys subsidiaries, including FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NextEra Energy, through NextEra Energy Resources, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets. NextEra Energy Resources provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NextEra Energys and FPLs consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. For NextEra Energys non rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, unless hedge accounting is applied essentially all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases and sales are recognized on a net basis in fuel, purchased power and interchange expe nse; and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NextEra Energys consolidated statements of income. See Note 3. 53 The changes in the fair value of NextEra Energys consolidated subsidiaries energy contract derivative instruments were as follows: Hedges on Owned Assets Trading Non Qualifying OCI FPL Cost Recovery Clauses NextEra Energy Total (millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 $ 56 $ 143 $ 114 $ (1,108 ) $ (795 ) Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (160 ) (208 ) (180 ) 1,734 1,186 Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI 197 197 Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings 28 28 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 143 163 (690 ) (384 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 39 126 131 (64 ) 232 Reclassification to realized at settlement of contracts (98 ) (126 ) (102 ) 492 166 Inception value of new contracts 108 (45 ) 63 Effective portion of changes in fair value recorded in OCI 20 20 Ineffective portion of changes in fair value recorded in earnings 1 1 Changes in fair value excluding reclassification to realized 76 457 (664 ) (131 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010 125 413 49 (236 ) 351 Net option premium payments (receipts) (101 ) 9 (92 ) Net margin cash collateral paid 29 Total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2010 $ 24 $ 422 $ 49 $ (236 ) $ 288 NextEra Energys total mark to market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2010 shown above are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows: December 31, 2010 (millions) Current derivative assets $ 453 Noncurrent other assets 487 Current derivative liabilities (468 ) Noncurrent derivative liabilities (184 ) NextEra Energys total mark to market energy contract net assets $ 288 The sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Maturity 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (millions) Trading: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets $ 8 $ (31 ) $ (42 ) $ $ $ $ (65 ) Significant other observable inputs (127 ) (30 ) 27 2 3 4 (121 ) Significant unobservable inputs 146 40 26 (2 ) 210 Total 27 (21 ) 11 3 4 24 Owned Assets Non Qualifying: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (27 ) (18 ) (1 ) (46 ) Significant other observable inputs 156 118 29 22 26 38 389 Significant unobservable inputs 26 27 12 7 8 (1 ) 79 Total 155 127 40 29 34 37 422 Owned Assets OCI: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 30 15 45 Significant other observable inputs 11 (7 ) 4 Significant unobservable inputs Total 41 8 49 Owned Assets FPL Cost Recovery Clauses: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Significant other observable inputs (243 ) (243 ) Significant unobservable inputs 7 7 Total (236 ) (236 ) Total sources of fair value $ (13 ) $ 114 $ 51 $ 29 $ 37 $ 41 $ 259 54 Market Risk Sensitivity Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NextEra Energy and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices or currency exchange rates over the next year. With respect to certain debt issuances and borrowings, Capital Holdings has entered into three cross currency swaps, two to hedge against currency movements with respect to both interest and principal payments and one to hedge against currency and interest rate movements with respect to both interest and principal payments. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of these cross currency swaps was approximately $44 million and $(1) million, respectively. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks. With respect to commodities, NextEra Energys Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, is responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities. NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NextEra Energy manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees. Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. NextEra Energys credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggrega te basis. Commodity price risk NextEra Energy uses a value at risk (VaR) model to measure market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the VaR figures are as follows: Trading Non Qualifying Hedges and Hedges in OCI and FPL Cost Recovery Clauses(a) Total FPL NextEra Energy Resources NextEra Energy FPL NextEra Energy Resources NextEra Energy FPL NextEra Energy Resources NextEra Energy (millions) December 31, 2009 $ $ 2 $ 2 $ 61 $ 51 $ 25 $ 61 $ 51 $ 25 December 31, 2010 $ $ 3 $ 3 $ 51 $ 21 $ 35 $ 51 $ 23 $ 36 Average for the period ended December 31, 2010 $ $ 4 $ 4 $ 48 $ 32 $ 29 $ 48 $ 34 $ 29 (a) Non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI and FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements. Interest rate risk NextEra Energy and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and other investments. NextEra Energy and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate swaps and adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization. The following are estimates of the fair value of NextEra Energys and FPLs financial instruments: December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (millions) NextEra Energy: Fixed income securities: Special use funds $ 1,701 $ 1,701 (a) $ 1,685 $ 1,685 (a) Other investments $ 114 $ 114 (a) $ 104 $ 104 (a) Long term debt, including current maturities $ 19,929 $ 20,756 (b) $ 16,869 $ 17,256 (b) Interest rate swaps net unrealized losses $ (16 ) $ (16 )(c) $ (17 ) $ (17 )(c) FPL: Fixed income securities special use funds $ 1,375 $ 1,375 (a) $ 1,384 $ 1,384 (a) Long term debt, including current maturities $ 6,727 $ 7,236 (b) $ 5,836 $ 6,055 (b) (a) Based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues. (b) Based on market prices provided by external sources. (c) Based on market prices modeled internally. 55 The special use funds of NextEra Energy and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of NextEra Energys and FPLs nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value. At FPL, adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The market value adjustments of NextEra Energys non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally m ore liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer term securities, as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin until at least 2030 (2032 at FPL). NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements. At December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value for NextEra Energys interest rate swaps was as follows: Notional Amount Effective Date Maturity Date Rate Paid Rate Received Estimated Fair Value (millions) (millions) Fair value hedges Capital Holdings: $ 300 June 2008 September 2011 Variable (a) 5.625 % $ 8 $ 250 May 2010 November 2013 Variable (b) 2.55 % 4 $ 400 August 2010 September 2015 Variable (c) 2.60 % (9 ) Total fair value hedges 3 Cash flow hedges: NextEra Energy Resources: $ 43 December 2003 December 2017 4.245 % Variable (d) (3 ) $ 14 April 2004 December 2017 3.845 % Variable (d) (1 ) $ 150 December 2005 November 2019 4.905 % Variable (d) (14 ) $ 384 January 2007 January 2022 5.390 % Variable (e) (42 ) $ 83 January 2008 September 2011 3.2050 % Variable (d) (2 ) $ 321 January 2009 December 2016 2.680 % Variable (d) (7 ) $ 124 January 2009(f) December 2023 3.725 % Variable (d) 3 $ 85 January 2009 December 2023 2.578 % Variable (g) 3 $ 19 March 2009 December 2016 2.655 % Variable (d) $ 7 March 2009(f) December 2023 3.960 % Variable (d) $ 308 May 2009 May 2017 3.015 % Variable (d) (10 ) $ 106 May 2009(f) May 2024 4.663 % Variable (d) 1 $ 128 December 2009 December 2019 3.830 % Variable (d) (7 ) $ 52 December 2009(f) September 2021 5.500 % Variable (d) $ 250 April 2010 January 2027 4.040 % Variable (e) (15 ) $ 283 October 2010 September 2028 2.822 % Variable (d) 15 $ 201 December 2010 January 2018 2.313 % Variable (e) (2 ) Capital Holdings: $ 250 October 2010(f) June 2021 2.744 % Variable (d) 21 $ 250 October 2010(f) September 2021 2.819 % Variable (d) 21 $ 250 October 2010(f) June 2023 3.479 % Variable (d) 20 Total cash flow hedges (19 ) Total interest rate swaps $ (16 ) (a) Three month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.18896%.

Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near term market change, the net fair value of NextEra Energys net liabilities would increase by approximately $962 million ($385 million for FPL) at December 31, 2010. 56 Equity price risk Included in the nuclear decommissioning reserve funds of NextEra Energy are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $2,041 million and $1,705 million ($1,262 million and $1,024 million for FPL) at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near term market change, would result in a $186 million ($116 million for FPL) reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL, or adjustments to OCI for NextEra Energys non rate regulated operations, at December 31, 2010. Credit risk For all derivative and contractual transactions, NextEra Energys energy marketing and trading operations, which includes FPLs energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Relevant considerations when assessing NextEra Energys energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include: Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry. Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the United States. Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral. The use of master netting agreements to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. NextEra Energys policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties. Based on NextEra Energys policies and risk exposures related to credit, NextEra Energy and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial positions as a result of counterparty nonperformance. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 99% of NextEra Energys and 100% of FPLs energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.
