Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEWNEEs operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal subsidiaries, FPL, which serves approximately 4.6 million customer accounts in Florida and is one of the largest rate regulated electric utilities in the U.S., and NEER, which together with its affiliated entities is the largest generator in the U.S. of renewable energy from the wind and sun. The table below presents NEEs net income and earnings per share by reportable segment FPL, NEER and Corporate and Other, which is primarily comprised of interest expense, the operating results of FPL FiberNet, Lone Star and other business activities, as well as other income and expense items, including income taxes and eliminating entries (see Note 15 for additional segment information). The 41Table of Contentsdiscussion that follows should be read in conjunction with the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. In the discussion below and in Results of Operations, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. Net Income Earnings Per Share,assuming dilution Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (millions) FPL$1,068 $945 $831 $2.55 $2.29 $2.04NEER(a)774 980 759 1.85 2.37 1.86Corporate and Other81 32 25 0.19 0.08 0.07NEE$1,923 $1,957 $1,615 $4.59 $4.74 $3.97 (a)NEERs results reflect an allocation of interest expense from NEECH to NEER based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and allocated shared service costs.For the five years ended December 31, 2011, NEE delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 33%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500s 1% decline, the Dow Jones US Electricitys 14% return and the S&P 500 Electric Utilities 18% return. The historical stock performance of NEEs common stock shown in the performance graph below is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.Adjusted EarningsNEE prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings), a non GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance based compensation under NEEs employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to investors. NEEs management believes adjusted earnings provides a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with GAAP, management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared in accordance with GAAP.42Table of ContentsAdjusted earnings exclude the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges (as described below), OTTI losses on securities held in NEERs nuclear decommissioning funds, net of the reversal of previously recognized OTTI losses on securities sold and losses on securities where price recovery was deemed unlikely (collectively, OTTI reversals) and, in 2011, the after tax loss on the sale of natural gas fired generating assets. OTTI reversals are reported in other net in NEEs consolidated statements of income.NEE and NEER segregate into two categories unrealized mark to market gains and losses on energy derivative transactions which are used to manage commodity price risk. The first category, referred to as trading activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and, in 2011 and 2010, the impact related to exiting hedged positions on future gas drilling opportunities. The second category, referred to as non qualifying hedges, represents certain hedging transactions entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or hedge accounting treatment is not elected. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market (such as the physical assets from which power is generated) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. For this reason, NEEs management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. See Note 4 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.In 2011, subsidiaries of NEER completed the sales of their ownership interest in five natural gas fired generating plants with a total generating capacity of approximately 2,700 mw located in California, Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and Rhode Island. In connection with these sales, a loss of approximately $151 million ($98 million total after tax with $92 million of this loss recorded by NEER) was recorded in NEEs consolidated statements of income, which due to its nature and significance, was excluded from adjusted earnings. See Note 3.The following table provides details of the net unrealized after tax gains and losses from non qualifying hedges, after tax OTTI losses, net of reversals and the after tax loss on the sale of the natural gas fired generating assets. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) Net unrealized mark to market after tax gains (losses) from non qualifying hedge activity(a)$190 $175 $(20) OTTI after tax losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds, net of OTTI reversals$(6) $4 $(13) After tax loss on sale of natural gas fired assets(b)$(98) $ $ (a)$193 million, $176 million and $(20) million, respectively, is included in NEERs net income; the balance, if any, is included in Corporate and Other.(b)$92 million is included in NEERs net income; the balance is included in Corporate and Other.The change in unrealized mark to market activity from non qualifying hedges is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized. As a general rule, a gain (loss) in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP.2011 SummaryFPLs earned regulatory ROE was 11% in both 2010 and 2011 and FPL expects to earn an 11% regulatory ROE in 2012. FPLs increase in net income in 2011 was primarily driven by investments in plant in service and FPLs ability to use the surplus depreciation credit, as permitted under the 2010 rate agreement, to earn up to FPLs allowed 11% regulatory ROE on its retail rate base, as well as higher cost recovery clause results. The 2010 rate agreement results in retail base rates that remain effectively frozen until the end of 2012. Additionally, cost recovery for FPLs WCEC Unit No. 3 is permitted during the term of the agreement and FPL can vary the amount of surplus depreciation amortized in any one year subject to certain caps, provided its retail regulatory return on equity remains within the allowed range of 9% to 11%.NEERs earnings declined in 2011 reflecting the loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets, lower results from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses, extended and unplanned outages at Seabrook and lower deferred tax benefits associated with cash grants (convertible ITCs), partly offset by a higher wind resource and higher gas infrastructure results. In 2011, NEER added 379 mw of wind capacity and secured approximately 1,600 mw of long term wind power sales agreements. Additionally, in 2011 construction began on the 250 mw Genesis solar project in California and the 550 mw Desert Sunlight solar project in California, in which NEER has a 50% equity investment.43Table of ContentsCorporate and Others earnings in 2011 increased primarily due to state deferred income tax benefits related to state tax law changes and an income tax benefit related to the dissolution of a subsidiary.NEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flow from operations and short and long term borrowings and, from time to time, issuance of equity securities. As of February 9, 2012, NEEs total net available liquidity was approximately $5.1 billion, of which FPLs portion was approximately $2.8 billion.OutlookNEEs strategy at both of its major businesses seeks to meet customer needs more economically and reliably than competitors. Meeting customer needs frequently requires the commitment of large capital expenditures to projects that have long lives and such commitments are difficult to reverse once made. At the end of 2011, both FPL and NEER had made commitments to a variety of major capital projects that are expected to be completed over the next several years. While NEE management believes that these projects individually and collectively are attractive investments with the potential to create value for shareholders, there can be no guarantee that all or any of these projects will be successful. Because of their importance, management focuses particular attention on these large projects.In 2012, NEE expects to focus efforts in particular on the following initiatives:At FPL:Sustaining FPLs customer value proposition. The combination of low bills, good reliability and excellent customer service that FPL currently provides its customers is both an objective of FPLs strategy and an important contributor to its long term business success. FPL seeks to, at minimum, maintain and ideally improve its overall customer value proposition.Major Capital Projects: FPL is currently in a large capital expansion program and its objective is to bring these projects in on schedule and within budget. This program includes:modernizing its Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach power plants to high efficiency natural gas fired 1,200 mw units to be placed in service by 2013 and 2014, respectively,adding a total of approximately 450 mw to 490 mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units at St. Lucie and Turkey Point, to be placed in service by 2013, andpetitioning the FPSC in November 2011 to modernize its Port Everglades power plant to a high efficiency natural gas fired 1,280 mw unit which, if approved, is expected to be in service in 2016 and cost approximately $1.2 billion.Rate Case: In January 2012, FPL filed a formal notification with the FPSC indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding. The notification stated that, based on preliminary estimates, FPL expects to request a base rate increase of approximately $525 million effective January 2013 and an additional base rate increase of approximately $170 million annually commencing when the modernized Cape Canaveral plant becomes operational, which is expected to occur in June 2013.At NEER:Maintaining excellence in day to day operations. NEER has developed a track record of generally running its facilities reliably and cost effectively. The company seeks to, at minimum, maintain and ideally improve its operating performance.Wind: Add approximately 1,150 mw to 1,500 mw of new U.S. wind generation in 2012 and 600 mw of new Canadian wind generation between 2012 and 2015, andSolar: Add approximately 935 mw of new solar generation during the period 2012 through 2016, including the 250 mw Genesis solar project in California, the 99.8 mw Spain solar project, the 550 mw Desert Sunlight solar project in California, in which NEER has a 50% equity investment, and the 250 mw McCoy solar PV project located in the Mojave Desert near the Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar projects.At Lone Star, which is in the process of constructing approximately 320 miles of transmission lines and other associated facilities in Texas:Construction: Achieve commercial operations by the end of the first quarter of 2013.Rate Case: In January 2012, Lone Star filed a petition with the PUCT requesting, among other things, interim rates which would take effect when Lone Stars first substation is placed in service, currently projected to be in 2012, and final rates when the transmission lines are energized. If approved, based on the expected in service dates, the requested rates would result in annual revenues of approximately $14 million in 2012 and $110 million in 2013.In addition, NEE and FPL devote effort to numerous other initiatives designed to support their long term growth and development. There can be no guarantees that NEE or FPL will be successful in attaining their goals with respect to any of these initiatives.For additional information on certain of the above matters, see Item 1. Business.44Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSNEEs net income for 2011 was $1.92 billion, compared to $1.96 billion in 2010 and $1.61 billion in 2009. The decrease in NEEs 2011 net income was primarily driven by lower earnings at NEER, partly offset by improved results at FPL and income tax benefits at Corporate and Other. The increase in NEEs 2010 net income was primarily driven by improved results at FPL and by net unrealized mark to market after tax gains from non qualifying hedges at NEER.NEEs effective income tax rate for all periods presented reflects PTCs for wind projects at NEER and deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs under the Recovery Act. PTCs and deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs can significantly affect NEEs effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income. PTCs can be significantly affected by wind generation and by the expiration of PTCs after ten years of production. See Note 1 Income Taxes and Sale of Differential Membership Interests and Note 6.FPL: Results of OperationsFPLs net income for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1,068 million, $945 million and $831 million, respectively, representing an increase in 2011 of $123 million and an increase in 2010 of $114 million. FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the FPSC through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms.In 2011 and 2010, FPL earned a regulatory ROE of 11%, as permitted by the 2010 rate agreement, and expects to earn an 11% regulatory ROE in 2012. In 2011 and in 2010, growth in earnings for FPL was driven by:investment in plant in service and FPLs ability to use the surplus depreciation credit, andhigher cost recovery clause results, partly offset for 2010 by,lower AFUDC equity.FPLs operating revenues consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) Retail base$4,217 $4,190 $3,828Fuel cost recovery4,416 4,090 5,982Net deferral of retail fuel revenues (356)Net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues 356 Other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs, net of any deferrals1,751 1,638 1,840Other, primarily pole attachment rentals, transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees229 211 197Total$10,613 $10,485 $11,491Retail BaseAs permitted by the 2010 rate agreement, FPL collected approximately $101 million in retail base revenues through the capacity clause related to the placement in service of WCEC Unit No. 3 in May 2011. In addition, a base rate increase pursuant to an FPSC order which became effective March 1, 2010, increased retail base revenues by approximately $8 million and $68 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and retail base revenues increased in 2010 by $196 million resulting from WCEC Unit Nos. 1 and 2 placed in service in 2009.FPSC Rate OrderEffective March 1, 2010, pursuant to the FPSC rate order, new retail base rates for FPL were established, resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of approximately $75 million on an annualized basis. The FPSC rate order also established a regulatory ROE of 10.0% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points and an adjusted regulatory equity ratio of 59.1%. It also shifted certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity clause. In addition, the FPSC rate order directed FPL to reduce depreciation expense (surplus depreciation credit) over the 2010 to 2013 period related to a depreciation reserve surplus. Subsequently, the principal parties in FPLs 2009 rate case signed the 2010 rate agreement and, in February 2011, the FPSC issued a final order approving the 2010 rate agreement. Key elements of that rate agreement, which is effective through December 31, 2012, are as follows:Subject to the provisions of the 2010 rate agreement, retail base rates are effectively frozen through the end of 2012.Incremental cost recovery through FPLs capacity clause for the new combined cycle natural gas unit at WCEC Unit No. 3, which was placed in service in May 2011, is permitted up to the amount of the projected annual fuel savings for customers during the term of the 2010 rate agreement.Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an accelerated basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery 45Table of Contentspetition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kwh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $800 million.If FPLs earned regulatory ROE falls below 9%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If FPLs earned regulatory ROE rises above 11%, any party to the 2010 rate agreement may seek a reduction in FPLs retail base rates. In determining the regulatory ROE for all purposes under the 2010 rate agreement, earnings will be calculated on an actual, non weather adjusted basis.FPL can vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in 2010 of $267 million, a cap in subsequent years of $267 million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years, and a total cap of $776 million (surplus depreciation credit cap) over the course of the 2010 rate agreement, provided that in any year of the 2010 rate agreement, FPL must use at least enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain a 9% earned regulatory ROE but may not use any amount of surplus depreciation credit that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11%. In 2010 and 2011, FPL used a total of $191 million of surplus depreciation credit; $585 million of the surplus depreciation credit cap remains available for use in 2012.Under the terms of the 2005 rate agreement, which was in effect from January 1, 2006 through February 28, 2010, retail base rates did not increase except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of FPLs three power plants that achieved commercial operation during the term of the 2005 rate agreement: Turkey Point Unit No. 5 in 2007 and WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2 in 2009. Under the terms of the 2005 rate agreement, FPLs electric property depreciation rates were based upon the comprehensive depreciation studies it filed with the FPSC in March 2005; however, FPL reduced depreciation on its plant in service by $125 million each year as allowed by the 2005 rate agreement. The 2005 rate agreement also provided for a revenue sharing mechanism, whereby revenues from retail base operations in excess of certain thresholds would be shared with customers. During the term of the 2005 rate agreement, FPLs revenues did not exceed the thresholds.Retail Customer Usage and GrowthFor the year ended December 31, 2011, FPL experienced a 2% decrease in average usage per retail customer, reflecting weather and other factors, which decreased retail base revenues by approximately $107 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, FPL experienced a 1.7% increase in usage per retail customer, reflecting weather and other factors, which increased retail base revenues by approximately $79 million. The usage per retail customer data for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes three extra days of sales after adjusting for a change from a fiscal month to a calendar month. At December 31, 2011, inactive accounts (accounts with installed meters without corresponding customer names) and low usage customers (customers using less than 200 kwh per month), both measures of empty homes, were approximately 5.8% and 1.6% less, respectively, than they had been at December 31, 2010. Non weather related usage per retail customer began to decline in the mid 2000s and this decline intensified in the 2007 to 2009 period. The rate of decline in non weather related usage per retail customer moderated in 2010 and 2011.For the year ended December 31, 2011, FPL experienced a 0.6% increase in the average number of customer accounts, increasing retail base revenues by approximately $25 million, compared to a 0.5% increase in customer accounts in 2010, which increased 2010 retail base revenues by $19 million. Positive customer account growth is projected to continue in 2012, although the rate of growth is projected to be below FPLs average rate of 1.5% over the last 10 years.FPL believes that the economic slowdown and the downturn in the housing market that have affected the country and the state of Florida have contributed to the slowdown in customer growth and to the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer. The unemployment rate in Florida was 9.9% and 12.0% in December 2011 and 2010, respectively; the December 2011 rate is the lowest since April 2009. A portion of the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer may also be related to federal and state energy efficiency standards. FPL is unable to predict whether or when growth in customers and non weather related customer usage might return to previous trends.Cost Recovery ClausesIn 2011, 2010 and 2009, cost recovery clauses contributed $108 million, $75 million, $41 million, respectively, to FPLs net income. The increase in 2011 and 2010 cost recovery clause results is primarily due to a return related to additional solar, environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures. In 2012, it is expected that cost recovery clauses will contribute higher earnings for FPL as a result of additional nuclear capacity expenditures. Fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense in the consolidated statements of income, as well as by changes in energy sales. Fluctuations in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs are primarily driven by changes in storm related surcharges, capacity charges, franchise fee costs, the impact of changes in O&M and depreciation expenses on the underlying cost recovery clause, investment in solar and environmental projects, investment in nuclear capacity until such capacity goes into service, pre construction costs associated with the development of two additional nuclear units at the Turkey Point site and changes in energy sales. Capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes and other, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income.46Table of ContentsRisk Management Fuel Procurement ProgramFPL uses a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the FPSC. The FPSC reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs. The program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPLs fuel requirements. The current regulatory asset for the change in fair value of derivative instruments used in the fuel procurement program amounted to approximately $502 million and $236 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.In 2010, pursuant to an FPSC order, FPL was required to refund in the form of a one time credit to retail customers bills the 2009 year end estimated fuel overrecovery; during the first quarter of 2010, approximately $404 million was refunded to retail customers. At December 31, 2009, approximately $356 million of retail fuel revenues were overrecovered, the reversal of which is reflected in the net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues caption included in the table above. The difference between the refund and the December 31, 2009 overrecovery was collected from retail customers in 2011. The increase in fuel revenues in 2011 reflects the absence of the $404 million refund partly offset by approximately $41 million related to lower energy sales and $37 million related to a lower average fuel factor. The decrease in fuel revenues in 2010 reflects the $404 million refund and approximately $1,573 million related to a lower average fuel factor, partly offset by $85 million attributable to higher energy sales. The decrease from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 in deferred clause and franchise expenses and in deferred clause and franchise revenues was approximately $181 million and positively affected NEEs and FPLs cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011.OtherThe decrease in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs in 2010 is primarily due to lower revenues associated with the FPSCs nuclear cost recovery rule and lower revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes, partly offset by higher environmental clause revenues. The decline in 2010 in revenues associated with the nuclear cost recovery rule is primarily due to lower spending related to the development of the two additional nuclear units at the Turkey Point site. The decline in 2010 revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes reflects the decline in fuel revenues. The nuclear cost recovery rule provides for the recovery of prudently incurred pre construction costs and carrying charges (equal to a pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through levelized charges under the capacity clause. The same rule provides for the recovery of construction costs, once property related to the new nuclear capacity goes into service, through a base rate increase effective beginning the following January.Other Items Impacting FPL ResultsFuel, Purchased Power and InterchangeThe major components of FPLs fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) Fuel and energy charges during the period$4,237 $4,714 $5,425Net collection of previously deferred retail fuel costs 159 256Net deferral of retail fuel costs (276) Other, primarily capacity charges, net of any capacity deferral 581 544 539Total$4,977 $4,982 $6,220The decrease in fuel and energy charges in 2011 reflects lower fuel and energy prices of $415 million and lower energy sales of $62 million. The decrease in fuel and energy charges in 2010 reflects lower fuel and energy prices of approximately $822 million, partly offset by approximately $111 million attributable to higher energy sales.O&M ExpensesFPLs O&M expenses increased $79 million in 2011 primarily due to higher cost recovery clause costs which did not significantly affect net income.FPLs O&M expenses increased $124 million in 2010 reflecting an approximately $20 million charge for workforce reductions and higher nuclear and fossil generation, distribution, transmission and nuclear insurance costs of $34 million, $29 million, $16 million, $8 million and $12 million, respectively, partly offset by lower customer service costs, primarily due to lower uncollectible accounts, of $13 million. The increase in nuclear generation costs is primarily due to higher maintenance costs and reflects a reimbursement in 2009 of prior years costs of approximately $10 million related to a spent nuclear fuel litigation settlement agreement with the U.S. Government. The increase in fossil generation costs is primarily related to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, which units were placed in service in the second half of 2009, and higher plant overhaul costs. The increase in distribution and transmission costs reflects higher restoration and tree trimming costs. Other changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income.47Table of ContentsDepreciation and Amortization ExpenseThe major components of FPLs depreciation and amortization expense are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) $125 million annual reduction under the 2005 rate agreement$ $ $(125)Surplus depreciation credit recorded under the 2010 rate agreement(187) (4) Other depreciation and amortization recovered under base rates944 891 942Depreciation and amortization recovered under cost recovery clauses and securitized storm recovery cost amortization41 121 280Total$798 $1,008 $1,097From 2002 through 2009, FPL recorded the $125 million annual reduction in depreciation and amortization expense that was approved by the FPSC in previous rate orders. Under the terms of the 2010 rate agreement, FPL can vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in 2010 of $267 million, a cap in subsequent years of $267 million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years, and a cap of $776 million (surplus depreciation credit cap) over the 2010 to 2012 period. In any year of the 2010 rate agreement FPL must use at least enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain a 9% earned regulatory ROE but may not use any amount of surplus depreciation credit that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11%. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $585 million of the surplus depreciation credit cap remains available for use in 2012. The increase in other depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in 2011 is primarily due to higher plant in service balances. The decline in other depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in 2010 is primarily due to lower depreciation rates as a result of the FPSC rate order, partly offset by higher plant in service balances related to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, which were placed in service in 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization recovered under cost recovery clauses and securitized storm recovery cost amortization in 2011 and 2010 is primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization under the FPSCs nuclear cost recovery rule. See Note 1 Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization.Taxes Other Than Income Taxes and OtherTaxes other than income taxes and other increased $37 million in 2011 primarily due to higher franchise fees and revenue taxes, both of which are pass through costs and reflect the increase in revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs. Taxes other than income taxes and other decreased by $71 million in 2010 primarily due to changes in franchise fees and revenue taxes. In addition, taxes other than income taxes and other in 2011 and 2010 reflect higher property taxes of $5 million and $34 million, respectively, primarily due to growth in plant in service balances and, in 2010, a higher average property tax rate, partly offset in 2011 by a lower average property tax rate.Interest ExpenseThe increase in interest expense in 2011 is primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances. The increase in interest expense in 2010 is primarily due to higher average debt balances, as well as lower AFUDC debt. Interest expense on storm recovery bonds, as well as certain other interest expense (collectively, clause interest), are essentially pass through amounts and do not significantly affect net income, as the clause interest is recovered either under cost recovery clause mechanisms or through a storm recovery bond surcharge. Clause interest for 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately $65 million, $56 million, and $45 million, respectively. The increase in clause interest in 2011 and 2010 is primarily due to higher interest associated with solar, environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures.AFUDC EquityThe decrease in AFUDC equity in 2010 is primarily attributable to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, which units commenced commercial operation in 2009, partly offset by additional AFUDC equity on WCEC Unit No. 3. The decrease in AFUDC equity in 2010 also reflects a decline, effective April 1, 2010, in the AFUDC rate from 7.41% to 6.41%, as approved by the FPSC.48Table of ContentsNEER: Results of OperationsNEERs net income for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $774 million, $980 million and $759 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease in 2011 of $206 million and an increase in 2010 of $221 million. The primary drivers, on an after tax basis, of these changes were as follows: Increase (Decrease)From Prior Period Years EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 (millions)New investments(a)$(26) $45 Existing assets(a)26 54 Gas infrastructure(b)23 23 Customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses(b)(92) (25) Asset sales(18) 7 Impairment charges(20) (11) Interest expense, differential membership costs and other(14) (85) Change in unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity(c)(d)17 196 Loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets(e)(92) Change in OTTI losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds, net of OTTI reversals(d)(10) 17 Net income increase (decrease)$(206) $221 (a)Includes PTCs and state ITCs on wind projects and, for new investments, deferred income tax and other benefits associated with convertible ITCs (see Note 1 Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, Note 1 Income Taxes, Note 1 Sale of Differential Membership Interests and Note 6) but does not include allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. Results from new projects are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation. A projects results are included in existing assets beginning with the thirteenth month of operation.(b)Does not include allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses.(c)See Note 3 and Overview related to derivative instruments.(d)See table in Overview for additional detail.(e)See Note 4 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements and Overview for additional information.New InvestmentsResults from new investments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 include approximately $1 million, $66 million and $87 million, respectively, of deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs. In addition, an after tax benefit associated with convertible ITCs of approximately $34 million was recorded in 2011 from the sale of membership interests where the investors elected to receive the convertible ITCs related to the underlying wind projects; the pretax amount of such benefit was recorded in taxes other than income taxes and other in NEEs consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Results from new investments in 2011 also reflect lower state ITCs partly offset by the addition of approximately 1,130 mw of wind and 5 mw of solar generation during or after 2010. NEERs 2010 results from new investments also reflect the addition of over 2,100 mw of wind generation during or after 2009 and a benefit related to state ITCs.Existing AssetsIn 2011, results from NEERs existing asset portfolio increased $26 million primarily due to:lower after tax depreciation and amortization expense of $44 million due to a change in estimate of the useful lives of certain equipment across the wind portfolio (see Note 1 Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization),higher wind results of approximately $35 million due to a higher wind resource partly offset by lower prices,a $30 million income tax benefit related to a valuation allowance reversal for certain state ITCs reflecting state tax planning initiatives,higher results of $23 million from a natural gas fired project in California, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting higher prices under a new long term contract,partly offset by,lower results at Seabrook of $91 million primarily due to extended and unplanned outages in 2011 and lower priced hedges, andthe expiration of PTCs ($15 million) on certain projects after ten years of production.In 2010, results from NEERs existing asset portfolio increased $54 million primarily due to:favorable results at Seabrook of approximately $62 million resulting primarily from the absence of an extended outage in 2010,favorable generation due to lower curtailments and a higher wind resource across the wind portfolio totaling $46 million,49Table of Contentspartly offset by,unfavorable market conditions in the ERCOT market affecting NEERs merchant gas assets totaling $30 million, andthe absence of a tax benefit of $15 million recorded in 2009 related to a change in state tax law that extended the carry forward period of ITCs on certain wind projects.Gas InfrastructureThe increase in gas infrastructure results in 2011 and 2010 is primarily due to exiting the hedged positions on a number of future gas drilling opportunities.Customer Supply and Proprietary Power and Gas TradingResults from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses decreased in 2011 by $92 million primarily due to lower full requirements results, lower power and gas trading results, lower results from the retail electricity provider reflecting the adverse effects of purchasing power at high prices during a period of hot weather in Texas in August 2011 and the absence of a gain on the sale of a power supply contract realized in 2010. In 2010, results from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses decreased by $25 million, primarily due to lower power and gas trading results, partly offset by the gain from the sale of the power supply contract.Asset SalesAsset sales in 2011 include an after tax loss of $92 million realized on the sale of natural gas fired generating assets, which due to its nature and significance was excluded from adjusted earnings (see Overview). Asset sales in 2010 include an after tax gain of approximately $6 million on the sale of a coal fired project and an after tax gain on a waste to energy project of approximately $12 million recorded in 2010 after the expiration of an option for the buyer to sell the project back to NEER. Asset sales in 2009 include after tax gains of $3 million for the sale of wind development rights, $6 million for the sale of a 50 mw wind project and $2 million for the sale of an interest in the waste to energy project.Impairment ChargesIn 2011, NEER recorded impairment charges primarily to write down the value of certain wind and oil fired generation assets deemed to be unrecoverable. As a result of a fair value analysis, long lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of approximately $79 million were written down to their fair value of $28 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $51 million or $31 million after tax. See Note 4 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements. In 2010, NEER recorded impairment charges of $19 million or $11 million after tax to write down the value of certain assets associated with the plans to repower two California wind facilities. These impairment charges are reported as a separate line item in NEEs consolidated statements of income.Interest Expense, Differential Membership Costs and OtherIn both 2011 and 2010, interest expense, differential membership costs and other reflects higher interest and other costs due to growth of the business and, for 2010, also reflects the absence of an $18 million income tax benefit recorded in 2009 due to a reduction of previously deferred income taxes resulting from an additional equity investment in Canadian operations.Other FactorsIn addition to the primary drivers of the changes in net income discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEEs consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER.Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $134 million primarily due to:lower revenues at PMI, reflecting lower trading and full requirements activity, and the existing asset portfolio, primarily due to the extended and unplanned outages at Seabrook and unfavorable market conditions in the NEPOOL and ERCOT regions (collectively, approximately $763 million),partly offset by,unrealized mark to market gains of $414 million from non qualifying hedges compared to $75 million of losses on such hedges in 2010, andhigher revenues from project additions of $132 million.Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $639 million primarily due to:higher revenues at PMI and NEERs retail electricity provider (collectively, approximately $242 million),higher revenues in the existing asset portfolio of $206 million primarily due to the absence of an extended outage in 2010 at Seabrook,higher revenues from project additions of $143 million,50Table of Contentshigher gas infrastructure revenues of $31 million,favorable generation due to lower curtailments and a higher wind resource across the wind portfolio, andlosses of $75 million on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity compared to $88 million of such losses in 2009.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $53 million primarily due to:lower fuel costs of approximately $445 million, andhigher benefits associated with differential membership interests of $102 million,partly offset by,$95 million of unrealized mark to market losses from non qualifying hedges compared to $364 million of gains on such hedges in 2010, andhigher impairment charges of $32 million.Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $262 million primarily due to:higher fuel costs of approximately $366 million,higher other operating expenses of $130 million due to higher maintenance activities, impairment charges associated with the plans to repower two California wind facilities and additional wells in gas infrastructure,higher costs for project additions of approximately $85 million,partly offset by,$364 million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to $60 million of such gains in 2009.Interest ExpenseNEERs interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 increased $15 million and $55 million, respectively, primarily due to increased borrowings to support the growth of the business, partly offset by lower average interest rates and, in 2011, higher interest capitalized on construction projects.Gains on Disposal of Assets netGains on disposal of assets net in NEEs consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 primarily reflect gains on sales of securities held in NEERs nuclear decommissioning funds and, in 2010, also reflect a pretax gain of $18 million on the sale of the waste to energy project.Tax Credits and BenefitsPTCs from NEERs wind projects are reflected in NEERs earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, and were approximately $271 million, $307 million and $255 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, NEEs effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was affected by deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs of $2 million, $68 million and $88 million, respectively. See Note 6.Corporate and Other: Results of OperationsCorporate and Other is primarily comprised of interest expense, the operating results of FPL FiberNet, Lone Star and other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates non utility interest expense and shared service costs to NEER. Interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and, for purposes of allocating non utility interest expense, the deferred credit associated with differential membership interests sold by NEERs subsidiaries is included with debt. Each subsidiarys income taxes are calculated based on the separate return method, except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at Corporate and Other. The major components of Corporate and Others results, on an after tax basis, are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) Interest expense, net of allocations to NEER$(72) $(63) $(43)Interest income32 43 34Federal and state income tax benefits91 35 Other30 17 34Net income$81 $32 $2551Table of ContentsThe increase in interest expense in 2011 and 2010 reflects additional debt outstanding, partly offset by lower average interest rates and, in 2010, a higher allocation of interest costs to NEER. The decline in interest income in 2011 is primarily due to lower interest recorded on unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service in 2011. See Note 6 Unrecognized Tax Benefits. The increase in interest income in 2010 is primarily due to earnings on an energy related loan made to a third party by a NEECH subsidiary. The federal and state income tax benefits reflect consolidating income tax adjustments and include the following the items:in 2011, a state deferred income tax benefit of approximately $64 million, net of federal income taxes, related to state tax law changes,in 2011, an income tax benefit of $41 million related to the dissolution of a subsidiary, in 2011, a $6 million expense associated with the loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets, andin 2010, an income tax benefit of $24 million related to employee benefits.Other includes all other corporate income and expenses, as well as other business activities. The decline in other in 2010 is primarily due to an $11 million after tax loss on the sale of assets held under leveraged leases; the pretax amount ($17 million) of such loss is reflected in other net in NEEs consolidated statements of income.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESNEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, payment of maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flow from operations, short and long term borrowings, and the issuance, from time to time, of short and long term debt and equity securities, consistent with NEEs and FPLs objective of maintaining, on a long term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short and long term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.Cash FlowsSources and uses of NEEs and FPLs cash for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: NEE FPL Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (millions)Sources of cash: Cash flows from operating activities$4,074 $3,834 $4,463 $2,245 $1,934 $2,871Long term borrowings, net of loan proceeds restricted for construction3,375 3,724 3,220 840 924 516Proceeds from the sale of differential membership interests, net of payments to investors366 261 Sale of natural gas fired generating assets1,204 Capital contribution from NEE 410 660 Cash grants under the Recovery Act624 588 100 218 161 Issuances of common stock net48 308 198 Net increase in short term debt460 154 229 45Other sources205 76 102 89 65 76Total sources of cash10,356 8,791 8,237 4,031 3,744 3,508Uses of cash: Capital expenditures and independent power and other investments and nuclear fuel purchases(6,628) (5,846) (6,006) (3,502) (2,706) (2,717)Retirements of long term debt(2,121) (769) (1,635) (45) (42) (263)Net decrease in short term debt (1,130) (717) Dividends(920) (823) (766) (400) (250) (485)Repurchases of common stock(375) Other uses(237) (159) (127) (68) (92) (80)Total uses of cash(10,281) (8,727) (8,534) (4,015) (3,807) (3,545)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$75 $64 $(297) $16 $(63) $(37)52Table of ContentsNEEs primary capital requirements are for expanding and enhancing FPLs electric system and generating facilities to continue to provide reliable service to meet customer electricity demands and for NEERs investments in independent power and other projects. The following table provides a summary of the major capital investments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

The NEER subsidiary has ownership interests in a wind generation facility with generating capacity totaling approximately 662 mw located in Texas.LiquidityOn February 9, 2012, FPL and NEECH refinanced a portion of their bank revolving line of credit facilities. The table below provides the components of FPLs and NEECHs estimated total net available liquidity as of that date.

The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes, including to provide back up liquidity for FPLs and NEECHs commercial paper programs and other short term borrowings and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies or their subsidiaries operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPLs bank revolving line of credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $633 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds (tax exempt bonds) in the event they are tendered by individual bond holders and not remarketed prior to maturity.(b)Approximately $4 million and $1,114 million of FPLs bank revolving line of credit facilities expire in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Approximately $10 million and $1,469 million of NEECHs bank revolving line of credit facilities expire in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The remaining portion of bank revolving line of credit facilities for FPL and NEECH expires in 2017.(c)As of January 31, 2012.53Table of ContentsAs of February 27, 2012, 62 banks participate in FPLs and NEECHs bank revolving line of credit facilities and FPLs revolving credit facility, with no one bank providing more than 5% of the combined bank revolving line of credit facilities and FPLs revolving credit facility. European banks provide approximately 35% of the combined bank revolving line of credit facilities and FPLs revolving credit facility. Pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement, NEE guarantees the payment of NEECHs debt obligations under the bank revolving line of credit facilities. In order for FPL or NEECH to borrow or to have letters of credit issued under the terms of their respective bank revolving line of credit facilities and FPLs revolving credit facility, FPL, in the case of FPL, and NEE, in the case of the NEECH, are required, among other things, to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL and NEECH bank revolving line of credit facilities and FPL revolving credit facility also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL and NEE, as the case may be, to maintain the respective ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. At December 31, 2011, each of NEE and FPL was in compliance with its required ratio.Additionally, at December 31, 2011, certain subsidiaries of NEE had credit or loan facilities with available liquidity as follows: OriginalAmount AmountRemainingAvailable atDecember 31, 2011 Rate MaturityDate RelatedProject Use (millions) NEECH and NEER: Canadian bank revolving credit agreements(a)C$300 $121 Variable 2013 Canadian renewable generating assetsRevolving loan agreement(a)170 $175 Variable 2014 Construction of Spain solar projectNEER: Senior secured limited recourse loan agreement(b)(c)589 $485 Variable 2030 Construction of Spain solar projectTerm loan facility(b)(c)$150 $150 Variable 2019 Construction of Genesis solar projectLone Star: Senior secured limited recourse loan agreement(b)(d)$387 $279 Variable 2016 Construction of Lone Star transmission line and substations (a)Includes as a precondition to borrowing or issuing letters of credit as well as default and related acceleration provisions that require NEEs ratio of funded debt to total capitalization to not exceed a stated ratio.

The total equity funding commitment and, until certain conditions or obligations related to the project are met, certain obligations, including all or a portion of the debt payment obligations, are guaranteed by NEECH, which guarantee obligations are in turn guaranteed by NEE. The related NEECH guarantee contains default and acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, NEEs ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding a specified ratio.(d)Borrowings are preconditioned on equity being contributed by Lone Stars parent, and are drawn on a pro rata basis with those equity contributions. The total equity funding commitment has been guaranteed by NEECH, which guarantee obligations are in turn guaranteed by NEE. The related NEECH guarantee contains default provisions and related provisions for acceleration of the unfunded equity commitment relating to, among other things, NEEs ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding a specified ratio.Storm Restoration CostsAt December 31, 2011, FPL had the capacity to absorb up to approximately $202 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking recovery through a rate adjustment from the FPSC or filing a petition with the FPSC. See Note 1 Revenue and Rates.Dodd Frank ActThe Dodd Frank Act, enacted into law in July 2010, among other things, provides for the regulation of the OTC derivatives market. The Dodd Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain OTC derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. While the legislation is broad and detailed, substantial portions of the legislation require implementing rules to be adopted by federal governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the SEC and the CFTC. While some provisions of the statute related to OTC derivatives are currently in effect or have been finalized, the majority of the rules are expected to be finalized and implemented in 2012. NEE and FPL cannot predict the impact of the final rules that will be adopted to implement the OTC derivative related provisions of the Dodd Frank Act. Those rules could negatively affect NEEs and FPLs ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risks, which could have a material effect on NEEs and FPLs risk exposure and financial results. The rules also could cause NEER to decide to restructure part of its energy marketing and trading operations or to discontinue certain portions of that business. In addition, if the rules require NEE and FPL to post significant amounts of cash collateral with respect to swap transactions, NEEs and FPLs liquidity could be materially affected, and their ability to enter into OTC derivatives 54Table of Contentsto hedge commodity and interest rate risks could be significantly limited. Reporting and compliance requirements of the rules also could significantly increase operating costs and expose NEE and FPL to penalties for any failure to comply with the new requirements. The financial and operational impact of the final rules cannot be determined at this time, but could be material.Capital SupportLetters of Credit, Surety Bonds and GuaranteesNEE and FPL obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. Letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees support, among other things, the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities, debt and related reserves, nuclear activities, capital expenditures for wind and solar development and other contractual agreements.In addition, as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business, NEE and FPL may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may include, but are not limited to, an adverse judgment in a lawsuit, the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law or the non receipt of renewable tax credits or proceeds from cash grants under the Recovery Act. NEE and FPL are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence.In addition, NEE has guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications, and NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of NEER and its subsidiaries. See Note 14 Commitments.At December 31, 2011, NEE had approximately $1.4 billion of standby letters of credit ($40 million for FPL), approximately $160 million of surety bonds ($56 million for FPL) and approximately $14.5 billion notional amount of guarantees and indemnifications ($25 million for FPL), of which approximately $9.2 billion ($45 million for FPL) letters of credit, guarantees and indemnifications have expiration dates within the next five years. An aggregate of approximately $1.3 billion ($34 million for FPL) of the standby letters of credit at December 31, 2011 were issued under FPLs and NEECHs credit facilities. Each of NEE and FPL believe it is unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and indemnifications. Accordingly, at December 31, 2011, NEE and FPL did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and indemnifications.Shelf RegistrationIn August 2009, NEE, NEECH, FPL and certain affiliated trusts filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities which became effective upon filing. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors. As of February 27, 2012, securities that may be issued under the registration statement include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, preferred trust securities, common stock, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities. As of February 27, 2012, NEE and NEECH had approximately $2.3 billion (issuable by either or both of them up to such aggregate amount) of board authorized available capacity, and FPL had $750 million of board authorized available capacity.Contractual Obligations and Estimated Planned Capital ExpendituresNEEs and FPLs commitments at December 31, 2011 were as follows:55Table of Contents 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (millions)Long term debt, including interest:(a) FPL$428 $818 $409 $410 $411 $13,476(b) $15,952NEER729 958 986 707 677 4,317 8,374Corporate and Other739 1,697 1,531 1,610 405 12,580 18,562Purchase obligations: FPL(c)5,985 3,810 2,900 2,545 2,295 9,415 26,950NEER(d)1,970 475 140 110 100 520 3,315Corporate and Other(e)250 15 265Asset retirement activities:(f) FPL(g) 7,106 7,106NEER(h)2 11,564 11,566Other Commitments: NEER(i)142 76 78 103 115 557 1,071Total$10,245 $7,849 $6,044 $5,485 $4,003 $59,535 $93,161 (a)Includes principal, interest and interest rate swaps.

In the event bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL would be required to purchase the tax exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2011, all tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase have been successfully remarketed. FPLs bank revolving line of credit facilities are available to support the purchase of tax exempt bonds.(c)Represents required capacity and minimum charges under long term purchased power and fuel contracts (see Note 14 Contracts), and projected capital expenditures through 2016 (see Note 14 Commitments).(d)Represents firm commitments primarily in connection with construction activities and fuel related contracts.

See Note 13.(i)Represents estimated cash distributions related to membership interests and payments related to the acquisition of certain development rights.

At February 27, 2012, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to NEE, FPL and NEECH: Moodys(a) S&P(a) Fitch(a)NEE:(b) Corporate credit ratingBaa1 A A FPL:(b) Corporate credit ratingA2 A AFirst mortgage bondsAa3 A AA Pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bondsVMIG 1 A A+Commercial paperP 1 A 2 F1 NEECH:(b) Corporate credit ratingBaa1 A A DebenturesBaa1 BBB+ A Junior subordinated debenturesBaa2 BBB BBBCommercial paperP 2 A 2 F1 (a)A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.(b)The outlook indicated by each of Moodys, S&P and Fitch is stable.56Table of ContentsNEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities noted above, with the exception of the Spain senior secured limited recourse loan facility, the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities.Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short term debt issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities. In addition, a ratings downgrade could result in the requirement that NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, post collateral under certain agreements, including those related to fuel procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding, debt related reserves and trading activities. FPLs and NEECHs credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements.CovenantsNEEs charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of NEE to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. For example, FPL pays dividends to NEE in a manner consistent with FPLs long term targeted capital structure. However, the mortgage securing FPLs first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to NEE and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. Additionally, in some circumstances, the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPLs use of retained earnings. As of December 31, 2011, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage and in light of FPLs current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations.FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPLs first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior FPL indebtedness. As of December 31, 2011, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 would have been approximately 6.5 times the annual interest requirements and approximately 3.6 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. As of December 31, 2011, FPL could have issued in excess of $8.9 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.8 billion based on retired first mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2011, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes.In September 2006, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (September 2006 RCC) in connection with NEECHs offering of $350 million principal amount of Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 and $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (collectively, Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long term indebtedness (covered debt) of NEECH (other than the Series A and Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. FPL Group Capital Trust Is 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the September 2006 RCC.

Critical accounting policies are those that NEE and FPL believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.NEE and FPL consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statements:Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging ActivitiesNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with outstanding and forecasted debt issuances. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.Nature of Accounting EstimatesAccounting pronouncements require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. This applies not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. Much of the existing accounting guidance related to derivatives focuses on when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from derivative accounting rules, however the guidance does not address all contract issues. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts. In the event changes in interpretation occur, it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income.Assumptions and Accounting ApproachNEEs and FPLs derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are derived through internally developed models which estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. The near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. NEE estimates the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives using a discounted cash flows valuation 58Table of Contentstechnique based on the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the derivative agreements. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause. See Note 3.In NEEs non rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases and sales are recognized on a net basis in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEEs consolidated statements of income, unless the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge.For those transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges, much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in OCI, a component of common shareholders equity, rather than being recognized in current earnings. For those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges, the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged.Certain hedging transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or hedge accounting treatment is not elected. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings. This could be significant to NEERs results because the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market (such as the physical assets from which power is generated) are not marked to market. As a consequence, net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions. For this reason, NEEs management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity.Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement BenefitsNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. NEE also has a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) which includes a non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees. The impact of the SERP component is included within the pension plan as discussed below. Management believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future.In addition to pension benefits, NEE sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits (other benefits plan) for retirees of NEE and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan. The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance. NEE allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.Nature of Accounting EstimatesFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including estimates of the average life of employees/survivors and average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. For the other benefits plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the December 31 measurement date of all future benefits attributed under the terms of the other benefits plan to employee service rendered to that date. NEE derives pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan from actuarial calculations based on each plans provisions and managements assumptions regarding discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on plan assets and, in the case of the other benefits plan, health care cost trend rates.Assumptions and Accounting ApproachNEEs regulatory assets and liabilities are established in association with accounting guidance which requires recognition of the funded status of benefit plans in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in comprehensive income within shareholders equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in AOCI are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory 59Table of Contentstreatment.Pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions include:an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all years for the pension plan and 8.00% for all years for the other benefits plan,assumed increases in salary of 4.00% for all years,weighted average discount rates of 5.00%, 5.50%, and 6.90% for the pension plan and 5.25%, 5.50%, and 6.90% for the other benefits plan for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, andhealth care cost trend rates (as related to other benefits) for those under age 65 of 7.60% for medical and 8.20% for prescription drug benefits and for those age 65 and over of 7.25% for medical and 7.75% for prescription drug benefits. These rates are assumed to decrease over the next 7 years for medical benefits and 9 years for prescription drug benefits to the ultimate trend rate of 5.50% and remain at that level thereafter. The ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in 2018 for medical benefits and 2020 for prescription drug benefits.In developing these assumptions, NEE evaluated input from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. For the expected long term rate of return on fund assets, NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds, as well as its funds historical compounded returns. NEE also considered input, including other qualitative and quantitative factors, from its actuaries and consultants as well as information available in the marketplace. NEE believes that 7.75% and 8.00% are reasonable long term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets, respectively. NEE will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as necessary.NEE bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, as prescribed by accounting guidance. This market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period following the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension income and other benefits plan expense only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets.The following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant: Increase (Decrease) in 2011Net Periodic Benefit Income Change inAssumption NEE FPLExpected long term rate of return(0.5)% $(16) $(11) Discount rate(0.5)% $2 $1 Salary increase0.5 % $(2) $(1) Health care cost trend rate(a)1.0 % $ $ (a)Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits. However, this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in NEEs other benefits plan.See Note 2.Carrying Value of Long Lived AssetsNEE evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.Nature of Accounting EstimatesThe amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized.60Table of ContentsAssumptions and Accounting ApproachAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the assets fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. See Note 4 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil/Solar DismantlementThe components of NEEs and FPLs decommissioning of nuclear plants, dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs are as follows: FPL NuclearDecommissioning Fossil/SolarDismantlement Interim RemovalCosts and Other NEER NEE December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 (millions)AROs$1,114 $1,057 $27 $23 $3 $3 $467 $556 $1,611 $1,639Less capitalized ARO asset net of accumulated depreciation 7 4 7 4Accrued asset removal costs(a)216 207 337 336 1,644 1,701 2,197 2,244Asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference(a)1,618 1,571 23 22 (1) (1) 1,640 1,592Accrued decommissioning, dismantlement and other accrued asset removal costs$2,948(b) $2,835(b) $380(b) $377(b) $1,646(b) $1,703(b) $467 $556 $5,441 $5,471 (a)Regulatory liability on NEEs and FPLs consolidated balance sheets.(b)Represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes.Nature of Accounting EstimatesThe calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and fossil and solar dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, NEE and FPL also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, NEE and FPL are required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates would increase NEEs and FPLs asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) as of December 31, 2011 by $126 million and $87 million, respectively.Assumptions and Accounting ApproachNEE and FPL each account for AROs under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets.FPL For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the FPSC at least every five years. The studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPLs nuclear units. The most recent studies, filed in 2010, indicate that FPLs portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under the spent fuel settlement agreement, is approximately $6.2 billion, or $2.3 billion expressed in 2011 dollars.FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies became effective January 1, 2010. At December 31, 2011, FPLs portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately $860 million, or $421 million expressed in 2011 dollars. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered AROs. FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. Any differences between the ARO amount recorded and the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting.61Table of ContentsNEER NEER records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs which is determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning. The liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At December 31, 2011, the ARO for nuclear decommissioning of NEERs nuclear plants totaled approximately $383 million. NEERs portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under the spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $11.4 billion, or $1.9 billion expressed in 2011 dollars.See Note 1 Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 1 Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 13.Regulatory AccountingNEEs and FPLs regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows: NEE FPL December 31, December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010Regulatory assets:(millions)Current: Deferred clause and franchise expenses$112 $368 $112 $368Derivatives$502 $236 $502 $236Other$84 $82 $80 $76Noncurrent: Securitized storm recovery costs$517 $581 $517 $581Other$621 $329 $395 $293Regulatory liabilities: Current, included in other current liabilities$21 $52 $24 $47Noncurrent: Accrued asset removal costs$2,197 $2,244 $2,197 $2,244Asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference$1,640 $1,592 $1,640 $1,592Other$419 $423 $416 $377Nature of Accounting EstimatesRegulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. All regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during the recovery period.Assumptions and Accounting ApproachAccounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities. If FPL were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period. See Note 1 for a discussion of NEEs and FPLs other significant accounting policies.Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk SensitivityNEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices and currency exchange rates. Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices or currency exchange rates over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.62Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.

The EMC and NEEs chief executive officer receive periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities.NEE uses a value at risk (VaR) model to measure commodity price market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the VaR figures are as follows: Trading Non Qualifying Hedgesand Hedges in OCI andFPL Cost Recovery Clauses(a) Total FPL NEER NEE FPL NEER NEE FPL NEER NEE (millions) December 31, 2010$ $3 $3 $51 $21 $35 $51 $23 $36December 31, 2011$ $2 $2 $38 $50 $25 $38 $50 $26Average for the period ended December 31, 2011$ $3 $3 $46 $43 $37 $46 $43 $37 (a)Non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI and FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements.Interest Rate RiskNEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt, investments in special use funds and other investments. NEE and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate swaps and using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest rate swaps are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements.64Table of ContentsThe following are estimates of the fair value of NEEs and FPLs financial instruments: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value (millions) NEE: Fixed income securities: Special use funds$1,897 $1,897(a) $1,701 $1,701(a) Other investments: Debt securities$89 $89(a) $114 $114(a) Notes receivable$503 $535(b) $525 $583(b) Long term debt, including current maturities$21,614 $23,699(c) $19,929 $20,756(c) Interest rate swaps net unrealized losses$(283) $(283)(d) $(16) $(16)(d) FPL: Fixed income securities special use funds$1,499 $1,499(a) $1,375 $1,375(a) Long term debt, including current maturities$7,533 $9,078(c) $6,727 $7,236(c) (a)Based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues.(b)Based on market prices provided by external sources.(c)Provided by external sources based on market prices indicative of market conditions.(d)Modeled internally based on market values using discounted cash flow analysis and credit valuation adjustment.The special use funds of NEE and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of NEEs and FPLs nuclear power plants. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value. At FPL, changes in fair value, including any OTTI losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The changes in fair value of NEEs non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary, including any credit losses, which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer term securities, as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin until at least 2030 (2032 at FPL).65Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value for NEEs interest rate swaps was as follows:NotionalAmount EffectiveDate MaturityDate RatePaid RateReceived EstimatedFair Value(millions) (millions)Fair value hedges NEECH: $250 May 2010 November 2013 Variable(a) 2.55% $6$400 August 2010 September 2015 Variable(b) 2.60% 11$250 August 2011 June 2013 Variable(c) 5.35% (1)$500 August 2011 December 2015 Variable(d) 7.875% (2)$500 August 2011 March 2019 Variable(e) 6.00% 6$400 August 2011 June 2021 Variable(f) 4.50% 12Total fair value hedges32Cash flow hedges: NEER: $32 December 2003 December 2017 4.245% Variable(g) (3)$10 April 2004 December 2017 3.845% Variable(g) (1)$130 December 2005 November 2019 4.905% Variable(g) (14)$336 January 2007 January 2022 5.390% Variable(h) (40)$292 January 2009 December 2016 2.680% Variable(g) (17)$124 January 2009(i) December 2023 3.725% Variable(g) (3)$78 January 2009 December 2023 2.578% Variable(j) (3)$17 March 2009 December 2016 2.655% Variable(g) (1)$7 March 2009(i) December 2023 3.960% Variable(g) $282 May 2009 May 2017 3.015% Variable(g) (20)$106 May 2009(i) May 2024 4.663% Variable(g) (4)$239 April 2010 January 2027 4.040% Variable(h) (37)$275 October 2010 September 2028 2.822% Variable(g) (18)$255 April 2011 December 2013 2.733% Variable(k) (18)$764 April 2011(i) June 2018 4.042% Variable(l) (54)$632 April 2011(i) December 2030 4.694% Variable(l) (53)$70 August 2011 January 2016 (m) Variable(g) $216 December 2011 December 2029 2.275% Variable(g) (5)NEECH: $250 October 2010(i) June 2023 3.479% Variable(g) (24)Total cash flow hedges(315)Total interest rate swaps$(283) (a)Three month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.4726%.(b)Three month LIBOR plus 0.7980%.(c)Three month LIBOR plus 4.8275%.(d)Three month LIBOR plus 6.675%.(e)Three month LIBOR plus 3.945%.(f)Three month LIBOR plus 2.05%.(g)Three month LIBOR.(h)Six month LIBOR.(i)Exchange of payments does not begin until December 2016, December 2016, May 2017, December 2013, June 2018 and June 2013, respectively.(j)Three month Bankers Acceptance Rate.(k)One month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor).(l)Six month Euribor.(m)Rate varies over time from 0.4914% to 3.0048%.Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near term market change, the net fair value of NEEs net liabilities would increase by approximately $1,012 million ($421 million for FPL) at December 31, 2011.66Table of ContentsEquity Price RiskNEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities. For example, NEEs nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities primarily carried at their market value of approximately $1,970 million and $2,041 million ($1,238 million and $1,262 million for FPL) at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near term market change, would result in a $183 million ($116 million for FPL) reduction in fair value. For FPL, a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment, and for NEEs non rate regulated operations, a corresponding adjustment would be made to OCI to the extent the market value of the securities exceeded amortized cost and to OTTI loss to the extent the market value is below amortized cost.Currency Exchange Rate RiskAt December 31, 2011, with respect to certain debt issuances and borrowings, NEECH has two cross currency swaps to hedge against currency movements with respect to both interest and principal payments. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of cross currency swaps was approximately $18 million and $44 million, respectively.Credit RiskNEE and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NEE manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees.Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. NEEs credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions, NEEs energy marketing and trading operations, which includes FPLs energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEEs energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include the following:Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry.Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EMC.Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral.Master netting agreements are used to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. NEEs policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.Based on NEEs policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 97% of NEEs and 100% of FPLs energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.Item 7A.
