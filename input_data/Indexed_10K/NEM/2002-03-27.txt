ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes. Results for 2000 and 1999 have been restated to reflect the merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company in Janaury 2001 on a pooling of interests basis. Results do not reflect the February 2002 acquisitions described below. On February 13, 2002, Newmont stockholders approved adoption of an Agreement and Plan of Merger that provided for a restructuring of Newmont to facilitate the February 2002 acquisitions described below and to create a flexible corporate structure. Newmont merged with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary that resulted in Newmont becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of a new holding company. The new holding company, previously a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont, was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation. There is no impact to the consolidated financial statements of Newmont as a result of this restructuring and former stockholders of Newmont became stockholders of the new holding company. Summary Newmont recorded a net loss to common shares of $30.8 million ($0.16 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with net losses of $102 million ($0.53 per share) for both 2000 and 1999. Results for 2001 included, after tax, $43.7 million ($0.22 per share) for restructuring and Battle Mountain merger expenses, $26.7 million ($0.14 per share) for asset write downs, $24.8 million ($0.13 per share) for prior period income tax benefits, $3.3 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses and $1.1 million for a gain on written call options. 36 Results in 2000 included after tax noncash charges of $44.4 million ($0.23 per share) for asset write downs primarily on Battle Mountain properties, $27.4 million ($0.14 per share) for expenses associated with an acquisition settlement, $23.9 million ($0.12 per share) for losses on marketable securities, $12.6 million ($0.07 per share) for the cumulative effect of accounting changes for revenue recognition, $12.4 million ($0.06 per share) for amortization of put option premiums and $4.0 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses. Also included were after tax charges of $6.9 million ($0.04 per share) for merger expenses and a noncash unrealized mark to market gain on call option contracts of $17.4 million ($0.09 per share). For 1999, results included after tax noncash charges for impairment of an equity investment in Lihir Gold of $46.8 million ($0.24 per share, also net of minority interest), for asset write downs of $38.3 million ($0.20 per share), for an unrealized mark to market loss on call options of $29.1 million ($0.15 per share) and for amortization of put option premiums of $12.0 million ($0.06 per share), partially offset by gains from the sale of exploration properties of $13.6 million ($0.07 per share) and by foreign currency exchange gains of $5.3 million ($0.03 per share). As a largely unhedged company, Newmonts realized gold price of $271, $281, and $284 per equity ounce sold in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, closely tracked the declining spot market price. In this environment, Newmonts focus has been to maximize cash flow through cost efficiencies and disciplined capital spending. Newmonts Gold Medal Performance program, a company wide employee driven effort to systematically reduce costs and improve productivity and cash flow by implementing best practices, has driven this focus over the past two years and was extended to each Battle Mountain operation. In 2001, gold sales were 5.43 million equity ounces, compared to 5.73 million and 4.95 million equity ounces in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total cash costs of production were $184 per ounce in 2001, $170 per ounce in 2000 and $173 per ounce in 1999. As a result of lower production and average realized prices, cash flow from operations declined to $381 million in 2001 from $568 million in 2000. Long term debt, net of cash balances, remained at $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, compared with December 31, 2000. Gold reserves at December 31, 2001 totaled 59.6 million contained equity ounces compared with 66.3 million ounces at December 31, 2000. Reserve calculations for 2001 and 2000 were based on a long term price assumption of $300 per ounce. A long term gold price of $275 per ounce could lower reserves approximately 7%, while a $325 per ounce price could increase reserves approximately 5%. In 2001, copper sales totaled 360 million equity pounds for 2001, compared with 294 million equity pounds in 2000. Total cash costs were $0.36 and $0.57 per equity pound, after gold sales credits, for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average realized price in 2001 was $0.70 per pound, compared with $0.82 per pound in 2000. Proven and probable reserves totaled 6.0 billion contained equity pounds of copper at December 31, 2001. Mergers and Acquisitions Normandy Mining Limited and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited In November 2001, Newmont announced proposed acquisitions of Normandy Mining Limited, an Australian company, and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited, a Canadian company. On February 16, 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Franco Nevada pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement. On February 20, 2002, Newmont gained control of Normandy through an off market bid for all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Normandy. On February 26, 2002, when Newmonts off market bid for Normandy expired, Newmont had a relevant interest in more than 96% of Normandys outstanding shares. Newmont is exercising compulsory acquisition rights under Australian law to acquire all of the remaining shares of Normandy and expects this process to be completed by April 2002. The consideration for Normandy included 3.85 shares of Newmont common stock for every 100 shares of Normandy (including ordinary shares represented by American depositary receipts) plus A$0.50 per Normandy share, or the U.S. dollar equivalent of that amount for stockholders outside 37 Australia, net to the seller in cash. Pursuant to a Canadian Plan of Arrangement, Franco Nevada was acquired in a stock for stock transaction in which Franco Nevada common stockholders received 0.80 shares of Newmont common stock or 0.80 of an exchangeable share, exchangeable for Newmont common stock, for each common share of Franco Nevada held. Newmont will issue approximately 194 million shares (or share equivalents) in conjunction with these acquisitions, which, including the cash compensation paid, reflect a fair value of approximately $4.3 billion. Normandy is Australias largest gold producer, with over 2 million ounces of gold production annually, and with operations in Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Turkey, Chile, Brazil and Canada. Normandy is also a producer of zinc concentrates and owns interests in companies producing cobalt and magnesium. Franco Nevada has a portfolio of royalty interests covering producing and non producing mineral properties located in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia and various South American countries. Franco Nevada also has a portfolio of oil and gas interests in western Canada and various direct and indirect interests through investments in resource properties in Canada, Nevada, Central and South America, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia and the Dominican Republic. The acquisitions are being accounted for using the purchase method whereby assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair market value as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over such fair value will be recorded as goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill will be assigned to assets acquired and will not be amortized. Goodwill is subject to a determination of fair value at least annually and at such times as events or circumstances indicate impairment has occurred. Newmont expects to incur at least an estimated $90 million of incremental direct costs associated with the acquisitions, which will be capitalized. As of December 31, 2001, Newmont had spent approximately $4.1 million of such acquisition costs. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisitions, it is expected that approximately $70 million of after tax synergies will be realized in the first full year of operations, increasing to approximately $90 million by the end of the second full year. Such synergies will be obtained from the rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration and development budgets as well as operating efficiencies and costs reductions associated with procurement, interest and tax benefits. Battle Mountain Gold Company On January 10, 2001, Newmont completed a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated June 21, 2000, under which each share of common stock of Battle Mountain and each exchangeable share of Battle Mountain Canada Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Battle Mountain) was converted into the right to receive 0.105 share of Newmont, or approximately 24.1 million shares. Newmont also exchanged 2.3 million shares of newly issued $3.25 convertible preferred stock for all outstanding shares of Battle Mountain $3.25 convertible preferred stock. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and as such, consolidated financial statements include Battle Mountains financial data as if Battle Mountain had always been part of Newmont. During 2001, Newmont successfully integrated the former Battle Mountain operations in Canada and Bolivia, the Phoenix development project in Nevada, and its interest in the Pajingo joint venture operation in Australia. Synergies in excess of the estimated $25 million, pre tax, were achieved during 2001 from consolidation of administrative and exploration staffs, purchasing economies and application of Gold Medal Performance. The Phoenix project will provide an opportunity for additional synergies in future years from utilization of existing nearby processing facilities. Market Conditions and Risks Metal Price Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, 38 purchases and lending; investor sentiment and production levels. Based on estimates of Newmont stand alone 2002 production and expenses, a $10 per ounce change in the gold price would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $71 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $42 million (about $0.21 per share) in net income. Changes in the market price of copper also affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow from its equity investment in Batu Hijau. Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. Based on estimates of Newmont stand alone 2002 production and expenses, a $0.10 per pound change in the copper price would result in an increase or decrease in net income of approximately $13 million (about $0.07 per share). Newmont has generally sold its gold production at market prices; however, it had forward sales contracts (1) from its Golden Giant operations for 31,000 ounces in 2001 at an average price of $314 per ounce and 34,000 ounces in 2000 at an average price of $316 per ounce, and (2) for 125,000 ounces in each of 2000 and 1999 from its Minahasa mine in Indonesia at an average price of $454 per ounce. In December 2001, Newmont entered into offsetting positions to effectively close out the combination matched put and call options and the flat forward sales contracts at its Golden Giant operations. Following a decline in spot market prices to $253 per ounce in July 1999, Newmont entered into two put and call option contracts to provide a measure of price protection, as described in Note 9. The call options, covering 2.35 million ounces, were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under the terms of the contracts, Newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $350 per ounce in 2005 to $392 per ounce in 2011. The value of the sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. Newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to its commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. Credit risk is minimized by contracting only with major financial institutions/counterparties. At December 31, 2001, the following offsetting commodity instruments were outstanding: Fair Ounces Value (in millions) Combination, matched put and call options, expiring 2002 2004... 193,067 $3.2 Offsetting combination, matched put and call options, expiring 2002 2004...................................................... 193,067 (3.2) Flat forward sales contracts, 2002 2004......................... 64,067 2.0 Forward purchase contracts, 2002 2004........................... 64,067 (2.0) At December 31, 2001 the Normandy hedge position consisted of derivative contracts covering approximately 8.6 million ounces of gold at an average price of $283 per ounce. At that time, the Normandy hedge position included forward sales, purchased put and convertible put contracts covering 5.8, 1.3 and 1.5 million ounces at net contract prices of $286, $267 and $283, respectively. At December 31, 2001, the mark to market value of the combined Normandy hedge position (which includes subsidiaries) represented an approximate liability of $239 million. All prices and values noted above were converted to US dollars at the December 31, 2001, closing exchange rate of A$1.9543/US$. Foreign Currency In addition to the U.S., Newmont operates in Canada, Peru, Bolivia, Uzbekistan and Indonesia and has interests in joint ventures in Australia and Mexico. Gold produced at these operations is sold in the international markets for U.S. dollars. The cost and debt structures at these operations are primarily U.S. dollar denominated, except for the Canadian and Australian operations where such structures are primarily denominated in local 39 currencies. To the extent there are fluctuations in local currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, the devaluation of a local currency is generally economically neutral or beneficial to the operation because local salaries and supply contracts will decrease against the U.S. dollar revenue stream. Foreign currency exchange rate losses primarily related to Canadian and Australian operations were $5.1 million and $6.2 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and gains were $8.2 million in 1999. Interest Rates At December 31, 2001, Newmonts long term debt of $1,281.9 million included $334.6 million of variable rate debt (which included $200 million of principal tied to fixed for floating interest rate swaps) with an average interest rate of 6.7%, and fixed rate debt of $947.3 million, with an average interest rate of 7.6% and an estimated fair value of $954.3 million. Newmonts public debt has investment grade credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service (Baa3) and Standard & Poors Ratings Services (BBB). During the last half of 2001, Newmont entered into contracts to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its $275 million 8 5/8% notes and its $200 million 8 3/8% debentures. Newmont receives fixed rate interest payments at 8 5/8% or 8 3/8% and pays floating rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 4.25%. The notional principal amount of these transactions (representing the amount of principal tied to floating interest rate exposure) was $200 million at December 31, 2001. Half of these contracts expire in July 2005 and half expire in May 2011. At December 31, 2001, these transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $0.8 million. These transactions have been designated as fair value hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $0.6 million. Fuel Hedges Newmont uses certain derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its exposure to fuel price market fluctuations, from time to time. At December 31, 2001, Newmont had contracts expiring September 2002 covering approximately 8.6 million gallons of diesel fuel at its Nevada operations at prices ranging from approximately $0.61 to $0.69 per gallon. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $1.3 million. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of Newmonts financial statements in conformity with accounting principles accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most critical accounting principles upon which Newmonts financial status depends are those requiring estimates of proven and probable reserves, recoverable ounces therefrom, and or assumptions of future gold prices. Such estimates and assumptions affect the value of inventories (which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value), the potential impairment of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. These estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which depreciation and amortization are charged to earnings. As noted above, commodity prices significantly affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow. In addition, management estimates costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as remediation costs for inactive properties as described below. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions. 40 Results of Operations Total Cash Cost Per Equity Ozs.

(35.9) (35.9) Total/Weighted average............... 5,430.2 5,727.8 4,946.2 $184 $170 $173 Total cash costs include charges for mining ore and waste associated with current period gold production, processing ore through milling and leaching facilities, production taxes, royalties and other cash costs. Total cash costs per ounce for Golden Giant, Holloway, Yanacocha, Kori Kollo and Vera/Nancy in 2000 and Golden Giant and Holloway in 1999 have been restated to reflect consistent categorization of expense types included in cash costs for all mines. North American Operations Newmonts Nevada operations (along the Carlin Trend near Elko and in the Winnemucca region, where Twin Creeks and the Lone Tree Complex are located) include production from nine open pit and four underground mines. Oxide ores are processed by milling or heap leaching, depending upon ore grade. The Carlin roaster and Winnemucca region autoclaves process higher grade refractory ores. The Lone Tree flotation plant processes lower grade refractory ores. A developed linear program is utilized to determine the best mix of ores for each processing plant to maximize recoveries and economic returns. Nevadas sales of 2.7 million ounces in 2001 were 11% lower than in 2000, with the depletion of the Deep Post surface deposit early in 2001 resulting in approximately 300,000 less high grade, low cost open pit ounces produced during 2001 than during 2000. This also caused total cash costs to increase to $222 per ounce in 2001. Approximately 139 million tons of material were mined from surface open pits in 2001, down 31% and 37% from 2000 and 1999, respectively. Refractory ore treatment facilities, with higher processing costs than oxide ore mills, generated 65% of Nevadas production in 2001, as compared to 68% and 54% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Production and total cash costs in 2002 are expected to remain consistent with 2001 levels. Production from the Deep Post underground mine commenced in the first quarter of 2001 and approximately $10 million has been allocated for capital equipment and mine development during 2002. By 2003, Deep Post is expected to reach an annual production rate of approximately 380,000 ounces at an estimated average total cash cost of approximately $150 per ounce over the life of the mine. While permitting and metallurgical work will continue on the Phoenix project, minimal capital will be allocated for mine construction during 2002 under the current market gold price environment. Gold sales at the Mesquite heap leach mine in southern California decreased 29% to 92,600 ounces in 2001. Total cash costs per ounce also decreased 7% to $205 per ounce. Mining activities ceased in the second quarter 41 of 2001 with the depletion of the ore body. Final gold production from continued declining recovery of gold from heap leach pads is expected in 2003. Selected equipment from the Mesquite mine has been transferred to operations in South America and in Nevada. At La Herradura, a 44% owned, nonoperated heap leach operation in Sonora, Mexico, Newmonts equity share of 2001 sales totaled 54,700 ounces at a total cash cost of $173 per ounce. Production in 2002 is expected at approximately 65,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $178 per ounce. Production sold from the Golden Giant underground mine in Ontario, Canada was 284,000 ounces at a total cash cost of $187 per ounce compared with 407,000 ounces at $146 per ounce and 356,000 ounces at $144 per ounce in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The maturing mine has experienced lower average ore grades over the past three years and in 2002, production is expected to be approximately 280,000 ounces at $166 per ounce. The Holloway underground mine in Ontario, Canada is an 84.65% owned joint venture with Teddy Bear Valley Mines. In 2001, sales totaled 89,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $209 per ounce and in 2002 are expected to increase to approximately 100,000 equity ounces at $196 per ounce. Overseas Operations Minera Yanacocha in Peru is 51.35% owned and includes five open pit mines, four leach pads, two gold recovery plants and a crushing agglomeration facility. In 2001, Yanacocha achieved record sales of 1.91 million ounces (983,000 equity ounces), a 9% increase from 2000 and 16% more than in 1999. Total cash costs of $115 per ounce are comparatively low because of low waste to ore ratios and porous ore that yields high gold recoveries without crushing prior to heap leaching for most ore types. Production at Yanacocha has grown annually through the discovery and development of reserves and increased mining and processing capacity. During 2001, approximately 156 million tons of material were mined (85 million ore tons and 71 million waste tons), an 18% increase from 2000 and 47% more than in 1999. In late 1999, Yanacocha terminated its contract mining agreement and improved productivity and efficiency by conducting mine operations with its own employees. Yanacochas first crushing and agglomeration facility, for the La Quinua deposit, started up late in the third quarter of 2001 and will continue to undergo commissioning adjustments through the first half of 2002, gradually stepping up to its design rate of 132,000 tons per day (120,000 metric tons per day) by the end of June. Production in 2001 was slightly lower than targeted due to slower leach cycle recoveries for gold and short term bottlenecks in mining fleet utilization and availability during the commissioning of the new crushing facility. In 2002, production is expected to exceed 2.3 million ounces (1.2 million equity ounces) with a full year of production from the La Quinua mine. Total cash costs at Yanacocha are expected to increase to approximately $125 per ounce as the processing of La Quinua ore, which requires crushing and agglomeration before heap leaching, will impact overall costs. By 2003, production from La Quinua is expected to reach over one million ounces annually at a total cash cost of approximately $129 per ounce over the life of the deposit. The Kori Kollo open pit mine in Bolivia is held by Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., in which Newmont has an 88% interest and Zeland Mines, S.A. has a 12% interest. Production sold in 2001 was 275,000 equity ounces, up from 248,000 and 256,000 equity ounces in 2000 and 1999, respectively, reflecting ore placements on the new heap leach pad that commenced operation in the third quarter of 2001. Total cash costs decreased to $158 per ounce, a result of increased production. For 2002, production is expected at approximately 264,000 equity ounces with cash costs of $146 per ounce. The Zarafshan Newmont Joint Venture, in the Central Asian Republic of Uzbekistan, is a 50/50 joint venture between Newmont and two Uzbekistan government entities. Zarafshan Newmont produces gold by crushing and heap leaching low grade oxide ore from existing stockpiles at the government owned Muruntau mine. Gold sales in 2001 totaled 444,000 ounces (222,000 equity ounces) compared with 502,800 ounces (251,400 equity ounces) in 2000 and 542,900 ounces (271,500 equity ounces) in 1999. Total cash costs increased to $136 per ounce from 42 $129 per ounce in 2000 and decreased from $161 per ounce in 1999. The leach pad expansion construction is underway following the signing of an amended ore supply agreement under which the joint venture will purchase 150 million metric tons of ore from the Uzbek government at an average grade of 1.44 grams per metric ton. This agreement extends the operations life to at least 2012. The leach pad expansion project is scheduled for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Production in 2002 is expected to be consistent with 2001 at approximately 450,000 ounces (225,000 equity ounces), with total cash costs increasing to approximately $169 per ounce primarily from lower foreign exchange gains and higher utility and supply costs associated with the operation of the expanded leach pad. At Minahasa, in Indonesia, Newmont has an 80% interest but receives a greater percent of the gold production until recouping the bulk of its investment including interest. Prior to November 2001, Newmont received 100% of Minahasas gold production and subsequently received 94%, as Newmont recouped some of its investment through the collection of funds in accordance with existing loan agreements. Production decreased to 341,500 equity ounces with total cash costs of $142 per ounce, 7% higher than 2000, primarily from lower grade ore. Mining activities ceased late in 2001; however, it is expected that processing will continue until 2003. Production in 2002 is expected at approximately 120,000 equity ounces, with total cash costs of approximately $236 per ounce. At Pajingo (Vera/Nancy), a 50% owned joint venture with Normandy, the operator of the underground mine in Queensland, Australia, Newmonts equity share of 2001 sales totaled 126,000 ounces at a total cash cost of $105 per ounce. Increased sales from 2000 and 1999 resulted from production increases from the completion of a mill expansion project in 1999. Total production in 2002 is expected at approximately 290,000 ounces with cash costs of $82 per ounce. The Batu Hijau copper/gold mine in Indonesia completed its first full year of production in 2000 following start up in the fourth quarter of 1999. Newmont holds an indirect 45% equity interest in the mine, but receives 56.25% of production until recouping the bulk of its investment. Concentrate sales in 2001 included 360.0 million equity pounds of copper and 295,100 equity ounces of gold. In 2000, sales totaled 294.2 million equity pounds of copper and 178,400 equity ounces of gold. Total cash costs, after gold sales credits, of $0.36 per pound in 2001 compared to $0.57 per pound in 2000. Production in 2002 is expected at between 550 million to 600 million pounds of copper (310 million to 340 million equity pounds) and between 360,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold (200,000 to 225,000 equity ounces). Total cash costs are expected to be approximately $0.43 per pound, after gold sales credits. Financial Results Consolidated sales include 100% of Yanacocha and Kori Kollo production and Newmonts ownership share of production elsewhere, except for Batu Hijau, which is accounted for as an equity investment. Variances in sales revenue are illustrated in the following table: Years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Consolidated sales (in millions).................... $1,656.1 $1,809.5 $1,627.1 Consolidated production ozs. sold (in thousands).... 6,104.0 6,437.0 5,780.3 Average price received per ounce.................... $ 271 $ 281 $ 284 Average market price received per ounce............. $ 271 $ 279 $ 280 2001 2000 vs vs 2000 1999 Increase (decrease) in consolidated sales due to (in millions): Consolidated production..................................... $ (91.2) $191.2 Average gold price received.................................

Also included were foreign currency exchange losses of $5.1 million and $6.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and foreign currency exchange gains of $8.2 million in 1999. Sales of exploration properties generated gains of $3.7 million, $1.6 million and $20.6. million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Costs applicable to sales include total cash costs and provisions for estimated final reclamation expenses related to consolidated production. The increase in costs primarily related to higher operating costs at Yanacocha from higher tonnage moved and greater processing and administration costs, partially offset by cost reduction efforts at all locations.

(0.1) (1.6) (2.1) Total............................................ $1,093.0 $1,065.5 $981.3 Certain mining costs associated with deposits that have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios over the mine life are capitalized. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, such costs were capitalized for certain deposits at the Nevada operations ($10.8 million in 2001, $25.0 million in 2000 and $26.0 million in 1999). These costs are charged to operating expenses as the related gold is sold. Reduced mining rates led to lower capitalized mining costs in 2001 and 2000. 44 Depreciation and depletion decreased in 2001 primarily as a result of decreased gold production at Nevada, partially offset by the impact of 2000 capital expenditures at Yanacocha. The increase in 2000 primarily resulted from increased gold production in Nevada and Yanacocha.

The decrease in 2001 reflected planned reductions as a result of lower gold prices than in previous years and the increased focus on exploration activities at or around existing operations. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $86.4 million, $94.6 million and $77.7 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net interest expense in 2001 decreased because of lower average interest rates and higher capitalized interest for Yanacocha. Expenses for acquisition settlement of $42.2 million in 2000 related to the resolution of a dispute regarding Newmonts purchase of an additional 13.35% interest in Minera Yanacocha as described in Note 15. Write down of assets in 2001 of $41.0 million pre tax consisted of a reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets, and inventory reductions and were primarily related to Minahasa ($18.9 million), Nevada ($11.7 million), Kori Kollo ($4.8 million) and the San Luis property in Colorado ($3.5 million). As described in Note 16, the write down of long lived assets represents the excess carrying value of assets compared to fair value, with fair value determined using discounted future cash flow analyses. Such cash flows are based on estimated recoverable ounces, future production and capital costs, and gold price assumptions. Gold price assumptions were $285 per ounce in 2002 and $300 per ounce thereafter. The Minahasa write down reduced fixed assets by $12.1 million, increased reclamation liabilities by $3.7 million, and reduced ore stockpile and materials and supply inventories by $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Nevada write down reduced ore and in process inventory by $7.3 million and fixed assets by $4.4 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced fixed assets by $4.8 million. The San Luis write down reduced fixed assets by $2.0 million and materials and supply inventory by $1.5 million. The write downs had no impact on the scope of these operations and will reduce future pre tax Costs applicable to sales by $16.9 million and Depreciation and depletion by $24.1 million based on remaining production as of December 31, 2001, with no impact on future cash flows. In 2000, the write down of assets was $58.4 million pre tax and related to Holloway ($30.8 million), Mesquite ($14.8 million), Kori Kollo ($5.6 million), the Mezcala property in Mexico ($6.5 million) and to inventory at the Battle Mountain Complex ($0.7 million). For 2000, gold price assumptions were $285 per ounce in 2001 and $300 per ounce thereafter. The Holloway write down reduced fixed assets by $30.8 million. The 45 Mesquite write down reduced leach pad inventory by $9.7 million, capitalized mining by $1.4 million and fixed assets by $3.7 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced inventory by $4.9 million and fixed assets by $0.7 million. The write downs reduced future pre tax Costs applicable to sales by $16.0 million and Depreciation and depletion by $35.2 million. The acquisition cost of the Mezcala property was written off as no future cash flows from the property were anticipated as of December 31, 2000. In 1999, Battle Mountains Crown Jewel project in Washington was written off ($35.9 million) and Nevada stockpile inventories were written down ($3.5 million). The Crown Jewel write down related to mine development costs and the remaining carrying value as a result of permitting uncertainties arising from a January 2000 decision from the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board that reversed its water rights permits and vacated its Clean Water Act certification. In 2001, Newmont disposed of its interest in the Crown Jewel property, but retained a royalty on future production. Merger and restructuring expenses of $60.5 million in 2001 included $28.1 million of transaction and related costs associated with the Battle Mountain merger and $32.4 million of restructuring expenses that included $22.1 million for voluntary early retirement pension benefits and $10.3 million for employee severance and office closures. Other expenses in 2001, 2000 and 1999 included $1.0 million, $12.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively, for environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. The year 2000 also included $13.2 million to increase the remediation liability for San Luis, Colorado and $10.0 million for costs associated with a mercury spill at Yanacocha, both described below. In 1999, $9.5 million was included for San Luis and $5.4 million for costs associated with terminating the contract mining agreement at Yanacocha. Gain (loss) on written call options reflected the change in fair value of the contracts at the end of each year. In September 2001, Newmont entered into transactions that closed out the call options. These options were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. The call options were marked to the market value of $53.8 million immediately prior to close, resulting in a noncash gain of $1.8 million in 2001. The value of the new sales contracts was recorded as Deferred revenue from sale of future production and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. In 2000, the noncash gain on the written call options was $26.8 million and in 1999 there was a noncash loss of $44.8 million. Loss on marketable securities of Lihir reflected a noncash write down of $23.9 million as of December 31, 2000, resulting from an other than temporary decline in market value based on the length of time and the extent to which such value had been less than cost basis. During 2001, the valuation of the marketable securities of Lihir significantly increased, resulting in an $18.3 million gain charged to Other comprehensive income (loss). As described in Note 1, Lihir Gold operates a gold mine in Papua New Guinea and prior to 2000 the investment was accounted for on an equity basis. Income tax benefit of $52.8 million in 2001 included benefits of tax depletion, utilization of tax loss carry forwards, utilization of foreign tax credits and resolution of tax issues provided for prior to 2001. In 2000, income tax expense was $1.2 million, with an effective tax rate of 6%, including benefits from tax depletion and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities associated with undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. In 1999, income tax expense was $21.8 million with an effective rate of 37%. Equity income (loss) and impairment of affiliates included income of $33.0 million from Batu Hijau in 2001, and losses of $9.9 million and $10.7 in 2000 and 1999, respectively, reflecting the ramp up in production that commenced in the fourth quarter of 1999. Also included in 1999 were impairments for the equity investment in Lihir Gold of $76.2 million. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in 2001 included an $18.3 million gain for temporary changes in the market value of Lihir Gold securities, $3.2 million for losses associated with foreign currency 46 translation adjustments and $1.6 million for the effective portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedge instruments. For 2000, other comprehensive loss, net of tax, included a loss of $1.8 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and a $1.3 million minimum pension liability adjustment. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") Nos. 141 and 142, "Business Combinations" and "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," respectively. The adoption of these standards on January 1, 2002 did not impact Newmonts historical financial statements or results of operations. As previously noted, the 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada are being accounted for as purchases and a significant portion of the $4.3 billion purchase price will represent goodwill, resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Such goodwill will not be amortized, but will be subject to impairment testing at least annually, as prescribed by SFAS No. 144. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," that established uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement will be adopted January 1, 2003, when Newmont will record the estimated present value of reclamation liabilities and increase the carrying amount of the related asset. Subsequently, reclamation costs will be allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. Newmont is in the process of quantifying the effect of adoption on January 1, 2003. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121 ("Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"), for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and there was no impact upon adoption. Effective January 1, 2000, Newmont changed its method of accounting, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, to recognize revenue when third party refined gold is delivered to the customer rather than upon the completion of the production process, or when gold was poured into dore at the mine. As discussed in Note 18, the cumulative effect of the accounting change was a $12.6 million charge to net income, net of tax and minority interest, and included $3.9 million for the Canadian operations, $3.2 million for Minahasa, $2.2 million for Yanacocha, $1.6 million for Zarafshan Newmont, $1.4 million for Nevada, $0.2 million for Kori Kollo and $0.1 million for Pajingo (Vera/Nancy). Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," to recognize derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value. As a result, the Company increased Other comprehensive income by $1.7 million, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of the accounting change. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year 2001, cash flow from operating activities of $381.3 million, restricted cash of $40.0 million and net debt borrowings of $70.0 million funded capital expenditures of $401.6 million and dividends of $31.0 million. On a stand alone basis, Newmont expects to generate approximately 35% to 40% more cash from operations in 2002 at current gold prices. Following the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions, Newmont expects to have increased financial liquidity at current gold prices with an estimated net debt to total capitalization ratio of 24% and sufficient cash flows to fund capital expenditures, dividends and debt reduction. Investing Activities Batu Hijau As discussed above and in Note 5, Newmont has an indirect 45% interest in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and its partner, an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation, has an indirect 35% interest. Because Newmont 47 and Sumitomo carried the interest of the 20% Indonesian partner, Newmont recognizes 56.25% of Batu Hijaus income until recouping the bulk of its investment. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Newmonts investment in Batu Hijau was $559.8 million and $527.6 million, respectively. Newmont and Sumitomo have a contingent obligation to provide a $125 million support facility on a pro rata basis, if required. During 2001, Newmont advanced approximately $9.0 million to Batu Hijau under the contingent support facility and received $8.4 million in principal repayments associated with an existing shareholder loan. Newmont and Sumitomo will be required to provide additional funds under the contingent support facility during 2002. The amount of this contingent support will depend upon copper and gold prices, necessary capital expenditures at Batu Hijau, and required principal and interest payments. The US$1.0 billion project financing facility entered into in July 1997 ("Senior Debt") was fully utilized as of December 31, 2000, and the balance outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $913 million. This loan became non recourse to Newmont when project completion tests were met in October 2000. Semi annual debt repayments of $43.5 million commenced in May 2001. Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC) Normandy has a 22.8% voting interest in AMC, which has recently raised A$525 million of equity to support the development of a A$1.3 billion project involving a proprietary chemical and dehydration process for producing anhydrous magnesium chloride as feed for an electrolytic cell to produce molten magnesium metal. Normandy has an obligation to contribute to AMC A$100 million in equity between October 31, 2002 and January 31, 2003. Additionally, Normandy is guarantor of AMCs foreign exchange hedging position of approximately A$204 million, with a fair value of negative US$10.4 million at December 31, 2001, as well as AMCs A$72 million corporate facility. Normandy also has provided a A$90 million contingency equity commitment in the event that the project does not achieve certain specified production and operating criteria by September 2006. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures decreased in 2001 from 2000 primarily from the completion of the development of the Deep Post underground mine in early 2001 and reduced stripping activity in Nevada. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Capital expenditures: North American operations: Nevada operations........................................ $ 58.5 $ 90.6 $ 65.0 Mesquite................................................. 0.4 4.2 1.2 La Herradura............................................. 1.8 6.5 5.2 Golden Giant............................................. 7.1 14.9 9.7 Holloway................................................. 1.5 5.5 3.9 South American operations: Yanacocha (100%)......................................... 276.9 276.9 126.3 Kori Kollo............................................... 10.5 7.8 7.0 Zarafshan Newmont......................................... 20.4 4.3 3.2 Minahasa.................................................. 2.2 10.8 Vera/Nancy................................................ 7.3 4.9 10.2 Other projects and capitalized interest................... 17.2 3.1 27.7 Total................................................... $401.6 $420.9 $270.2 In 2001, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($15.7 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), mine facilities at Deep Post ($9.9 million), capitalized mining costs ($10.8 million), mining equipment ($6.3 million), development of the Phoenix project ($4.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($128.4 million), Yanacocha 48 leach pad operations ($44.9 million), mining equipment ($44.3 million), Carachugo leach pad operations ($19.3 million) and other replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Zarafshan Newmont included $19 million for heap leach pad expansion and associated conveyor support facility. In 2000, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($27.5 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), capitalized mining costs ($25.0 million), development of the Phoenix project ($9.8 million), mining equipment ($10.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($144.2 million), unitization of regional properties ($45.7 million), leach pad expansion ($30.8 million), mine development ($30.0 million) and other replacement capital. During 1999, capital expenditures in Nevada included capitalized mining costs ($26.0 million), deferred mine development ($15.1 million), development of the Phoenix project ($12.8 million), refractory leach pads ($5.8 million) and other ongoing capital requirements. Yanacocha capital expenditures included costs to convert to owner mining ($58.3 million), leach pad expansion ($41.2 million) and development drilling and mine development ($18.0 million). Capital requirements for 2002 will be determined following completion of the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada. Newmont expects to spend approximately $210 million at Yanacocha (primarily for leach pad construction at the La Quinua and Carachugo sites, surface mine development, and a site water management plan), $95 million in Nevada (primarily for development of the Leeville underground mine, further development of the Deep Post underground mine, the Gold Quarry expansion and capitalized mining) and $10 million at Zarafshan Newmont (primarily for leach pad expansion and waste stripping). Other In 2000, Battle Mountain received shares of Lihir Gold as a result of its merger with Niugini Mining as described in Note 1, a portion of which were in exchange for Niuginis $54.7 million in cash. In 1999, Newmonts affiliates received $14.1 million from the sale of two exploration properties and $11.9 million from the sale of an investment in First Toronto Investments Limited, and paid an $11.0 million liquidating dividend related to the sale of the New World project in Montana. Financing Activities Newmonts $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into June 1997, was replaced in October 2001 with two unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 million facility with an initial term of 364 days, which may be extended annually to October 2006; and a $400 million revolving facility which matures in October 2006. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on Newmonts credit rating. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 0.77% to 1.25% or the greater of the federal funds rate or the lead banks prime rate. Annual fees vary from 0.10% to 0.30%. At December 31, 2001, the fees were 0.15% and 0.175% of the commitment for the $200 million and the $400 million facility, respectively. The facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified limitations on debt to capitalization, debt to "earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization," incurring liens and transactions with affiliates. There were no borrowings under the new facilities at December 31, 2001. Newmont is in compliance with all financial debt covenants. In May 2001, Newmont issued $275 million of public unsecured notes due May 2011 bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625%. Proceeds of $272 million, after transaction costs, were used to repay debt outstanding under Newmonts revolving credit facility, with the remainder for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in May and November and the notes are redeemable prior to maturity under certain conditions. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. In December 2000, Zarafshan Newmont obtained a $30 million additional facility, expiring in 2007, with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be used to expand leach pad capacity. The interest 49 rate on this facility is based on the three month LIBOR plus 3.25%. At December 31, 2001, $30 million ($15 million Newmonts share) was outstanding and no borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2000. Newmont guarantees 50% of borrowings under this facility. Battle Mountain Canada had $87.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2000 under a loan agreement with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. In January 2001, subsequent to the merger with Battle Mountain, Newmont repaid this loan with $40 million of restricted cash and with borrowings from its revolving credit facility. Scheduled minimum long term debt repayments associated with stand alone Newmont financing facilities at December 31, 2001 are $192.2 million in 2002. Newmont expects to fund maturities of its debt from operating cash flow, by refinancing the debt as it becomes due, and subsequent to the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada, from combined cash balances. On March 18, 2002, Newmont, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, made an offer to repurchase any and all of the outstanding 8 7/8% Senior Notes due 2008 of Normandy Yandal Operations Limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont. As of the offer date, $300 million principal amount of notes was outstanding. The repurchase offer was made pursuant to the terms of an Indenture dated as of April 7, 1998, between Normandy Yandal and the Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Indenture requires that Normandy Yandal, following a "Change of Control" as defined in the Indenture, make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. Although the applicable provisions of the Indenture can be read to the contrary, Newmont is taking the position that a Change of Control occurred on February 20, 2002 when Newmont acquired control of Normandy Mining Limited of which Normandy Yandal is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. The Indenture provides that Normandy Yandal is not required to make the Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the offer. Newmonts offer, however, should not be construed as a commitment by Newmont to provide ongoing financial or credit support to Normandy Yandal. The Change of Contol Offer is open until May 14, 2002, unless extended. At this time, Newmont cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the Change of Control Offer or the amount Newmont will be required to pay under the Change of Control Offer. In conjunction with the Battle Mountain merger in January 2001, Newmont issued 24.1 million shares of Newmont common stock and 2.3 million shares of $3.25 convertible preferred Newmont stock. The preferred stock is convertible into shares of Newmont common stock at any time at a conversion ratio of 0.5 share of Newmont common stock. Holders of Newmont convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by Newmonts board of directors, an annual cash dividend of $3.25 per share, or $7.5 million for all shares, payable in equal quarterly installments. In conjunction with the acquisitions of Franco Nevada and Normandy, Newmont will issue approximately 194 million shares (including share equivalents). The A$0.50 per share cash portion of the Normandy purchase price will total approximately $465 million. Following the acquisitions, combined debt, net of cash balances, is expected to total approximately $2.2 billion. Developments in Indonesia Newmont operates the Minahasa mine on the island of Sulawesi and the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa. Both are in remote locations and have been largely unaffected by civil unrest coinciding with the recent period of political and social change in Indonesia. Both mines operate under Contracts of Work issued by the central government. Indonesias government has publicly expressed its intention to uphold existing Contracts of Work. Newmont continues to work with the local government and community leaders during this period of change. Environmental Included in 2001 capital expenditures was approximately $12.1 million to comply with environmental regulations. Expenditures of $27.8 million are anticipated in 2002 on a Newmont stand alone basis. Ongoing 50 costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of cash operating costs. Estimated future reclamation costs relating to currently producing mines are accrued over each mine life and at December 31, 2001, $128.4 million had been accrued. Newmont spent $8.1 million, $18.7 million and $20.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former mining sites discussed in Note 21, and expects to spend approximately $8.5 million in 2002 on a Newmont stand alone basis. In 2000 and 1999, the remediation liability associated with the San Luis property in Colorado was increased $13.2 million and $9.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2001, $57.3 million was accrued for total estimated future costs associated with all such obligations. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability may be as much as 50% greater or 30% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2001. Environmental obligations are continuously monitored and reviewed and, although Newmont believes that its reserves are adequate, as additional facts become known, further provisions may be required. In June 2000, a transport contractor of Minera Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles southwest of the mine. Mercury is a byproduct of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instrumentation and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Minera Yanacocha. In August 2000, Minera Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 soles (approximately US$500,000) to the Peruvian government. Minera Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. In addition, it has entered into agreements with three of the communities impacted by this incident to provide a variety of public works as compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident. On September 10, 2001, Minera Yanacocha, various wholly owned subsidiaries of Newmont, and other defendants were named in a lawsuit filed by over 900 Peruvian citizens in Denver District Court for the State of Colorado. This action seeks compensatory and punitive damages based on claims associated with the mercury spill incident. Estimated costs of $10 million for public works, remediation efforts, personal compensation and the fine were included in Other expense in 2000. Neither the Company nor Minera Yanacocha can reasonably predict the likelihood of any additional expenditures related to this matter.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newmont Mining Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As explained in Notes 2, 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition effective January 1, 2000 and its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on January 1, 2001. /s/ Arthur Andersen LLP ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Denver, Colorado, February 5, 2002. 52 NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands, except per share) Sales and other income Sales..................................... $1,656,116 $1,809,450 $1,627,083 Dividends, interest and other income...... 7,985 10,281 47,985 1,664,101 1,819,731 1,675,068 Costs and expenses Costs applicable to sales................. 1,092,959 1,065,514 981,279 Depreciation and depletion................ 300,096 359,453 303,777 Exploration and research.................. 55,528 77,377 74,213 General and administrative................ 61,153 63,657 68,330 Interest, net of amounts capitalized...... 86,415 94,567 77,654 Expenses for acquisition settlement....... 42,181 Write down of assets...................... 40,999 58,415 39,484 Merger and restructuring.................. 60,510 6,897 Other..................................... 11,466 34,606 25,980 1,709,126 1,802,667 1,570,717 Operating income (loss)....................

The Company also has an interest in a copper/gold mine that commenced production in late 1999. These consolidated financial statements give effect to the NMC/Battle Mountain merger in January 2001. Results do not reflect the February 2002 acquisitions described below. On February 13, 2002, NMC stockholders approved adoption of an Agreement and Plan of Merger that provides for a restructuring of the Company to facilitate the February 2002 acquisitions described below and to create a flexible corporate structure. NMC merged with an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary that resulted in NMC becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed holding company. The new holding company, previously a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NMC, was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation. There is no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements of NMC as a result of this restructuring and former stockholders of NMC became stockholders of the new holding company. Normandy Mining Limited and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited Acquisitions In November 2001, the Company announced proposed acquisitions of Normandy Mining Limited ("Normandy"), an Australian company, and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited ("Franco Nevada"), a Canadian company. On February 16, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of Franco Nevada pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement. On February 20, 2002, Newmont gained control of Normandy through an off market bid for all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Normandy. On February 26, when the Companys off market bid for Normandy expired, the company had a relevant interest in more than 96% of Normandys outstanding shares. The Company is exercising compulsory acquisition rights under Australian law to acquire all of the remaining shares of Normandy and expects this process to be completed in April 2002. The consideration for Normandy included 3.85 shares of NMC common stock for every 100 ordinary shares of Normandy (including ordinary shares represented by American depositary receipts) plus A$0.50 per Normandy share, or the U.S. dollar equivalent of that amount for Normandy stockholders outside Australia, net to the seller in cash. Pursuant to a Canadian Plan of Arrangement, the Company acquired Franco Nevada in a stock for stock transaction in which Franco Nevada common stockholders received 0.80 shares of NMC common stock or 0.80 of a Canadian exchangeable share, exchangeable for Newmont common, for each common share of Franco Nevada held. The exchangeable shares are substantially equivalent to NMC common shares. The Company will issue approximately 194 million NMC shares (or equivalents) and pay approximately $465 million in cash in conjunction with these acquisitions, reflecting a fair value of approximately $4.3 billion. The acquisitions are being accounted for using the purchase method whereby assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair market value as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over such fair value will be recorded as goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill will be assigned to assets acquired and will not be amortized. Goodwill is subject to a determination of fair value at least annually and at such times as events or circumstances indicate that an impairment has occurred. The Company expects to incur at least an estimated $90 million (unaudited) of direct costs associated with the acquisitions, which that will be capitalized. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had spent approximately $4.1 million of such acquisition costs. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisitions, it is expected that approximately $70 million (unaudited) of after tax synergies will be realized in the first full year of operations, increasing to approximately $90 million (unaudited) by the end of the second full year. Such synergies will be obtained from the rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration and development budgets, as well as operating efficiencies and costs reductions associated with procurement, interest and tax benefits. 57 Battle Mountain Merger On January 10, 2001, the Company completed a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company ("Battle Mountain") pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of June 21, 2000, under which each share of common stock of Battle Mountain and each exchangeable share of Battle Mountain Canada Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Battle Mountain) was converted into the right to receive 0.105 shares of NMC, resulting in the issuance of approximately 24.1 million shares. The Company also exchanged 2.3 million shares of newly issued $3.25 convertible preferred stock for all outstanding shares of Battle Mountain $3.25 convertible preferred stock. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and as such, the consolidated financial statements include Battle Mountains financial data as if Battle Mountain had always been part of NMC. The Company incurred merger expenses totaling $35 million, of which $20 million related to investment advisory and professional fees and $15 million to employee benefit and severance costs. The majority of such expenses were charged to income in 2001. The following table sets forth results of operations of the previously separate companies for the periods before the combination: Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 (In millions) Sales Pre merger: NMC...................................................... $1,554.9 $1,398.9 Battle Mountain.......................................... 254.5 228.2 Post merger:.............................................. $1,809.4 $1,627.1 Net income (loss) applicable to common shares: Pre merger: NMC...................................................... $ (18.9) $ 24.8 Battle Mountain.......................................... (83.4) (126.8) Post merger: $ (102.3) $ (102.0) Niugini Mining and Lihir Gold Merger Battle Mountain held a 50.45% interest in Niugini Mining and, through this interest at December 31, 1999, held a 7.52% in Lihir Gold that operates a gold mine in Papua New Guinea. In February 2000, Lihir Gold merged with Niugini Mining whereby Niugini Mining shareholders received one share of Lihir Gold for each share of Niugini Mining, together with one additional share of Lihir Gold for each A$1.45 of Niugini Minings net cash balance of $54.7 million. As a result of the merger, Battle Mountain received 111.3 million shares of Lihir Gold, representing a 9.74% interest reflected in Marketable securities of Lihir as a cost investment available for sale. Prior to 2000, Niugini Mining was consolidated into the Companys results and its interest in Lihir Gold was accounted for as an equity investment. At December 31, 2000, Lihir securities were written down by $23.9 million as an other than temporary loss resulting from the length of time and extent to which their market value had been less than their cost basis. During 2001, unrealized holding gains of $18.3 million, net of tax, were credited to Other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect the market value increase throughout the year. Operations The Companys sales result from operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Australia. Gold mining requires the use of specialized facilities and technology. The Company relies heavily on such facilities to maintain its production levels. Also, the cash flow and profitability of the Companys current operations are significantly affected by the market price of gold and copper. These commodity prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Companys control. 58 NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newmont Mining Corporation and the more than 50% owned subsidiaries that it controls. The Company also includes its pro rata share of assets, liabilities and operations for unincorporated joint ventures in which it has an interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency for all subsidiaries is the U. S. dollar, except for Canadian and Australian operations where the functional currency is the Canadian and Australian dollar, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of the short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury bills and high quality commercial paper and time deposits. Investments Short term investments that are intended to be held to maturity are carried at cost, which approximates market, and include Eurodollar, government and corporate obligations rated AA or higher. Investments in marketable securities available for sale are marked to market at each period end. Changes in value on such securities are recorded, net of tax, as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss). If declines in value are deemed other than temporary, losses are reflected in Net income (loss). Investments in incorporated entities in which the Companys ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the Company does not control, are accounted for by the equity method and are included in long term assets. Income or loss from such investments is included in Equity income (loss) and impairment of affiliates. Other investments in nonmarketable securities in which the Companys ownership interest is less than 20% and in which the Company has no significant influence are recorded at cost in long term assets. Unrealized gains or losses on these investments are included in Other comprehensive income (loss), while realized gains or losses are included in Net income (loss). Inventories Precious metals, ore and in process inventories, and materials and supplies are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Prior to the change in accounting method for revenue recognition discussed below, precious metals inventory was stated at market value. Property, Plant and Mine Development Expenditures for new facilities or expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives of such facilities. Productive lives range from 2 to 21 years, but do not exceed the related estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves. Mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, future costs incurred to develop such property, including costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body, are capitalized. Such costs, and estimated development costs for the current year, are amortized using the unit of production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on proven and probable reserves. Ongoing development expenditures to maintain production are generally charged to operations as incurred. 59 Significant payments related to the acquisition of land and mineral rights are capitalized. If a mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are amortized when production begins using the unit of production method based on proven and probable reserves. If no mineable ore body is discovered or such rights are otherwise determined to have no value, such costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined the property has no future economic value. Interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Gains or losses from sales or retirements of assets are included in Dividends, interest, and other income. Asset Impairment The Company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined using estimated future cash flow analysis. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed engineering life of mine plans. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. Generally, all assets at a particular mine are used together to generate cash flow. At the Nevada operations, with a number of ore types and processing facilities, assets are grouped according to the processing facility at which ores will be processed. Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions and or the Companys performance could have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations (See Note 16). In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," that established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121 ("Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"), for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement was adopted on January 1, 2002, and there was no impact upon adoption. Revenue Recognition The Company changed its accounting method for revenue recognition in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, such that revenue is recognized upon delivery of third party refined gold to the customer. Previously, revenue was recognized when the production process was complete or when gold was poured in dore form at the mine (See Note 18). Initial proceeds from prepaid forward sales contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized in income when the related gold is delivered. Mining Costs In general, mining costs are charged to operations as incurred. However, certain of the Companys deposits have diverse grade and waste to ore ratios over the mines life. Mining costs for these deposits, to the extent they do not relate to current gold production, are capitalized and then charged to operations when the applicable gold is produced. Reclamation and Remediation Costs Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Such costs related to active mines are accrued and charged over the expected operating lives of the mines using the unit of production method. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on managements best estimate 60 at the end of each period of the undiscounted costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which established a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement will be adopted January 1, 2003, when the Company will record the estimated present value of reclamation liabilities and increase the carrying amount of the related asset. Subsequently, the reclamation costs will be allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. The Company is in the process of quantifying the effect of adoption. Income and Mining Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of the Companys liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates a net deferred income tax liability or net deferred income tax asset for the Company as of the end of the year, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect as enacted. The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in the net deferred income tax liability or net deferred income tax asset balance for the year. Mining taxes represent Canadian provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes since such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. The Companys deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets that it believes will more likely than not fail to be realized. Foreign Currency Assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates in Canada and Australia are translated at exchange rates in effect at each period end. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Accumulated currency translation adjustments are included in Other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in the statement of operations in the period of the transaction. Commodity and Financial Instruments On a limited basis the Company has entered into commodity contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold production. The Company does not acquire, hold or issue commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Put option contracts purchased by the Company provide the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified number of ounces of gold at a specified strike price. Put options qualify for deferral accounting such that gains or losses on the contracts are recognized as the designated production is delivered or as the options expire. The initial fair value of put options is recorded as an asset and is amortized over the term of the options. Call option contracts sold by the Company provide the contract holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified number of ounces of gold at a specified strike price. The call option contracts are recorded at fair value and are marked to market at each reporting date. Certain combination, time matched written call and purchased put options (known as "collars") together provide a minimum and maximum potential price for contract ounces of gold. Premiums paid or received are included in sales revenue in the period such collars expire. The change in the intrinsic value of such instruments is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and the change in the time value is recorded currently in the statement of operations. 61 Forward sales contracts enable the Company to deliver to a counterparty a specified number of ounces of gold at a specified price and date. Gains and losses realized on these contracts, as well as any cost or revenue associated therewith, are recognized in sales when the related gold is delivered. To the extent these contracts provide for (and the Company contemplates) physical delivery of gold, these contracts are not considered derivative instruments. Interest rate swaps are utilized by the Company to reduce interest rate risks. The swaps are recorded at fair value and are recognized as a component of interest expense at each reporting date. The Company hedges its exposure to market fluctuations in fuel prices from time to time. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and as such, gains or losses on the effective portion of these contracts are deferred until the fuel is delivered. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which requires recognition of all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measurement at fair value. Changes in the derivatives fair value are required to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Gains and losses on derivative hedging instruments must be recorded in either other comprehensive income (loss) or current earnings (loss), depending on the nature of the instrument. The Company made no substantive changes to its risk management strategy as a result of adopting SFAS No. 133. Derivative documentation policies were revised as necessary to comply with the new standard. Earnings Per Common Share Earnings or loss per share are presented for basic and diluted net income (loss) and, if applicable, for net income or loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or loss (the numerator) by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares (the denominator) for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share includes the same numerator, but the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive common shares had been issued (such as the common share equivalents for employee stock options). Comprehensive Income In addition to net income, comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period (such as adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of marketable securities held for sale or other investments), except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2001 presentation. 62 NOTE 3 INVENTORIES At December 31, 2001 2000 (In thousands) Current: Ore and in process inventories............................. $ 280,419 $241,181 Precious metals............................................ 10,302 23,452 Materials and supplies..................................... 92,556 95,395 Other...................................................... 925 1,012 $ 384,202 $361,040 Ore in stockpiles classified as Long term inventory......... $ 92,689 $163,782 NOTE 4 PROPERTY, PLANT AND MINE DEVELOPMENT At December 31, 2001 2000 (In thousands) Land and mining claims................................. $ 281,359 $ 277,356 Buildings and equipment................................ 3,491,231 3,138,645 Mine development....................................... 1,054,725 927,516 Construction in progress............................... 97,854 304,846 4,925,169 4,648,363 Accumulated depreciation and depletion.................

Newmont Nusa Tenggara ("PTNNT"), the owner of the Batu Hijau copper/gold mine in Indonesia. PTNNT obtained rights to conduct mining operations under a Contract of Work with the government of Indonesia. Batu Hijau production began in the fourth quarter of 1999, with a projected mine life in excess of 18 years and a development cost of approximately $1.83 billion. The Company and Sumitomo have an indirect 45% and 35% interest, respectively, in PTNNT. The remaining 20% interest is held by an unrelated Indonesian company. Because the Company and Sumitomo have carried the investment of the 20% owner, the Company and Sumitomo recognize 56.25% and 43.75% of Batu Hijaus net income (loss), respectively, until recouping the bulk of its construction investment, including interest. Under the Contract of Work, a portion of PTNNT not already owned by Indonesian nationals must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals, beginning in the sixth year after mining operations commenced. The effect of this provision could potentially reduce the Companys and Sumitomos ownership to 49% by the end of the tenth year. The Company accounts for its investment in Batu Hijau as an equity investment due to each partners significant participating rights in the business and the unanimous approval required for major partnership decisions. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, such investment was $559.8 million and $527.6 million, respectively. Differences between 56.25% of NTPs net assets and the Companys investment include (i) $205 million for the fair market value adjustment recorded by NTP in conjunction with the Companys initial contribution, net of amortization, (ii) $26 million for inter company charges, (iii) $114 million for the fair market value adjustment recorded by the Company in conjunction with the acquisition of a prior minority interest in the Company, net of 63 amortization, and (iv) $140 million for contributions recorded by the Company that were classified as debt by NTP. Certain of these amounts are amortized or depreciated on a unit of production basis. The Companys investment also reflects $42 million for exploration expenditures incurred prior to the formation of NTP. (See Note 17 for a description of the Companys equity loss in Batu Hijau. Batu Hijaus Net income (loss) reflects the elimination of interest between PTNNT and NTP). Batu Hijau development was funded by $1.0 billion from third party loans ("Senior Debt") and $0.83 billion from the Company and Sumitomo. The Senior Debt was guaranteed by the Company and Sumitomo, 56.25% and 43.75%, respectively, until project completion tests were met in October 2000, at which time the debt became non recourse to the Company. Repayment of borrowings under the Senior Debt is scheduled for semi annual installments of $43.5 million from May 2001 through November 2010. The semi annual installments will be reduced to $22.1 million from May 2011 through November 2013. The interest rate is based on blended fixed and floating rates. The weighted average interest rates were 6.7% and 6.6% during 2001 and 2000, respectively, and 5.1% and 7.0% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In May 2001, PTNNT entered into a non recourse term loan for $22.5 million, maturing May 15, 2005. Interest on the term loan is paid semi annually in May and November and is based on the six month LIBOR plus 2%. At December 31, 2001, the term loan interest rate was 4.2% and the effective interest rate was 5.7% for 2001. Newmont and Sumitomo have a contingent obligation to provide a $125 million support facility on a pro rata basis, if required, and as of December 31, 2001, $9 million had been provided by the Company under this facility. The Company and Sumitomo will be required to provide additional funds under this contingent support facility during 2002. The amount of this contingent support will depend on copper and gold prices, necessary capital expenditures at Batu Hijau, and required principal and interest payments. Following is summarized financial information for NTP based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The results of operations and assets and liabilities of NTP are not reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As described above, the Company accounts for NTP as an equity investment.

Sale Leaseback of the Refractory Ore Treatment Plant In September 1994, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback agreement for its refractory ore treatment plant located at Carlin, Nevada. The transaction was accounted for as debt and the cost of the refractory ore treatment plant was recorded as a depreciable asset. The lease term is 21 years and aggregate future minimum lease payments, which include interest, were $489.7 million and $519.4 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Principal payments are $29.7 million annually over the next four years, increasing to $35.5 in the fifth year and beyond. The lease includes purchase options during and at the end of the lease at predetermined prices. The interest rate on this sale leaseback transaction is 6.36%. In connection with this transaction, the Company entered into certain interest rate hedging contracts that were settled for a gain of $11 million, which is recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the lease. Including this gain, the effective interest rate on the borrowing is 6.15%. Because this asset is specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. Credit Facilities The Companys $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into June 1997, was replaced in October 2001 with two unsecured multi currency revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 million facility 67 with an initial term of 364 days, which may be extended annually to October 2006; and a $400 million revolving facility, which matures in October 2006. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the Companys credit rating. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 0.77% to 1.25% or the greater of the federal funds rate or the lead banks prime rate. Annual fees vary from 0.10% to 0.30%. At December 31, 2001, the fees were 0.15% and 0.175% of the commitment, for the $200 million and the $400 million facility, respectively. The facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified limitations on debt to capitalization, debt to "earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization," incurring liens and transactions with affiliates. There were no borrowings under the new facilities as of December 31, 2001. The Company is in compliance with all financial debt covenants. 8 3/8% Debentures Unsecured debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million maturing July 1, 2005, bearing an annual interest rate of 8.375% were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable semi annually in January and July and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The costs related to the issuance of the debentures were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the debentures. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these debentures was approximately $205.9 million and $202.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 8 5/8% Notes Unsecured notes with a principal amount of $150 million due April 1, 2002, bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625% were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable semi annually in April and October and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these notes was $151.2 million and $153.9 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In May 2001, Newmont issued unsecured notes with a principal amount of $275 million due May 2011 bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625%. Proceeds of $272 million, after transaction costs, were used to repay debt outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility, with the remainder for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in May and November and the notes are redeemable prior to maturity under certain conditions. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these notes was $275.9 million at December 31, 2001. 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Unsecured debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million maturing January 2005 bearing an annual interest rate of 6% were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable annually in January and the debentures are convertible at the option of the holders into shares of common stock at any time on or after January 10, 2001 and prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed at the option of the Company. The conversion rate is 25.45 shares for each $5,000 principal amount of debentures converted. Approximately 509,000 shares of common stock have been registered for issuance upon conversion of these debentures. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these debentures was approximately $100.0 million and $82.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Medium Term Notes Unsecured notes with a principal amount of $32 million maturing on various dates beginning early 2003 to late 2004, bearing an annual weighted average interest rate of 7.68%, were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable semi annually in March and September and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these notes was $32.7 million and $31.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 68 Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) Loan Battle Mountain Canada entered into a $145.0 million loan with CIBC in conjunction with its purchase of Niugini Mining that was secured by Niugini Mining stock. In January 2001, the loan was paid in full with a $40 million collateral cash account and from the Companys revolving credit facility. The interest rates were variable and the weighted average interest rate was 7.6% for 2000. Interest Rate Swaps During the last half of 2001, the Company entered into contracts to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its $275 million 8 5/8% notes and its $200 million 8 3/8% debentures. The Company receives fixed rate interest payments at 8 5/8% or 8 3/8% and pays floating rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 4.25%. The notional principal amount of these transactions (representing the amount of principal tied to floating interest rate exposure) was $200 million at December 31, 2001. Half of these contracts expire in July 2005 and half expire in May 2011. These transactions have been designated as fair value hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $0.6 million. The fair value of the related debt was also adjusted to reduce the liability by a corresponding amount. At December 31, 2001, these transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $0.8 million. Project Financings Minera Yanacocha Trust Certificates: Minera Yanacocha issued debt through the sale of $100 million 8.4% Series A Trust Certificates to various institutional investors. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, $64.0 million and $78.0 million, respectively, was outstanding under the financing. Interest on the Certificates is fixed at 8.4% and repayments are required quarterly through 2004. The Certificates are secured by certain of Minera Yanacochaa assets, certain restricted funds and also are specifically secured by future gold sales, through a trust agreement with the Bank of New York. Because these Certificates are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. $100 million Credit Facility: In December 1999, Minera Yanacocha entered into a $100 million credit facility with the International Finance Corporation. The two tier facility (a $20 million A Tranche and a $80 million B Tranche) is revolving and converts into term loans. The A Tranche has a five year revolving availability period and converts to a five year term loan. The B Tranche has a three year revolving availability period and converts to a four year term loan. Initial drawdowns under the loan were used for development of the La Quinua project; however, the loan accommodates repayments during the revolving availability period and any subsequent borrowings may be used for other development purposes. Interest applicable to the A Tranche is based on LIBOR plus 2.375%. Interest applicable to the B Tranche is based on LIBOR plus 2.0% through the second anniversary of the agreement, LIBOR plus 2.25% from year two to year four and after the fourth anniversary LIBOR plus 2.5%. The A Tranche interest rate was 5.5% and 8.3% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average rate was 7.7% and 8.3% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The B Tranche interest rate was 5.2% and 8.3% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average rate was 7.3% and 8.3% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The outstanding amount under this credit line was $100.0 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001 and 2000. $20 million Credit Facility: Minera Yanocaha has a $20 million line of credit with Banco de Credito del Peru that expires in July 2004. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 2% and is adjusted annually to current market rates. The interest rate was 4.6% and 8.6 % at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average interest rate was 6.5% and 8.6% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The outstanding amount under this credit line was $13.0 million and $8.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001 and 2000. 69 Leases: In December 1999, Minera Yanacocha assumed certain lease and purchase agreements for mining equipment that expire at various dates from December 2002 to June 2006. The net present value of future minimum payments was $6.3 million and $8.3 million, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with an interest component of 8.7% and 11.1% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Because these assets are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. All Minera Yanacocha debt is non recourse to the Company and is secured by substantially all of Minera Yanacochas property, plant and equipment; see above for specific security on the Trust Certificates. Zarafshan Newmont The Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, is a 50% participant in the Zarafshan Newmont joint venture ("Zarafshan Newmont") in the Republic of Uzbekistan. The other participants are two Uzbek government entities. Zarafshan Newmont has a loan with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("EBRD") secured by the assets of the project. The outstanding amount was $12.0 million and $18.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loan is to be repaid in semi annual installments of $6.0 million, which began in July 2001. The interest rate is based on the three month LIBOR plus 4.25%. The weighted average interest rates were 8.7% and 10.9% for 2001 and 2000, respectively, and the interest rates at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were 6.1% and 11.0%, respectively. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001 and 2000. In December 2000, Zarafshan Newmont completed an additional $30 million loan under the EBRD facility that will be used primarily for capital expansion. The outstanding amount on this loan was $30.0 million at December 31, 2001, of which $15 million was the Companys share. No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2000. The loan facility will be available through December 15, 2002 and will be repaid in eight equal semi annual payments of $3.75 million, beginning July 2003 and ending January 2007. The interest rate is based on the three month LIBOR plus 3.25%. The interest rate was 5.1% at December 31, 2001 and the weighted average interest rate was 8.3% for 2001. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001. The assets of Zarafshan Newmont secure both loans and in addition, the Company has guaranteed 50% of the loans and the Uzbek partners have guaranteed the remaining 50%. Inti Raymi In conjunction with the development of its Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia, Inti Raymi arranged a term credit facility with various international lending institutions with a fixed interest rate of 10.25%. The loan was paid in full in June 2001. In 2001, Inti Raymi entered into a capital lease for mining equipment that expires in May 2003. The net present value of the lease payments was $2.5 million at December 31, 2001, with an interest component of 10.25%. Because these assets are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. Capitalized Interest Capitalized interest was $10.6 million, $5.5 million and $23.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. NOTE 9 SALES CONTRACTS, COMMODITY AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Option Contracts and Price Capped Sales Contracts In late July and early August 1999, the Company purchased put option contracts for 2.85 million ounces of gold, with a strike price of $270 per ounce. This purchase was paid for by selling call option contracts for 2.35 70 million ounces at the strike prices noted below. Put option contracts for one million ounces were subject to termination if the market price reached $270 per ounce at any time prior to such contracts expiration dates, which were August 2000 through July 2001. These put option contracts were thus terminated in September 1999. The put options qualified for deferral accounting such that gains and losses on the contracts were recognized as the designated production was delivered or as the options expired. The initial fair value of the options of $37.6 million was recorded as put option premiums and was amortized over the term of the options. In 2000 and 1999, $19.1 million and $18.5 million, respectively, was amortized in Sales, including the premiums associated with terminated put options. The call option contracts, with an initial fair value of $37.6 million, were marked to market at each reporting date. Noncash gains of $1.8 million and $26.8 million were recorded in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and a loss of $44.8 million was recorded in 1999. In September 2001, the Company entered into transactions that closed out these call options. The options were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under the terms of the contracts, Newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $350 per ounce in 2005 to $392 per ounce in 2011. The value of the sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. As of December 31, 2001, the following price capped sales contracts were outstanding: Sold Call Options Price Ozs Cap 2005.......................................................... 500,000 $ 350 2008.......................................................... 1,000,000 $ 384 2009.......................................................... 600,000 $ 381 2011.......................................................... 250,000 $ 392 Prepaid Forward Sales Contracts In July 1999, the Company entered into a prepaid forward sale contract for approximately 483,000 ounces of gold, with initial proceeds of $137.2 million, for delivery in June 2005, 2006 and 2007. Such proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized in income when the related gold is physically delivered. Any additional proceeds will be determined at each delivery date based on the excess of the then existing market price (not to exceed $380 per ounce) over $300 per ounce. The prepaid forward sale contract also included semi annual delivery requirements of approximately 17,950 ounces beginning June 2000 through June 2007. Newmont entered into forward purchase contracts at prices increasing from $263 per ounce in 2000 to $354 per ounce in 2007 to coincide with these semi annual delivery commitments. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and at December 31, 2001 had a negative fair value of $3.7 million. Commodity Instruments In December 2001, the Company entered into a series of equal and offsetting positions to its commodity instruments for certain Battle Mountain operations that were outstanding at that time. These contracts effectively closed out its combination matched put and call options and flat forward contracts. 71 The offsetting positions were designated as fair value hedges and are marked to market in current earnings. As a result, the following were outstanding as of December 31, 2001: 2002 2003 2004 Total/Average Combination call and put options: Written call options: Ounces...................................... 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce.............. $ 348 $ 348 $ 359 $ 348 Purchased call options: Ounces...................................... 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce.............. $ 348 $ 348 $ 359 $ 348 Purchased put options: Ounces...................................... 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce.............. $ 286 $ 286 $ 296 $ 286 Written put options: Ounces...................................... 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce.............. $ 286 $ 286 $ 296 $ 286 Flat forward contracts: Ounces...................................... 31,252 31,252 1,563 64,067 Average price per ounce..................... $ 314 $ 314 $ 323 $ 314 Forward purchase contracts: Ounces...................................... 31,252 31,252 1,563 64,067 Average price per ounce..................... $ 314 $ 314 $ 323 $ 314 The Company is not required to place collateral with respect to its commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. Credit risk is minimized by contracting only with major financial institutions/counterparties. These instruments had offsetting fair values at December 31, 2001. The combination call and put options contracts had a fair value of $2.7 million at December 31, 2000. The flat forward contracts had a negative fair value of $2.0 million at December 31, 2000. Fuel Contracts The Company uses certain derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its exposure to fuel price market fluctuations, from time to time. At December 31, 2001, the Company had contracts expiring September 2002 covering approximately 8.6 million gallons of diesel fuel at its Nevada operations at prices ranging from approximately $0.61 to $0.69 per gallon. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $1.3 million.

As discussed in Note 1, NMC issued 24.1 million shares in exchange for Battle Mountain common stock and Battle Mountain exchangeable shares in January 2001. The Company paid dividends of $0.12 per common share of NMC stock in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999. Convertible Preferred Stock: At December 31, 2001 and 2000, 2.3 million shares of $3.25 convertible preferred stock were outstanding, with a liquidation preference of $50 per share. In conjunction with the NMC/Battle Mountain merger, NMC issued 2.3 million shares of $3.25 convertible preferred stock in exchange for Battle Mountain preferred stock. The preferred stock is convertible into shares of NMC at any time at a conversion ratio of 0.5 share of NMC common stock and is redeemable at the option of the Company solely for shares of NMC common stock. Pursuant to the restructuring of the Company described above, preferred stockholders were granted voting rights. Holders of NMC convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Companys board of directors, an annual cash dividend of $3.35 per share, payable in equal quarterly installments. The Company paid $7.5 million in preferred stock dividends in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999. Stock Rights. In September 2000, the Company paid a dividend of one series A junior participating preferred stock purchase right ("PSPR") for each outstanding share of NMC common stock. These rights replaced NMCs existing PSPRs that expired in September 2000. The rights agreement works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group, which acquires 15% or more of NMCs outstanding common stock without the approval of its board of directors. Each PSPR entitles the holder to purchase from NMC one one thousandth of a share of NMC participating preferred stock for $100 (subject to adjustment) once such rights become exercisable. Until exercised, holders of PSPRs have no stockholder rights. The PSPRs become exercisable only if a defined acquiring person has acquired 15% or more of NMC common stock or has begun a tender or exchange offer that would result in such person owning 15% or more of NMC common stock. If such events occur, PSPR holders (other than the acquiring person) may, for $100, purchase shares of NMC common stock (or in certain circumstances common stock of the acquiring company) with a market value of $200, based on the market price of NMC common stock prior to such acquisition (or the market price of the acquiring corporations stock). NMC may redeem the PSPRs for $0.01 each prior to an announcement that a defined acquiring person exists. The PSPRs remain in place following the restructuring described in Note 1. NOTE 12 STOCK OPTIONS Employee Stock Options Under the Companys stock option plans, options to purchase shares of stock have been granted to key employees at the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant. The options under these plans vest over a two year period and, for certain options granted to key employees, over a four year period, and are exercisable over a period not exceeding ten years. At December 31, 2001, 5,472,645 shares were available for future grants under the Companys plans. In conjunction with the Battle Mountain merger, 850,000 shares of NMC common stock were authorized for issuance in connection with outstanding Battle Mountain stock options that were assumed by the Company. 73 The following table summarizes annual activity for all stock options for each of the three years in the period ended December 31: 2001 2000 1999 Weighted Weighted Weighted Average Average Average Number of Exercise Number of Exercise Number of Exercise Shares Price Shares Price Shares Price All Stock Options Outstanding at beginning of year................ 12,671,674 $29 11,511,797 $30 6,559,745 $38 Granted................. 1,439,548 $22 1,502,325 $19 5,253,469 $19 Exercised...............

In addition, the same executives were granted options with exercise prices in excess of the fair market value on the date of grant. Generally, these key executive options vest over a period of one to five years and are exercisable over a ten year period. At December 31, 2001, 503,354 of these options were outstanding and 266,714 were exercisable. Information about these stock options outstanding (included in the "All Stock Options" table) at December 31, 2001 is summarized below: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Weighted Average Weighted Weighted Range of Remaining Average Average Exercise Number Contractual Exercise Number Exercise Prices Outstanding Life Price Exercisable Price Options with exercise prices in excess of the fair market value on the date of the grant ....................... $40 to $56 266,714 1.5 years $ 50 266,714 $ 50 Options that cannot be exercised until the market price exceeds a fixed amount above the exercise price......... $30 to $41 236,640 1.6 years $ 37 $ 74 The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. Accordingly, because stock option exercise prices equal the market value on the date of grant, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock options. Had compensation cost for the options been determined based on market value at grant dates in 2001, 2000 and 1999 as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands, except per share): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net loss applicable to common shares As reported................................... $(30,754) $(102,349) $(102,040) Pro forma..................................... $(32,199) $(129,719) $(129,086) Net loss per share, basic and diluted As reported................................... $ (0.16) $ (0.53) $ (0.53) Pro forma..................................... $ (0.16) $ (0.67) $ (0.67) For purposes of determining the pro forma amounts, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: weighted average risk free interest rates of 4.9%, 6.4% and 6.4%; dividend yield of 0.6% for all three years; expected lives of nine years, nine years and eight years; and volatility of 49%, 56% and 52%. Compensation costs included in the pro forma amounts reflect only fair values of options granted after January 1, 1995. These amounts may not be indicative of actual results had the Company used fair value based accounting for stock options. Other Stock Based Compensation In 1997, the Company adopted an intermediate term incentive plan ("ITIP") under which restricted stock may be granted to certain key employees. These shares are granted upon achievement of certain financial and operating thresholds at fair market value on the grant date. ITIP stock grants are subject to certain restrictions related to ownership and transferability that currently lapse two years (for ownership) and, in some cases, five years (for transfer) from the date of the grant. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, 248,601, 95,814 and 62,800 shares of restricted stock, respectively, were issued under ITIP, of which 254,491 shares remain restricted at December 31, 2001. Compensation expense recorded for these grants was $3.3 million, $2.4 million and $1.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2001, the Company adopted a deferred stock award plan under which deferred stock awards are granted to employees. The employees vest in the awards after two years, at which time the related shares are issued free of any restrictions. In 2001, deferred stock awards were granted equivalent to 214,000 shares of stock, of which 210,287 remain outstanding at December 31, 2001. Compensation expense recorded for these grants was $ 0.8 million in 2001. NOTE 13 EMPLOYEE PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Pension Plans The Companys pension plans include: (1) two qualified non contributory defined benefit plans (for salaried employees and substantially all domestic hourly employees); (2) two non qualified plans (for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal legislation); and (3) a non qualified cash balance international plan (for select employees who are not eligible to participate in the U.S. based plans because of citizenship). The vesting period for each plan is five years of service. The plans benefit formulas are based on an employees years of credited service and either (1) such employees last five years average pay (salaried plan), (2) a percentage of annual pay (international plan) or (3) a flat dollar amount adjusted by a service weighted multiplier (hourly plan). 75 Pension costs are determined annually by independent actuaries and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based on funding standards established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Other Benefit Plans The Company provides defined medical benefits to qualified retirees (and to their eligible dependents) who were salaried employees and defined life insurance benefits to qualified retirees who were salaried employees. In general, participants become eligible for these benefits upon retirement directly from the Company if they are at least 55 years old and the combination of their age and years of service with the Company equals 75 or more. Defined medical benefits cover most of the reasonable and customary charges for hospital, surgical, diagnostic and physician services and prescription drugs. Life insurance benefits are based on a percentage of final base annual salary and decline over time after retirement commences. The following tables provide a reconciliation of changes in the plans benefit obligations and assets fair values for the two year period ended December 31, 2001 and a statement of the funded status as of December 31 of both years: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2001 2000 2001 2000 (In thousands) (In thousands) Change in Benefit Obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year................................. $189,346 $181,743 $ 45,062 $ 49,322 Service cost benefits earned during the year............................. 8,075 7,530 2,422 2,570 Interest cost......................... 14,545 13,631 3,700 3,209 Amendments............................ 2,860 Actuarial loss (gain)................. 12,396 5,406 8,166 (8,573) Benefit enhancements for early retirement........................... 15,682 1,311 Settlement gain.......................

(120) 143 Accrued cost.......................... $(30,477) $(11,701) $(73,775) $(68,906) The Companys qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") rules and regulations. The Companys non qualified and other benefit plans are not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. The information contained in the above tables indicates the 76 combined funded status of qualified and non qualified plans, in accordance with accounting pronouncements. Assumptions used for IRS purposes differ from those used for accounting purposes. The funded status shown above, prepared in accordance with accounting pronouncements, compares the projected benefit obligation of all plans, which is an actuarial present value of obligations that takes into account assumptions as to future compensation levels of plan participants, to the fair value of the assets held in trust for the qualified plans. Accounting pronouncements also prescribe a computation for the plans accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO"), which is an actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or nonvested) attributed to employees based on employee service and compensation prior to the end of the period presented. The following plans have an ABO in excess of the market value of plan assets: (1) qualified and non qualified pension plans for salaried employees, (2) the qualified pension plan for hourly employees and (3) the non qualified international pension plan. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, the ABO was $149.2 million and $100.2 million for the qualified pension plan for salaried employees, $17.4 million and $14.4 million for the qualified pension plan for hourly employees, $15.8 million and $15.7 million for the non qualified pension plan for salaried employees, and $2.4 million and $2.2 million for the non qualified international pension plan. The following table provides amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2001 2000 2001 2000 (In thousands) (In thousands) Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets: Accrued benefit cost................. $(38,555) $(21,923) $(73,775) $(68,906) Intangible asset..................... 5,014 6,357 Accumulated other comprehensive income.............................. 3,064 3,865 Net amount recognized................ $(30,477) $(11,701) $(73,775) $(68,906) In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, an adjustment was required to reflect a minimum liability for the non qualified pension plan in 2001, 2000 and 1999, and one of the hourly pension plans and the international plan in 2001. As a result of such adjustment, an intangible asset was recorded and (to the extent the minimum liability adjustment exceeded the unrecognized net transition liability) Stockholders equity was reduced $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $3.5 million (net of related deferred income tax benefits) at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The following table provides components of net periodic pension benefit cost for the indicated fiscal years: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) (In thousands) Components of net periodic pension benefit cost: Service cost.............. $ 8,075 $ 7,530 $ 9,358 $2,422 $2,569 $4,022 Interest cost............. 14,545 13,631 12,723 3,700 3,209 3,511 Expected return on plan assets...................

Gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants. Postretirement benefits other than pensions are accrued during an employees service to the Company. 77 Assumptions used in measuring the Companys benefit obligation were as follows: Pension Other Benefits Benefits 2001 2000 2001 2000 Weighted average assumptions as of December 31: Discount rate.......................................... 7.25% 7.75% 7.25% 7.75% Expected return on plan assets......................... 9.25% 9.25% N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase.......................... 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% The assumed health care cost trend rate to measure the expected cost of benefits was 8% for 2002, 7% for 2003, 6% for 2004 and 5% each year thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on amounts reported for the health care plans. A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 1% 1% Increase Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement health care benefit cost....... $1,409 $(1,109) Effect on the health care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.......................... $8,367 $(6,360) Savings Plan The Company has four qualified defined contribution savings plans, two that cover salaried employees and two that cover substantially all hourly employees. In addition, the Company has two non qualified supplemental savings plans for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee contributions of up to 6% and 4% of base salary for the salaried and hourly plans, respectively. Matching contributions are made with NMC stock; however, no holding restrictions are placed on such contributions, which totaled $9.9 million in both 2001 and 2000, and $9.7 million in 1999.

The Company issued $40 million of NMC common stock, 2.6 million shares, under terms of the settlement, and charged $42.2 million, including expenses, to income. NOTE 16 WRITE DOWN OF ASSETS In 2001, the Company reduced the carrying value of its long lived assets by $41.0 million pre tax. The write down related to Minahasa ($18.9 million), Nevada ($11.7 million), Kori Kollo ($4.8 million) and the San 78 Luis property in Colorado ($3.5 million). This write down of long lived assets represented the excess carrying value of assets compared to fair value, with fair value determined using discounted future cash flow analyses. Such cash flows are based on estimated recoverable ounces, future production and capital costs, and gold price assumptions. Gold price assumptions were $285 per ounce in 2002 and $300 per ounce thereafter. The Minahasa write down reduced fixed assets by $12.1 million, increased reclamation liabilities by $3.7 million, and reduced ore stockpile and materials and supply inventories by $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Nevada write down reduced ore and in process inventory by $7.3 million and fixed assets by $4.4 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced fixed assets by $4.8 million. The San Luis write down reduced fixed assets by $2.0 million and materials and supply inventory by $1.5 million. The write downs had no impact on the scope of the these operations and will reduce future pre tax Costs applicable to sales by $16.9 million and Depreciation and depletion by $24.1 million based on remaining production as of December 31, 2001, with no impact on future cash flows. In 2000, the write down of $58.4 million related to the Holloway mine in Canada ($30.8 million), the short lived Mesquite mine in California ($14.8 million), the Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia ($5.6 million), the acquisition cost of the Mezcala property in Mexico ($6.5 million) and the Battle Mountain Complex in Nevada ($0.7 million). The Holloway write down reduced fixed assets by $30.8 million. Mesquites write down reduced leach pad inventory by $9.7 million, capitalized mining by $1.4 million and fixed assets by $3.7 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced inventory by $4.9 million and fixed assets by $0.7 million. In 1999, the write down of $39.5 million related to the Crown Jewel project in Washington ($36.0 million) and to Nevada stockpile inventories ($3.5 million). The Crown Jewel write down related to mine development costs and represented the remaining carrying value of the property as a result of permitting uncertainties resulting from a January 2000 decision from the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board decision that reversed its water rights permits and vacated its Clean Water Act certification.

(76,170) Total............................................. $32,981 $(9,923) $(91,627) Financial information relating to the Companys equity investment in Batu Hijau was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) Sales....................................... $ 447,291 $ 431,323 $ 15,213 Interest income............................. $ 1,007 $ 546 $ 11 Interest expense............................ $ 120,389 $ 139,722 $ 17,145 Depreciation and amortization............... $ 101,012 $ 81,623 $ 8,846 Net income (loss)........................... $ (16,215) $ (98,644) $ 10,274 Capital expenditures........................ $ 49,334 $ 158,783 $ 607,868 Total assets at December 31,................ $2,194,476 $2,228,487 $2,107,614 The equity income in Batu Hijau was $33.0 million in 2001 (based on 56.25% of Batu Hijaus net loss of $16.2 million plus $26.4 million of eliminated inter company interest, $10.8 million for eliminated management fees, and $4.9 million for other items). In 2000, the Companys equity loss in Batu Hijau was $9.9 million (based on 56.25% of Batu Hijaus net loss of $98.6 million plus $29.2 million of eliminated inter company interest, $12.5 million for eliminated management fees, and $3.9 million for other items). In 1999, the equity loss in Batu 79 Hijau was $10.7 million (based on 56.25% of Batu Hijaus net income of $10.3 million plus $5.2 million of eliminated intercompany interest, reduced by $20.6 million to reclassify deferred tax benefits and increased by $1.2 million for other items). As described in Note 1, Lihir Gold was accounted for as an equity investment prior to 2000. The Company recorded $76.2 million in 1999 for impairment losses resulting from declines in Lihir Golds market value. Beginning in 2000, Lihir Gold stock was carried as marketable equity securities held for sale and as of December 31, 2000, was written down $23.9 million as an other than temporary loss resulting from the length of time and extent to which their market value had been less than their cost basis. During 2001, unrealized holding gains of $18.3 million were charged to Other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect market value increases throughout the year. NOTE 18 ACCOUNTING CHANGES As described in Note 2, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2000, effective January 1, 2000, to record sales upon delivery of third party refined gold to the customer. Previously, revenue was recognized upon the completion of the production process, or when gold was poured into dore at the mine site. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2000 was $12.6 million, net of tax and minority interest. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," to recognize derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value. As a result, the Company increased Other comprehensive income by $1.7 million as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method. NOTE 19 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Net cash provided by operating activities included the following cash payments: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) Income taxes, net of refunds........................... $76,020 $86,608 $28,500 Interest, net of amounts capitalized................... $81,952 $91,510 $73,422 In the third quarter of 2001, NMC entered into transactions that closed out certain written call option contracts with a series of price capped contracts as described in Note 9. These transactions resulted in a non cash increase of $53.8 million to Deferred revenue from sale of future production for the initial fair value of these contracts. In 2001 and 2000, Kori Kollo and Minera Yanacocha, respectively, entered into certain leases (see Note 8) that resulted in a non cash increase to Property, plant and mine development and Long term debt ($3.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively). In 2000, NMC issued 2.6 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the acquisition settlement described in Note 15 that resulted in non cash increases to Common stock ($4.2 million) and additional paid in capital ($35.8 million). In December 1999, Minera Yanacocha assumed certain equipment lease and purchase agreements (see Note 8) that resulted in a non cash increase to Property, plant and mine development and Long term debt ($12.4 million). In the third quarter of 1999, NMC entered into two put and call option contracts described in Note 9. As a result, non cash increases to put option premiums and Fair value of written call options ($37.6 million) were recorded for the initial fair value of these contracts. 80 NOTE 20 SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION The Company predominantly operates in a single industry as a worldwide corporation engaged in gold production, exploration for gold and acquisition of gold properties. The Company has operations in North America, South America, Indonesia, Uzbekistan and Australia, and its reportable segments are based on the geographic location of these operations.

In 2001, sales to two customers totaled $816 million and $326 million or 49% and 20% of total sales, respectively. In 2000, sales to one customer totaled $1.1 billion or 62% of total sales. In 1999, sales to two customers totaled $771 million and $531 million or 47% and 32%, respectively. 82 NOTE 21 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Environmental Obligations The Companys mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At Decemer 31, 2001 and 2000, $128.4 million and $108.9 million, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Companys best estimate of its liability for these matters, $57.3 million and $63.5 million were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These amounts are included in Other accrued liabilities and Reclamation and remediation liabilities. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 50% greater or 30% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2001. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Costs and expenses, Other in the period estimates are revised. Details about certain of the more significant sites involved are discussed below. Idarado Mining Company ("Idarado") 80.1% owned In July 1992, the Company and Idarado signed a consent decree with the State of Colorado ("State"), which was agreed to by the U.S. District Court of Colorado, to settle a lawsuit brought by the State under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), generally referred to as the "Superfund Act." Idarado agreed in the consent decree to undertake specified remediation work at its former mining site in the Telluride/Ouray area of Colorado. Remediation work at this property is substantially complete. If the remediation does not achieve specific performance objectives defined in the consent decree, the State may require Idarado to implement supplemental activities at the site, also as defined in the consent decree. Idarado and the Company have obtained a $5.8 million reclamation bond to secure their potential obligations under the consent decree. In addition, Idarado settled natural resources damages and past and future response costs, and agreed to habitat enhancement work, under the consent decree. Resurrection Mining Company ("Resurrection") 100% owned The Company, Resurrection and other defendants were named in lawsuits filed by the State of Colorado under the Superfund Act in 1983, which were subsequently consolidated with a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") in 1986. These proceedings sought to compel the defendants to remediate the impacts of pre existing, historic mining activities near Leadville, Colorado, which date back to the mid 1800s, and which the government agencies claim are causing substantial environmental problems in the area. In 1988 and 1989, the EPA issued administrative orders with respect to one area on the site, and the defendants have collectively implemented those orders by constructing a water treatment plant, which was placed 83 in operation in early 1992. Remaining remedial work for this area primarily consists of water treatment plant operation and continuing environmental monitoring and maintenance activities. The Company and Resurrection are currently responsible for 50 percent of these costs; their share of such costs could increase in the event other defendants become unable to pay their share of such costs. The parties also have entered into a consent decree with respect to the remaining areas at the site, which apportions liabilities and responsibilities for these areas. The EPA has approved remedial actions for selected components of Resurrections portion of the site, which were initiated in 1995. The EPA has not yet selected the final remedy for the site. Accordingly, the Company cannot yet determine the full extent or cost of its share of the remedial action that will be required. The government agencies may also seek to recover for damages to natural resources. In March 1999, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") to facilitate the settlement of natural resources damages claims under CERCLA for the upper Arkansas River Basin. The MOU provides a structure for evaluation of damages and possible restoration activities that may be required if it is concluded such damages have occurred. Dawn Mining Company LLC ("Dawn") 51% owned Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the EPA. Dawn also owns a nearby uranium millsite facility, located on private land, which is subject to federal and state regulation. In 1991, Dawns mining lease at the mine was terminated. As a result, Dawn was required to file a formal mine closure and reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an analysis of Dawns proposed plan and alternate closure and reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been suspended indefinitely. In mid 2000, the mine was included on the National Priorities List under CERCLA, and the EPA has initiated a remedial investigation/feasibility study under CERCLA to determine environmental conditions and remediation options at the site. The EPA has asserted that Dawn and the Company are liable for reclamation or remediation work and costs at the mine. Dawn does not have sufficient funds to pay for the reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan, or for any additional remediation work or costs at the mine. The Company will vigorously contest any claims as to its liability. The Company cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future action against Dawn or the Company arising from this matter. In late 1999, Dawn initiated state approval for a revised mill closure plan that, if implemented, would expedite the reclamation process at the mill. The State of Washington has approved this revised plan. The currently approved plan for the mill is secured by a $14.1 million bond, which is guaranteed by the Company. San Luis, Colorado 100% owned The San Luis open pit gold mine in southern Colorado was operated by a subsidiary of Battle Mountain and ceased operations in November 1996. Since then, substantial closure and reclamation work has been performed. In August 1999, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment ("CDPHE") issued a notice of violation of the Water Quality Control Act, and in October 1999 amended the notice to authorize operation of a water treatment facility and the discharge of treated water. Battle Mountain has made all submittals required by the CDPHE notice and has conducted the required response activities. Battle Mountain negotiated a settlement with CDPHE resolving alleged violations, which became effective September 1, 2000. In October 2000, the CDPHE received an "Application for Reconsideration of Order for Civil Penalty," filed by project opponents, seeking to appeal the terms of the settlement. The application was denied by CDPHE. Project opponents have filed a judicial appeal in the District Court for Costilla County, Colorado, naming the CDPHE as defendant. Battle Mountain has intervened in the appeal to protect its interests in the settlement. The Company 84 cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of this or any future action against Battle Mountain or the Company relating to this site. Guarantee of Third Party Indebtedness The Company guaranteed a former subsidiarys $35.7 million Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, due 2009. The former subsidiary is BHP Copper Inc., formerly known as Magma Copper Company. It is expected that the Company will be required to remain liable on this guarantee as long as the bonds remain outstanding; however, the Company has not been required to pay any of these amounts, nor does it expect to have to pay any in the future. Other Commitments and Contingencies In June 2000, a transport contractor of Minera Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles southwest of the mine. Mercury is a byproduct of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instrumentation and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Minera Yanacocha. In August 2000, Minera Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 soles (approximately US$500,000) to the Peruvian government. Minera Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. In addition, it has entered into agreements with three of the communities impacted by this incident to provide a variety of public works as compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident. On September 10, 2001, Minera Yanacocha, various wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, and other defendants were named in a lawsuit filed by over 900 Peruvian citizens in Denver District Court for the State of Colorado. This action seeks compensatory and punitive damages based on claims associated with the mercury spill incident. Estimated costs of $10 million for public works, remediation efforts, personal compensation and the fine were included in Other expense in 2000. Neither the Company nor Minera Yanacocha can reasonably predict the likelihood of any additional expenditures related to this matter. In a 1993 asset exchange, a wholly owned subsidiary transferred a coal lease under which the subsidiary had collected advance royalty payments totaling $484 million. From 1994 to 2018, remaining advance payments under the lease to the transferee total $390 million. In the event of title failure as stated in the lease, this subsidiary has a primary obligation to refund previously collected payments and has a secondary obligation to refund any of the $390 million collected by the transferee, if the transferee fails to meet its refund obligation. The subsidiary has no direct liability to the lessor and has title insurance on the leased coal deposits of $240 million covering the secondary obligation. The Company and the subsidiary regard the circumstances entitling the lessor to a refund as remote. The Company has agreed to maintain the subsidiarys net worth at $108 million until July 1, 2025. The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid as a minimum royalty (where production royalties are less than the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty requirements. At December 31, 2001, there were $131.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds primarily for bonding reclamation plans and reinsurance agreements. The surety bonds and letters of credit reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees competitively determined in the marketplace. NMC is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts which may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 85 NOTE 22 UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Quarterly Data The following is a summary of selected quarterly financial information (in millions except per share amounts): 2001 Three Months Ended Year Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, December 31, Sales................... $ 424.1 $ 362.4 $ 424.4 $ 445.2 $1,656.1 Gross profit(/1/)(/2/).. $ 81.1 $ 31.0 $ 71.1 $ 79.9 $ 263.1 Net income (loss) applicable to common shares................. $ (39.2) $ (33.4) $ 21.6 $ 20.2 $ (30.8) Net income (loss) per common share, basic and diluted ............... $ ( 0.20) $ (0.17) $ 0.11 $ 0.10 $ (0.16) Basic weighted average shares outstanding..... 192.6 195.6 195.9 196.1 195.1 Dividends declared per NMC common share....... $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.12 Closing price of NMC common stock........... $ 16.12 $ 18.61 $ 23.60 $ 19.11 $ 19.11 2000 Three Months Ended Year Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, December 31, Sales................... $ 453.2 $ 411.1 $ 419.4 $ 525.8 $1,809.5 Gross profit(/1/)....... $ 105.8 $ 87.3 $ 74.4 $ 117.0 $ 384.5 Net income (loss) before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle applicable to common shares(/3/)(/4/)....... $ 6.1 $ (25.9) $(36.5) $ (33.5) $ (89.8) Net loss applicable to common shares.......... $ (6.5) $ (25.8) $ (36.5) $ (33.5) $ (102.3) Net income (loss) before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle per common share, basic and diluted................ $ 0.03 $ (0.13) $ (0.19) $ (0.18) $ (0.47) Net loss per common share, basic and Diluted ............... $ (0.03) $ (0.13) $ (0.19) $ (0.18) $ (0.53) Basic weighted average shares outstanding..... 191.9 192.0 192.2 192.8 192.2 Dividends declared per NMC common share....... $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.12 Closing price of NMC common stock........... $ 22.44 $ 21.63 $ 17.00 $ 17.06 $ 17.06 (1) Sales less costs applicable to sales, and depreciation and depletion.

(3) In the quarter ended December 31, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition, as described in Note 18. The accounting principle was applied retroactively to January 1, 2000, and 2000 quarterly information was restated. (4) Included an after tax charge of $0.4 million, none, $1.4 million and $1.3 million in the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, respectively, for expenses related to the change in accounting principle and an after tax impairment charge of $21.3 million, in the quarter ended December 31. Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 0.9, 1.4, 0.5, (5.2), and 1.9 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges represents income before income taxes and interest expense divided by interest expense. Interest expense includes amortization of capitalized interest and the portion of rent expense representative of interest. Earnings in 2001, 1999 and 1998 were inadequate to cover fixed charges, with deficiencies of $14 million, $51 million and $706 million, respectively. The Company guarantees certain third party debt; however, it has not been and does not expect to be required to pay any amounts associated with such debt. Therefore, related interest on such debt has not been included in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. 86 ITEM 7A.
