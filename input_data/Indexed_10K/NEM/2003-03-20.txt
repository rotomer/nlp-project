ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Results for 2000 and 1999 have been restated to reflect the merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company in January 2001 on a pooling of interests basis. Results do not reflect the February 2002 acquisitions described below. On February 13, 2002, Newmont stockholders approved adoption of an Agreement and Plan of Merger that provided for a restructuring of Newmont to facilitate the February 2002 acquisitions described below and to create a flexible corporate structure. Newmont merged with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary that resulted in Newmont becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of a new holding company. The new holding company, previously a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont, was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation. There is no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Newmont as a result of this restructuring and former stockholders of Newmont became stockholders of the new holding company. Restatements and Accounting Changes As further discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Newmont has determined that certain adjustments are required to restate the Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Overall the adjustments increased the 39 net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001 by $23.4 million, or $0.12 per share, decreased the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $5.2 million, or $0.02 per share, and increased the net loss for the year ended December 31, 1999 by $17.2 million, or $0.09 per share. The adjustments also increased the earnings of the years prior to 1999 by $52.7 million and therefore increased Stockholders equity by $19.7 million and $40.7 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, including Other comprehensive income of $2.4 million during 2001. These adjustments were necessary (i) to account for a prepaid forward sales contract and a forward purchase contract as a single borrowing; (ii) to correct depreciation rates on certain mining assets at the Companys subsidiary, Minera Yanacocha; (iii) to record the impact on the Companys investment in Batu Hijau, accounted for under the equity method, correcting its depreciation and deferred stripping calculations so as to exclude material other than proven and probable reserves; and, (iv) to include depreciation, depletion and amortization as a capitalized cost in inventory in Newmont and its equity investment in Batu Hijau. All amounts in the following discussion have been adjusted for these restatements as appropriate. Changes in Accounting Principle Depreciation, depletion and amortization During the third quarter of 2002, Newmont changed its accounting policy, retroactive to January 1, 2002, with respect to depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of Property, Plant and Mine Development to exclude future estimated development costs expected to be incurred for certain underground operations. Previously, the Company had included these costs and associated reserves in its DD&A calculations at certain of its underground mining operations. In addition, the Company further revised its policy such that costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are depreciated, depleted or amortized over the reserves associated with the specific ore area. These changes were made to better match DD&A with the associated ounces of gold sold and to remove the inherent uncertainty in estimating future development costs in arriving at DD&A rates. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle through December 31, 2001 increased net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2002 by $7.7 million, net of tax of $4.1 million and increased net income per share by $0.02 per share. The effect of the change was to reduce DD&A expense by $1.6 million and $2.4 million in the first and second quarters of 2002, respectively, and increase DD&A expense by $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2002. The effect of the change to net income was a decrease of the net loss of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2002, an increase in net income of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2002 and a decrease in net income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2002. The table below presents the pro forma effects of the accounting change on Net loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle had it been in effect for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Years Ended (Increase)/decrease to Net loss (in millions) December 31, 2001 December 31, 2000 December 31, 1999 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization $ 2.0 $ 0.9 $ 1.6 Income tax expense (0.7 ) (0.3 ) (0.5 ) Net loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ 1.3 $ 0.6 $ 1.1 Net loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 40 The table below presents the pro forma Net loss applicable to common shares before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle giving effect to the change discussed above: Years Ended December 31, 2001 December 31, 2000 December 31, 1999 Pro forma net loss applicable to common shares before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ (52.8 ) $ (84.0 ) $ (118.2 ) Pro forma net loss applicable to common shares before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle per share, basic and diluted $ (0.27 ) $ (0.44 ) $ (0.62 ) Summary Newmont recorded a net loss to common shares of $54.1 million ($0.28 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared with net losses of $97.2 million ($0.51 per share) and $119.3 million ($0.62 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Results for 2001 included, after tax, $43.7 million ($0.22 per share) for restructuring and Battle Mountain merger expenses, $57.8 million ($0.30 per share) for asset write downs, $59.3 million ($0.30 per share) for prior period income tax benefits, $3.3 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses and $1.1 million for a gain on written call options. Results in 2000 included after tax noncash charges of $75.9 million ($0.39 per share) for asset write downs, $27.4 million ($0.14 per share) for expenses associated with an acquisition settlement, $23.9 million ($0.12 per share) for losses on marketable securities, $12.6 million ($0.06 per share) for the cumulative effect of accounting changes for revenue recognition, $12.4 million ($0.06 per share) for amortization of put option premiums and $4.0 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses. Also included were after tax charges of $6.9 million ($0.04 per share) for merger expenses and a noncash unrealized mark to market gain on call option contracts of $17.4 million ($0.09 per share). For 1999, results included after tax noncash charges for impairment of an equity investment in Lihir Gold of $46.8 million ($0.24 per share, also net of minority interest), for asset write downs of $59.2 million ($0.31 per share), for an unrealized mark to market loss on call options of $29.1 million ($0.15 per share) and for amortization of put option premiums of $12.0 million ($0.06 per share), partially offset by gains from the sale of exploration properties of $13.6 million ($0.07 per share) and by foreign currency exchange gains of $5.3 million ($0.03 per share). As a largely unhedged company, Newmonts realized gold price of $271, $282, and $284 per equity ounce sold in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, closely tracked the spot market price. At December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, less than 1% of Newmonts proven and probable reserves were subject to derivative contracts. In this environment, Newmonts focus has been to maximize cash flow through cost efficiencies and disciplined capital spending. Newmonts Gold Medal Performance program, a company wide employee driven effort to systematically reduce costs and improve productivity and cash flow by implementing best practices, has driven this focus over the past two years and was extended to each Battle Mountain operation. In 2001, gold sales were 5.47 million equity ounces (or ounces attributable to Newmonts ownership or economic interest), compared to 5.76 million and 4.95 million equity ounces in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total cash costs of production were $184 per ounce in 2001, $170 per ounce in 2000 and $173 per ounce in 1999. As a result of lower production and average realized prices, cash flow from operations declined to $369.7 million in 2001 from $534.3 million in 2000. Long term debt, net of cash balances, was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Gold reserves at December 31, 2001 totaled 59.6 million contained equity ounces compared with 66.3 million ounces at December 31, 2000. Reserve calculations for 2001 and 2000 were based on a long term 41 price assumption of $300 per ounce. A gold price of $275 per ounce could lower reserves approximately 7%, while a $325 per ounce price could increase reserves approximately 5%. In 2001, copper sales totaled 360 million equity pounds (or pounds attributable to Newmonts ownership or economic interest), compared with 294 million equity pounds in 2000. Total cash costs were $0.37 and $0.59 per equity pound, after gold sales credits, for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average realized price in 2001 was $0.70 per pound, compared with $0.82 per pound in 2000. Proven and probable reserves totaled 6.0 billion contained equity pounds of copper at December 31, 2001. Mergers and Acquisitions Normandy Mining Limited and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited In November 2001, Newmont announced proposed acquisitions of Normandy Mining Limited, an Australian company, and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited, a Canadian company. On February 16, 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Franco Nevada pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement. On February 20, 2002, Newmont gained control of Normandy through a tender offer for all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Normandy. On February 26, 2002, when Newmonts tender offer for Normandy expired, Newmont had a relevant interest in more than 96% of Normandys outstanding shares. Newmont is exercising compulsory acquisition rights under Australian law to acquire all of the remaining shares of Normandy. This process was completed in April 2002. The consideration for Normandy included 3.85 shares of Newmont common stock for every 100 shares of Normandy (including ordinary shares represented by American depositary receipts) plus A$0.50 per Normandy share, or the U.S. dollar equivalent of that amount for stockholders outside Australia, net to the seller in cash. Pursuant to a Canadian Plan of Arrangement, Franco Nevada was acquired in a stock for stock transaction in which Franco Nevada common stockholders received 0.80 shares of Newmont common stock or 0.80 of an exchangeable share, exchangeable for Newmont common stock, for each common share of Franco Nevada held. Newmont issued approximately 197.4 million shares (or share equivalents) in conjunction with these acquisitions, which, including the cash compensation paid, reflect a fair value of approximately $4.3 billion. Normandy is Australias largest gold producer, with over 2 million ounces of gold production annually, and with operations in Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Turkey, Chile, Brazil and Canada. Normandy is also a producer of zinc concentrates and owns interests in companies producing cobalt and magnesium. Franco Nevada has a portfolio of royalty interests covering producing and non producing mineral properties located in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia and various South American countries. Franco Nevada also has a portfolio of oil and gas interests in western Canada and various direct and indirect interests through investments in resource properties in Canada, Nevada, Central and South America, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia and the Dominican Republic. The acquisitions are being accounted for using the purchase method whereby assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair market value as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over such fair value will be recorded as goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will be assigned to assets acquired and will not be amortized. Goodwill is subject to a determination of fair value at least annually and at such times as events or circumstances indicate impairment has occurred. Newmont expects to incur at least an estimated $90 million of incremental direct costs associated with the acquisitions, which will be capitalized. As of December 31, 2001, Newmont had spent approximately $4.1 million of such acquisition costs. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisitions, it is expected that approximately $70 million of after tax synergies will be realized in the first full year of operations, increasing to approximately $90 million by the end of the second full year. Such synergies will be obtained from the rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration and development budgets as well as operating efficiencies and costs reductions associated with procurement, interest and tax benefits. 42 Battle Mountain Gold Company On January 10, 2001, Newmont completed a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated June 21, 2000, under which each share of common stock of Battle Mountain and each exchangeable share of Battle Mountain Canada Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Battle Mountain) was converted into the right to receive 0.105 share of Newmont, or approximately 24.1 million shares. Newmont also exchanged 2.3 million shares of newly issued $3.25 convertible preferred stock for all outstanding shares of Battle Mountain $3.25 convertible preferred stock. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and as such, the Consolidated Financial Statements include Battle Mountains financial data as if Battle Mountain had always been part of Newmont. During 2001, Newmont successfully integrated the former Battle Mountain operations in Canada and Bolivia, the Phoenix development project in Nevada, and its interest in the Pajingo joint venture operation in Australia. Synergies in excess of the estimated $25 million, pre tax, were achieved during 2001 from consolidation of administrative and exploration staffs, purchasing economies and application of Gold Medal Performance. The Phoenix project will provide an opportunity for additional synergies in future years from utilization of existing nearby processing facilities. Market Conditions and Risks Metal Price Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment and production levels. Based on estimates of Newmont stand alone 2002 production and expenses, a $10 per ounce change in the gold price would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $71 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $42 million (about $0.21 per share) in net income. Changes in the market price of copper also affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow from its equity investment in Batu Hijau. Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. Based on estimates of Newmont stand alone 2002 production and expenses, a $0.10 per pound change in the copper price would result in an increase or decrease in net income of approximately $13 million (about $0.07 per share). Newmont has generally sold its gold production at market prices; however, it had forward sales contracts (1) from its Golden Giant operations for 31,000 ounces in 2001 at an average price of $314 per ounce and 34,000 ounces in 2000 at an average price of $316 per ounce, and (2) for 125,000 ounces in each of 2000 and 1999 from its Minahasa mine in Indonesia at an average price of $454 per ounce. In December 2001, Newmont entered into offsetting positions to effectively close out the combination matched put and call options and the flat forward sales contracts at its Golden Giant operations. Following a decline in spot market prices to $253 per ounce in July 1999, Newmont entered into two put and call option contracts to provide a measure of price protection, as described in Note 10. The call options, covering 2.35 million ounces, were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under the terms of the contracts, Newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $350 per ounce in 2005 to $392 per ounce in 2011. The value of the sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. Newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to its commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. Credit risk is minimized by contracting only with major financial institutions/counterparties. 43 At December 31, 2001, the following offsetting commodity instruments were outstanding: Ounces Fair Value (in millions) Combination, matched put and call options, expiring 2002 2004 193,067 $ 3.2 Offsetting combination, matched put and call options, expiring 2002 2004 193,067 (3.2 ) Flat forward sales contracts, 2002 2004 64,067 2.0 Forward purchase contracts, 2002 2004 64,067 (2.0 ) At December 31, 2001 the Normandy hedge position consisted of derivative contracts covering approximately 8.6 million ounces of gold at an average price of $283 per ounce. At that time, the Normandy hedge position included forward sales, purchased put and convertible put contracts covering 5.8, 1.3 and 1.5 million ounces at net contract prices of $286, $267 and $283, respectively. At December 31, 2001, the mark to market value of the combined Normandy hedge position (which includes subsidiaries) represented an approximate liability of $239 million. All prices and values noted above were converted to US dollars at the December 31, 2001, closing exchange rate of A$1.9543/US$1.00. Foreign Currency In addition to the U.S., Newmont operates in Canada, Peru, Bolivia, Uzbekistan and Indonesia and has interests in joint ventures in Australia and Mexico. Gold produced at these operations is sold in the international markets for U.S. dollars. The cost and debt structures at these operations are primarily U.S. dollar denominated, except for the Canadian and Australian operations where such structures are primarily denominated in local currencies. To the extent there are fluctuations in local currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, the devaluation of a local currency is generally economically neutral or beneficial to the operation because local salaries and supply contracts will decrease against the U.S. dollar revenue stream. Foreign currency exchange rate losses primarily related to Canadian and Australian operations were $5.1 million and $6.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and gains were $8.2 million in 1999. Interest Rates At December 31, 2001, Newmonts long term debt of $1,426.9 million included $334.6 million of variable rate debt (which included $200 million of principal tied to fixed for floating interest rate swaps) with an average interest rate of 6.7%, fixed rate debt of $947.3 million, with an average interest rate of 7.6% and an estimated fair value of $954.3 million, and $145.0 million with respect to the prepaid forward sale obligation (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), with an estimated fair value of $171.6 million. Newmonts public debt has investment grade credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service (Baa3) and Standard & Poors Ratings Services (BBB). During the last half of 2001, Newmont entered into contracts to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its $275 million 8 5/8% notes and its $200 million 8 3/8% debentures. Newmont receives fixed rate interest payments at 8 5/8% or 8 3/8% and pays floating rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 4.25%. The notional principal amount of these transactions (representing the amount of principal tied to floating interest rate exposure) was $200 million at December 31, 2001. Half of these contracts expire in July 2005 and half expire in May 2011. At December 31, 2001, these transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $0.8 million. These transactions have been designated as fair value hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $0.6 million. Fuel Hedges Newmont uses certain derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its exposure to fuel price market fluctuations, from time to time. At December 31, 2001, Newmont had contracts expiring September 2002 covering approximately 8.6 million gallons of diesel fuel at its Nevada operations at prices ranging from approximately $0.61 to $0.69 per gallon. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $1.3 million. 44 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of Newmonts Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most critical accounting principles upon which Newmonts financial status depends are those requiring estimates of proven and probable reserves, recoverable ounces therefrom, and or assumptions of future gold prices. Such estimates and assumptions affect the value of inventories (which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value), the potential impairment of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. These estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which depreciation, depletion and amortization are charged to earnings. As noted above, commodity prices significantly affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow. In addition, management estimates costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as remediation costs for inactive properties as described below. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions. Results of Operations Equity Ozs.

See Note 23. For all periods presented, total cash costs include charges for mining ore and waste associated with current period gold production, processing ore through milling and leaching facilities, by product credits, production taxes, royalties and other cash costs. Certain gold mines produce silver as a by product. Proceeds from the sale of by products are reflected as credits to total cash costs. All of these charges and by product credits are included in Costs applicable to sales. Charges for reclamation are also included in Costs applicable to sales, but are not included in total cash costs. Reclamation charges are included in total production costs, together with total cash costs and Depreciation, depletion and amortization. A reconciliation of total cash costs to Costs applicable to sales in total and by segment is provided in Item 2, Properties, Operating Statistics on page 26. Total production costs provide an indication of earnings before interest expense and taxes for Newmonts share of gold mining properties, when taking into account the average realized price received for gold sold, as this measure combines Costs applicable to sales plus Depreciation, depletion and amortization, net of minority interest. This measure is intended to provide investors with information about cash generating capacities of these mining operations. Newmonts management uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its gold mining operations. This information differs from earnings determined in accordance with 45 GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. This measure was developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmonts measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. North American Operations Newmonts Nevada operations (along the Carlin Trend near Elko and in the Winnemucca region, where Twin Creeks and the Lone Tree Complex are located) include production from nine open pit and four underground mines. Oxide ores are processed by milling or heap leaching, depending upon ore grade. The Carlin roaster and Winnemucca region autoclaves process higher grade refractory ores. The Lone Tree flotation plant processes lower grade refractory ores. A developed linear program is utilized to determine the best mix of ores for each processing plant to maximize recoveries and economic returns. Nevadas sales of 2.7 million ounces in 2001 were 11% lower than in 2000, with the depletion of the Deep Post surface deposit early in 2001 resulting in approximately 300,000 less high grade, low cost open pit ounces produced during 2001 than during 2000. This also caused total cash costs to increase to $222 per ounce in 2001. Approximately 139 million tons of material were mined from surface open pits in 2001, down 31% and 37% from 2000 and 1999, respectively. Refractory ore treatment facilities, with higher processing costs than oxide ore mills, generated 65% of Nevadas production in 2001, as compared to 68% and 54% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Production and total cash costs in 2002 are expected to remain consistent with 2001 levels. Production from the Deep Post underground mine commenced in the first quarter of 2001 and approximately $10 million has been allocated for capital equipment and mine development during 2002. By 2003, Deep Post is expected to reach an annual production rate of approximately 380,000 ounces at an estimated average total cash cost of approximately $150 per ounce over the life of the mine. While permitting and metallurgical work will continue on the Phoenix project, minimal capital will be allocated for mine construction during 2002 under the current market gold price environment. Gold sales at the Mesquite heap leach mine in southern California decreased 29% to 92,600 ounces in 2001. Total cash costs per ounce also decreased 7% to $205 per ounce. Mining activities ceased in the second quarter of 2001 with the depletion of the ore body. Final gold production from continued declining recovery of gold from heap leach pads is expected in 2003. Selected equipment from the Mesquite mine has been transferred to operations in South America and in Nevada. At La Herradura, a 44% owned, nonoperated heap leach operation in Sonora, Mexico, Newmonts equity share of 2001 sales totaled 54,700 ounces at a total cash cost of $173 per ounce. Production in 2002 is expected at approximately 65,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $178 per ounce. Production sold from the Golden Giant underground mine in Ontario, Canada was 284,000 ounces at a total cash cost of $187 per ounce compared with 407,000 ounces at $146 per ounce and 356,000 ounces at $144 per ounce in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The maturing mine has experienced lower average ore grades over the past three years and in 2002, production is expected to be approximately 280,000 ounces at $166 per ounce. The Holloway underground mine in Ontario, Canada is an 84.65% owned joint venture with Teddy Bear Valley Mines. In 2001, sales totaled 89,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $209 per ounce and in 2002 are expected to increase to approximately 100,000 equity ounces at $196 per ounce. Overseas Operations Minera Yanacocha in Peru is 51.35% owned and includes five open pit mines, four leach pads, two gold recovery plants and a crushing agglomeration facility. In 2001, Yanacocha achieved record sales of 1.91 million ounces (983,000 equity ounces), a 9% increase from 2000 and 16% more than in 1999. Total cash costs of $115 per ounce are comparatively low because of low waste to ore ratios and porous ore that yields high gold recoveries without crushing prior to heap leaching for most ore types. 46 Production at Yanacocha has grown annually through the discovery and development of reserves and increased mining and processing capacity. During 2001, approximately 156 million tons of material were mined (85 million ore tons and 71 million waste tons), an 18% increase from 2000 and 47% more than in 1999. In late 1999, Yanacocha terminated its contract mining agreement and improved productivity and efficiency by conducting mine operations with its own employees. Yanacochas first crushing and agglomeration facility, for the La Quinua deposit, started up late in the third quarter of 2001 and will continue to undergo commissioning adjustments through the first half of 2002, gradually stepping up to its design rate of 132,000 tons per day (120,000 metric tons per day) by the end of June. Production in 2001 was slightly lower than targeted due to slower leach cycle recoveries for gold and short term bottlenecks in mining fleet utilization and availability during the commissioning of the new crushing facility. In 2002, production is expected to exceed 2.3 million ounces (1.2 million equity ounces) with a full year of production from the La Quinua mine. Total cash costs at Yanacocha are expected to increase to approximately $125 per ounce as the processing of La Quinua ore, which requires crushing and agglomeration before heap leaching, will impact overall costs. By 2003, production from La Quinua is expected to reach over one million ounces annually at a total cash cost of approximately $129 per ounce over the life of the deposit. The Kori Kollo open pit mine in Bolivia is held by Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., in which Newmont has an 88% interest and Zeland Mines, S.A. has a 12% interest. Production sold in 2001 was 275,000 equity ounces, up from 248,000 and 256,000 equity ounces in 2000 and 1999, respectively, reflecting ore placements on the new heap leach pad that commenced operation in the third quarter of 2001. Total cash costs decreased to $158 per ounce, a result of increased production. For 2002, production is expected at approximately 264,000 equity ounces with cash costs of $146 per ounce. The Zarafshan Newmont Joint Venture, in the Central Asian Republic of Uzbekistan, is a 50/50 joint venture between Newmont and two Uzbekistan government entities. Zarafshan Newmont produces gold by crushing and heap leaching low grade oxide ore from existing stockpiles at the government owned Muruntau mine. Gold sales in 2001 totaled 444,000 ounces (222,000 equity ounces) compared with 502,800 ounces (251,400 equity ounces) in 2000 and 542,900 ounces (271,500 equity ounces) in 1999. Total cash costs increased to $136 per ounce from $129 per ounce in 2000 and decreased from $161 per ounce in 1999. The leach pad expansion construction is underway and is scheduled for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Production in 2002 is expected to be consistent with 2001 at approximately 450,000 ounces (225,000 equity ounces), with total cash costs increasing to approximately $169 per ounce primarily from lower foreign exchange gains and higher utility and supply costs associated with the operation of the expanded leach pad. Zarafshan Newmont produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low grade oxide ore from the nearby government owned Murantau mine. The State Committee and Navoi furnish the ore to Zarafshan Newmont under an ore supply agreement. In late 2000, the ore supply agreement was amended to modify the required grades and pricing structure of the ore supply agreement covering 220 million metric tons of ore. At signing of the amendment, 68.8 million metric tons had already been delivered. Of the remaining 151.2 million metric tons, 48.7 million metric tons are to be delivered regardless of the gold price, with the price of the ore being dependent on the grade of ore delivered. For the remaining ore (102.5 million metric tons) the grade of ore that the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to provide is dependent on the forecasted gold price as determined by the board of directors of Zarafshan Newmont, and the price is dependent on the average gold price during the period the ore is processed. Thus, at higher gold prices, the State Committee and Navoi may deliver lower grade ore, but receive a higher price. At Minahasa, in Indonesia, Newmont has an 80% interest but receives a greater percent of the gold production until recouping the bulk of its investment including interest. Prior to November 2001, Newmont received 100% of Minahasas gold production and subsequently received 94%, as Newmont recouped some of its investment through the collection of funds in accordance with existing loan agreements. Production decreased to 341,500 equity ounces with total cash costs of $142 per ounce, 7% higher than 2000, primarily from lower grade 47 ore. Mining activities ceased late in 2001; however, it is expected that processing will continue until 2003. Production in 2002 is expected at approximately 120,000 equity ounces, with total cash costs of approximately $236 per ounce. At Pajingo (Vera/Nancy), a 50% owned joint venture with Normandy, the operator of the underground mine in Queensland, Australia, Newmonts equity share of 2001 sales totaled 126,000 ounces at a total cash cost of $105 per ounce. Increased sales from 2000 and 1999 resulted from production increases from the completion of a mill expansion project in 1999. Total production in 2002 is expected at approximately 290,000 ounces with cash costs of $82 per ounce. The Batu Hijau copper/gold mine in Indonesia completed its first full year of production in 2000 following start up in the fourth quarter of 1999. Newmont holds an indirect 45% equity interest in the mine, but receives 56.25% of production until recouping the bulk of its investment. Copper sales totaled 360.0 million, 294.2 million and 10.2 million equity pounds (or pounds attributable to Newmonts ownership or economic interest) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total cash costs were $0.37, $0.59, and $0.84 per pound, after gold by product credits, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Gold and silver sales, treated as by product credits, totaled 295,100, 178,400 and 6,300 ounces of gold and minor amounts of silver for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. The Companys equity income from Batu Hijau includes gold and silver revenues that are credited against costs applicable to sales as by product credits in the determination of net income for each period presented in the Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). These by product credits represented 42%, 27% and 29% of revenues and reduced production costs by 48%, 28% and 20% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Such by product credits are expected to continue while ore is being processed which, based on current engineering models, is estimated to be through the end of 2020. These by product credits are expected to vary from time to time and are significant to the economics of the Batu Hijau operation. At current copper prices, the Batu Hijau operation would not be profitable without these credits. Production in 2002 is expected at between 550 million to 600 million pounds of copper (310 million to 340 million equity pounds) and between 360,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold (200,000 to 225,000 equity ounces). Total cash costs are expected to be approximately $0.43 per pound, after gold sales credits. Financial Results Consolidated sales include 100% of Yanacocha and Kori Kollo production and Newmonts ownership share of production elsewhere, except for Batu Hijau, which is accounted for as an equity investment. Variances in sales revenue are illustrated in the following table: Years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Consolidated sales (in millions)(1) $ 1,666.1 $ 1,819.0 $ 1,627.1 Consolidated production ozs. sold (in thousands)(1) 6,141.8 6,472.9 5,780.3 Average price received per ounce(1) $ 271 $ 282 $ 284 Average market price received per ounce $ 271 $ 279 $ 280 2001 vs 2000 2000 vs 1999 Increase (decrease) in consolidated sales due to (in millions): Consolidated production(1) $ (92.3 ) $ 191.2 Average gold price received(1) (60.6 ) 0.7 Total $ (152.9 ) $ 191.9 (1) As restated. See Note 23. 48 Dividends, interest and other for 2001 included interest income of $3.0 million, down from $10.5 million and $15.4 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, reflecting lower interest rates during the year. Also included were foreign currency exchange losses of $5.1 million and $6.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and foreign currency exchange gains of $8.2 million in 1999. Sales of exploration properties generated gains of $3.7 million, $1.6 million and $20.6 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Costs applicable to sales include total cash costs and provisions for estimated final reclamation expenses related to consolidated production. The increase in costs primarily related to higher operating costs at Yanacocha from higher tonnage moved and greater processing and administration costs, partially offset by cost reduction efforts at all locations. Years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Costs applicable to sales: North American operations: Nevada operations $ 610.9 $ 625.6 $ 534.1 Mesquite 20.4 29.4 27.5 La Herradura 9.6 6.8 6.4 Golden Giant 54.8 61.8 55.3 Holloway 19.1 19.4 19.6 South American operations: Yanacocha(1) 233.9 165.4 184.6 Kori Kollo 50.8 67.1 68.1 Zarafshan Newmont 30.4 32.8 44.1 Minahasa 49.7 47.6 36.1 Pajingo 13.4 11.6 8.4 Other (0.2 ) (1.6 ) (2.1 ) Total $ 1,092.8 $ 1,065.9 $ 982.1 (1) As restated. See Note 23. Deferred Stripping In general, mining costs are charged to Costs applicable to sales as incurred. However, at open pit mines, which have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios over the mine life, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units of production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios; however industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Companys operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold with an equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there may be greater volatility in the Companys period to period results of operations. 49 Details of deferred stripping with respect to certain of the Companys open pit mines are as follows (unaudited): Nevada(3) Mesquite(4) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 138.4 145.1 161.4 237.6 120.7 190.7 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.066 0.066 0.063 0.023 0.018 0.020 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 88.9 106.6 162.2 155.5 180.4 134.2 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.060 0.060 0.057 0.031 0.016 0.017 Remaining Mine Life (years) 9 10 11 1 2 Minahasa(5) La Herradura(6) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 14.5 19.8 24.0 177.0 144.4 172.6 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.172 0.195 0.158 0.035 0.032 0.034 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 15.9 16.4 22.4 200.0 228.4 201.7 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.131 0.205 0.326 0.025 0.024 0.023 Remaining Mine Life (years) 1 2 6 7 8 (1) Total tons to be mined in future divided by total ounces of gold to be recovered in future, based on proven and probable reserves. (2) Total tons mined divided by total ounces of gold recovered. (3) The life of mine stripping ratio decreased during 2000 and 2001 from 1999 reflecting the deferral of open pit projects in response to lower gold prices. The actual stripping ratio during 2000 and 2001 decreased from 1999 due to mining activities in the Twin Creeks pit entering into higher grade ore zones. (4) The life of mine stripping ratio decreased in 2000 from 1999 and increased in 2001 versus 2000 reflecting significant changes to the mine plan in the final three years of operations. The actual stripping ratio was higher during 2000 in comparison to 1999 as a result of because of clearing additional waste material to access an ore zone. (5) The actual and life of mine stripping ratios decreased during 2000 and 2001 from 1999 reflecting higher grade ore zones at the bottom of the Mesel pit as mining concluded in the fourth quarter of 2001. (6) The increase in the life of mine stripping ratio in 2001 versus 2000 is due to an increase in proven and probable reserves, which resulted in a change in the pit design. 50 Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased in 2001 primarily as a result of decreased gold production at Nevada, partially offset by the impact of 2000 capital expenditures at Yanacocha. The increase in 2000 primarily resulted from increased gold production in Nevada and Yanacocha. Years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In millions, as restated) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: North American operations: Nevada operations $ 117.4 $ 126.4 $ 132.9 Mesquite 7.5 9.1 7.5 La Herradura 3.2 2.6 2.0 Golden Giant 18.3 25.8 22.9 Holloway 6.5 10.6 12.0 South American operations: Yanacocha 82.3 68.8 56.2 Kori Kollo 19.5 23.9 25.6 Zarafshan Newmont 11.9 14.0 15.0 Minahasa 22.8 26.7 19.0 Pajingo 4.3 4.3 2.8 Other 7.9 8.5 6.2 Total $ 301.6 $ 320.7 $ 302.1 Exploration and research expenses in 2001 were $55.5 million, compared with $77.4 million in 2000 and $74.2 million in 1999. The decrease in 2001 reflected planned reductions as a result of lower gold prices than in previous years and the increased focus on exploration activities at or around existing operations. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $98.1 million, $106.1 million and $83.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net interest expense in 2001 decreased because of lower average interest rates and higher capitalized interest for Yanacocha. Expenses for acquisition settlement of $42.2 million in 2000 related to the resolution of a dispute regarding Newmonts purchase of an additional 13.35% interest in Minera Yanacocha as described in Note 16. Write down of assets in 2001 of $57.8 million pre tax consisted of a reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets, and inventory reductions and were primarily related to Minahasa ($18.9 million), Nevada ($22.6 million), Kori Kollo ($4.8 million), Yanacocha ($4.1 million), the San Luis property in Colorado ($3.5 million) and other properties ($3.9 million). As described in Note 17, the write down of long lived assets represents the excess carrying value of assets compared to fair value, with fair value determined using discounted future cash flow analyses. Such cash flows are based on estimated recoverable ounces, future production and capital costs, and gold price assumptions. Gold price assumptions were $285 per ounce in 2002 and $300 per ounce thereafter. The Minahasa write down reduced fixed assets by $12.1 million, increased reclamation liabilities by $3.7 million, and reduced ore stockpile and materials and supply inventories by $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Nevada write down reduced ore and in process inventory by $7.3 million and fixed assets by $4.4 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced fixed assets by $4.8 million. The San Luis write down reduced fixed assets by $2.0 million and materials and supply inventory by $1.5 million. The write downs had no impact on the scope of these operations and will reduce future pre tax Costs applicable to sales by $16.9 million and Depreciation, depletion and amortization by $40.9 million based on remaining production as of December 31, 2001, with no impact on future cash flows. The restatement adjustments to capitalize DD&A in inventory (see Note 23) included write downs of inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value of $16.8 million in 2001. Of this amount, $5.7 million and $5.2 million related to write downs of stockpile and mill in process inventories, respectively, at the Nevada operations, $4.1 million related to write downs of heap leach inventories at Minera Yanacocha and $1.8 million related to inventory write downs at other operations. 51 In 2000, the write down of assets was $75.9 million pre tax and related to Holloway ($30.8 million), Mesquite ($14.8 million), Nevada operations ($13.5 million), Kori Kollo ($5.6 million), the Mezcala property in Mexico ($6.5 million) the Minahasa mine in Indonesia ($3.1 million), to inventory at the Battle Mountain Complex ($0.7 million) and other properties ($0.9 million). For 2000, gold price assumptions were $285 per ounce in 2001 and $300 per ounce thereafter. The Holloway write down reduced fixed assets by $30.8 million. The Mesquite write down reduced leach pad inventory by $9.7 million, deferred stripping by $1.4 million and fixed assets by $3.7 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced inventory by $4.9 million and fixed assets by $0.7 million. The write downs reduced future pre tax Costs applicable to sales by $16.0 million and Depreciation, depletion and amortization by $52.7 million. The acquisition cost of the Mezcala property was written off as no future cash flows from the property were anticipated as of December 31, 2000. The restatement adjustments to capitalize DD&A in inventory (see Note 23) included write downs of inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value of $17.5 million in 2000. Of this amount, $9.6 million and $3.9 million related to write downs of stockpile and mill in process inventories, respectively, at the Nevada operations, $3.1 million to write downs of finished goods inventories at the Minahasa operations and $0.9 million to inventory write downs at other operations. In 1999, Battle Mountains Crown Jewel project in Washington was written off ($35.9 million), Nevada stockpile inventories were written down ($22.7 million) and other operations ($0.6 million). The Crown Jewel write down related to mine development costs and the remaining carrying value as a result of permitting uncertainties arising from a January 2000 decision from the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board that reversed its water rights permits and vacated its Clean Water Act certification. In 2001, Newmont disposed of its interest in the Crown Jewel property, but retained a royalty on future production. The restatement adjustments to capitalize DD&A in inventory (see Note 23) included write downs of inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value of $19.7 million in 1999. Of this amount, $19.2 million related to write downs of stockpile inventories at the Nevada operations and $0.5 million to write downs at other operations. Merger and restructuring expenses of $60.5 million in 2001 included $28.1 million of transaction and related costs associated with the Battle Mountain merger and $32.4 million of restructuring expenses that included $22.1 million for voluntary early retirement pension benefits and $10.3 million for employee severance and office closures. Other expenses in 2001, 2000 and 1999 included $1.0 million, $12.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively, for environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. The year 2000 also included $13.2 million to increase the remediation liability for San Luis, Colorado and $10.0 million for costs associated with a mercury spill at Yanacocha, both described below. In 1999, $9.5 million was included for San Luis and $5.4 million for costs associated with terminating the contract mining agreement at Yanacocha. Gain (loss) on written call options reflected the change in fair value of the contracts at the end of each year. In September 2001, Newmont entered into transactions that closed out the call options. These options were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. The call options were marked to the market value of $53.8 million immediately prior to close, resulting in a noncash gain of $1.8 million in 2001. The value of the new sales contracts was recorded as Deferred revenue from sale of future production and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. In 2000, the noncash gain on the written call options was $26.8 million and in 1999 there was a noncash loss of $44.8 million. Loss on marketable securities of Lihir reflected a noncash write down of $23.9 million as of December 31, 2000, resulting from an other than temporary decline in market value based on the length of time and the extent to which such value had been less than cost basis. During 2001, the valuation of the marketable securities of Lihir significantly increased, resulting in an $18.3 million gain charged to Other comprehensive income (loss). As described in Note 1, Lihir Gold operates a gold mine in Papua New Guinea and prior to 2000 the investment was accounted for on an equity basis. 52 Income tax benefit of $59.3 million in 2001 included benefits of tax depletion, utilization of tax loss carry forwards, utilization of foreign tax credits and resolution of tax issues provided for prior to 2001. In 2000, income tax expense was $5.6 million which includes a benefit from tax depletion and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities associated with undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. In 1999, income tax expense was $12.9 million with an effective rate of 36%. Equity income (loss) and impairment of affiliates included income of $22.5 million from Batu Hijau in 2001, and losses of $17.7 million and $8.9 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, reflecting the ramp up in production that commenced in the fourth quarter of 1999. Also included in 1999 were impairments for the equity investment in Lihir Gold of $76.2 million. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in 2001 included an $18.3 million gain for temporary changes in the market value of Lihir Gold securities, $3.2 million for losses associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, 1.7 million gain for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method for derivative instruments, $0.9 million loss for the effective portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedge instruments and a $0.4 million gain on minimum pension liability adjustment. For 2000, other comprehensive loss, net of tax, included a loss of $1.8 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and a $1.3 million gain for minimum pension liability adjustment. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Nos. 141 and 142, Business Combinations and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, respectively. The adoption of these standards on January 1, 2002 did not impact Newmonts historical Consolidated Financial Statements or results of operations. As previously noted, the 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada are being accounted for as purchases and a significant portion of the $4.3 billion purchase price will represent goodwill, resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Such goodwill will not be amortized, but will be subject to impairment testing at least annually, as prescribed by SFAS No. 144. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, that established uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement will be adopted January 1, 2003, when Newmont will record the estimated present value of reclamation liabilities and increase the carrying amount of the related asset. Subsequently, reclamation costs will be allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. Newmont is in the process of quantifying the effect of adoption on January 1, 2003. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121 (Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of), for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and there was no impact upon adoption. In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS 145 nullified SFAS 4, SFAS 44 and SFAS 64 and established that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of APB Opinion No. 30 Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. SFAS 145 also amends SFAS Statement No. 13 Accounting for Leases to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback 53 transactions and makes technical corrections to various other FASB statements. For the provisions of SFAS 145 relating to the extinguishment of debt, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions relating to SFAS 13 are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002, and all other provisions are effective for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002. We do not anticipate any impact upon adoption. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities which addressed financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. It nullified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan as was required under EITF No. 94 3. SFAS 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, and we do not anticipate any impact upon adoption except with respect to those exit or disposal activities that are initiated by the Company after that date. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure to provide alternative methods for voluntary transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. SFAS 148 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002 and we do not anticipate any impact in the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements 5, 57, 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 requires recognition and measurement of guarantees entered into or modified beginning on January 1, 2003 and requires expanded disclosure of guarantees as of December 31, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 45 on its financial position and results of operations upon adoption. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which provides guidance on the identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46 impacts accounting for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and requires expanded disclosure of variable interest entities for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on its financial position and results of operations upon adoption. Effective January 1, 2000, Newmont changed its method of accounting, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, to recognize revenue when third party refined gold is delivered to the customer rather than upon the completion of the production process, or when gold was poured into dor at the mine. As discussed in Note 19, the cumulative effect of the accounting change was a $12.6 million charge to net income, net of tax and minority interest, and included $3.9 million for the Canadian operations, $3.2 million for Minahasa, $2.2 million for Yanacocha, $1.6 million for Zarafshan Newmont, $1.4 million for Nevada, $0.2 million for Kori Kollo and $0.1 million for Pajingo (Vera/Nancy). Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to recognize derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value. As a result, the Company increased Other comprehensive income by $1.7 million, net of tax, for the cumulative effect of the accounting change. 54 Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year 2001, cash flow from operating activities of $369.7 million, restricted cash of $40.0 million and net debt borrowings of $70.0 million funded capital expenditures of $390.0 million and dividends of $31.0 million. On a stand alone basis, Newmont expects to generate approximately 35% to 40% more cash from operations in 2002 at current gold prices. Following the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions, Newmont expects to have increased financial liquidity at current gold prices with an estimated net debt to total capitalization ratio of 24% and to fund capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Investing Activities Batu Hijau As discussed above and in Note 6, Newmont has an indirect 45% interest in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and its partner, an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation, has an indirect 35% interest. Because Newmont and Sumitomo carried the interest of the 20% Indonesian partner, Newmont recognizes 56.25% of Batu Hijaus income until recouping the bulk of its investment. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Newmonts investment in Batu Hijau was $543.3 million and $521.6 million, respectively. Newmont and Sumitomo have a contingent obligation to provide a $125 million support facility on a pro rata basis, if required. During 2001, Newmont advanced approximately $9.0 million to Batu Hijau under the contingent support facility and received $8.4 million in principal repayments associated with an existing shareholder loan. Newmont and Sumitomo will be required to provide additional funds under the contingent support facility during 2002. The amount of this contingent support will depend upon copper and gold prices, necessary capital expenditures at Batu Hijau, and required principal and interest payments. The $1.0 billion project financing facility entered into in July 1997 (Senior Debt) was fully utilized as of December 31, 2000, and the balance outstanding at December 31, 2001 was $913 million. This loan became non recourse to Newmont when project completion tests were met in October 2000. Semi annual debt repayments of $43.5 million commenced in May 2001. Australian Magnesium Corporation Newmont has a 22.8% voting interest in Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC), which raised equity to support the development of a project involving a proprietary chemical and dehydration process for producing anhydrous magnesium chloride as feed for an electrolytic cell to produce molten magnesium metal and magnesium alloys. Newmont has an obligation to contribute to AMC A$100 million (approximately $51 million) in equity by January 31, 2003, which was satisfied in the first quarter of 2003. See additional discussion below. In addition, Newmont provided an A$90 million (approximately $46 million) contingency equity commitment in the event the project does not achieve certain specified production and operating criteria by December 2006, which commitment is being renegotiated so as to require that Newmont provide for an A$75 million convertible debt and equity facility. Newmont has also guaranteed a $30 million obligation payable by AMC to Ford Motor Company in the event the project does not meet certain specified production and operating criteria by November 2005. Newmont expects to meet any funding obligations from operating cash flow. Newmont is guarantor of the $A71 million (approximately $36 million) corporate facility of AMCs subsidiary, QMC Finance Pty Limited (QMC). QMC is a party to a series of foreign exchange contracts. All obligations related to these contracts have been guaranteed by Newmont Australia and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries. These contracts are designed to convert the receipt of Euro dollars and US$ revenue from the sale of magnesium into A$ cash flows to cover A$ operating costs and the servicing of A$ denominated debt. The contracts include foreign exchange forward contracts and bought put options. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of the contracts was a negative US$10.4 million. On January 3, 2003 Newmont contributed an additional A$100 million ($US 55.9 million) to AMC pursuant to its obligation under the original investment in return for approximately 167 million additional shares, 55 increasing our ownership percentage to 40.9%. However, due to the conversion by a third party shareholder of preferred shares to voting common shares, our interest was decreased to 27.8%. In addition, subsequent to year end the A$90 million (approximately $49 million) contingent equity commitment outlined in Note 7 was negotiated into an A$75 million (approximately $41 million) contingent convertible debt and equity facility. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures decreased in 2001 from 2000 primarily from the completion of the development of the Deep Post underground mine in early 2001 and reduced stripping activity in Nevada. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Capital expenditures: North American operations: Nevada operations $ 47.1 $ 65.7 $ 38.8 Mesquite 0.4 0.8 1.2 La Herradura 0.9 3.0 5.0 Golden Giant 7.1 14.9 9.7 Holloway 1.5 5.5 3.9 South American operations: Yanacocha (100%) 276.9 276.9 126.3 Kori Kollo 10.5 7.8 7.0 Zarafshan Newmont 20.4 4.3 3.2 Minahasa 0.5 8.5 Pajingo 7.3 4.9 10.2 Other projects and capitalized interest 17.9 3.1 27.8 Total $ 390.0 $ 387.4 $ 241.6 In 2001, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($15.7 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), mine facilities at Deep Post ($9.9 million), mining equipment ($6.3 million), development of the Phoenix project ($4.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($128.4 million), Yanacocha leach pad operations ($44.9 million), mining equipment ($44.3 million), Carachugo leach pad operations ($19.3 million) and other replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Zarafshan Newmont included $19 million for heap leach pad expansion and associated conveyor support facility. In 2000, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($27.5 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), development of the Phoenix project ($9.8 million), mining equipment ($10.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($144.2 million), unitization of regional properties ($45.7 million), leach pad expansion ($30.8 million), mine development ($30.0 million) and other replacement capital. During 1999, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($15.1 million), development of the Phoenix project ($12.8 million), refractory leach pads ($5.8 million) and other ongoing capital requirements. Yanacocha capital expenditures included costs to convert to owner mining ($58.3 million), leach pad expansion ($41.2 million) and development drilling and mine development ($18.0 million). Capital requirements for 2002 will be determined following completion of the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada. Newmont expects to spend approximately $210 million at Yanacocha (primarily for leach pad construction at the La Quinua and Carachugo sites, surface mine development, and a site water management plan), $95 million in Nevada (primarily for development of the Leeville underground mine, further development of the Deep Post underground mine, the Gold Quarry expansion and deferred stripping) and $10 million at Zarafshan Newmont (primarily for leach pad expansion and waste stripping). Newmont expects to fund 2002 capital expenditures from operating cash flow. 56 Other In 2000, Battle Mountain received shares of Lihir Gold as a result of its merger with Niugini Mining as described in Note 1, a portion of which were in exchange for Niuginis $54.7 million in cash. In 1999, Newmonts affiliates received $14.1 million from the sale of two exploration properties and $11.9 million from the sale of an investment in First Toronto Investments Limited, and paid an $11.0 million liquidating dividend related to the sale of the New World project in Montana. Financing Activities Newmonts $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into June 1997, was replaced in October 2001 with two unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 million facility with an initial term of 364 days, which may be extended annually to October 2006; and a $400 million revolving facility which matures in October 2006. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on Newmonts credit rating. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 0.77% to 1.25% or the greater of the federal funds rate or the lead banks prime rate. Annual fees vary from 0.10% to 0.30%. At December 31, 2001, the fees were 0.15% and 0.175% of the commitment for the $200 million and the $400 million facility, respectively. The facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified limitations on debt to capitalization, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, incurring liens and transactions with affiliates. There were no borrowings under the new facilities at December 31, 2001. Newmont is in compliance with all financial debt covenants. In July 1999, the Company entered into a prepaid forward gold sales contract (the Prepaid Forward) and a forward gold purchase contract (the Forward Purchase). Under the Prepaid Forward, the Company agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces (the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company also agreed under the Prepaid Forward to deliver semi annually 17,951 ounces of gold, beginning June 2000 through June 2007 (the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements) for a total gold delivery obligation over the life of the Prepaid Forward of 752,598 ounces. At the time the Prepaid Forward was entered into, the Company received net proceeds of $137.2 million ($145.0 million of gross proceeds before transaction costs of $653,000 and the purchase of a $7.1 million surety bond to guarantee delivery of the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company may also be entitled to receive additional proceeds in the future in connection with the annual deliveries of 161,111 ounces, to be determined at each delivery date based on the excess, if any, of the then market price for gold (up to a maximum of $380 per ounce) over $300 per ounce. At the time the Company entered into the Prepaid Forward, it also entered into the Forward Purchase, with the same counterparty, to hedge the price risk with respect to the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements. The Forward Purchase provides for semi annual purchases of 17,951 ounces of gold on each semi annual delivery date under the Prepaid Forward at prices increasing from $263 per ounce in 2000 to $354 per ounce in 2007. On each semi annual delivery date, the ounces purchased under the Forward Purchase were delivered in satisfaction of the Companys delivery requirements under the Prepaid Forward. The transaction has been accounted for as a single borrowing of $145 million, with interest accruing, based on an effective interest rate recognized over the full term of the borrowing (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In May 2001, Newmont issued $275 million of public unsecured notes due May 2011 bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625%. Proceeds of $272 million, after transaction costs, were used to repay debt outstanding under Newmonts revolving credit facility, with the remainder for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in May and November and the notes are redeemable prior to maturity under certain conditions. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. 57 In December 2000, Zarafshan Newmont obtained a $30 million additional facility, expiring in 2007, with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be used to expand leach pad capacity. The interest rate on this facility is based on the three month LIBOR plus 3.25%. At December 31, 2001, $30 million ($15 million Newmonts share) was outstanding and no borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2000. Newmont guarantees 50% of borrowings under this facility. Battle Mountain Canada had $87.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2000 under a loan agreement with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. In January 2001, subsequent to the merger with Battle Mountain, Newmont repaid this loan with $40 million of restricted cash and with borrowings from its revolving credit facility. Scheduled minimum long term debt repayments associated with stand alone Newmont financing facilities at December 31, 2001 are $192.1 million in 2002. Newmont expects to fund maturities of its debt from operating cash flow, by refinancing the debt as it becomes due, and subsequent to the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada, from combined cash balances. On March 18, 2002, Newmont, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, made an offer to repurchase any and all of the outstanding 8 7/8% Senior Notes due 2008 of Normandy Yandal Operations Limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont. As of the offer date, $300 million principal amount of notes was outstanding. The repurchase offer was made pursuant to the terms of an Indenture dated as of April 7, 1998, between Normandy Yandal and the Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Indenture requires that Normandy Yandal, following a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture, make an offer (a Change of Control Offer) to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. Although the applicable provisions of the Indenture can be read to the contrary, Newmont is taking the position that a Change of Control occurred on February 20, 2002 when Newmont acquired control of Normandy Mining Limited of which Normandy Yandal is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. The Indenture provides that Normandy Yandal is not required to make the Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the offer. Newmonts offer, however, should not be construed as a commitment by Newmont to provide ongoing financial or credit support to Normandy Yandal. The Change of Control Offer is open until May 14, 2002, unless extended. At this time, Newmont cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the Change of Control Offer or the amount Newmont will be required to pay under the Change of Control Offer. In conjunction with the Battle Mountain merger in January 2001, Newmont issued 24.1 million shares of Newmont common stock and 2.3 million shares of $3.25 convertible preferred Newmont stock. The preferred stock is convertible into shares of Newmont common stock at any time at a conversion ratio of 0.5 share of Newmont common stock. Holders of Newmont convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by Newmonts board of directors, an annual cash dividend of $3.25 per share, or $7.5 million for all shares, payable in equal quarterly installments. In conjunction with the acquisitions of Franco Nevada and Normandy, Newmont will issue approximately 194 million shares (including share equivalents). The A$0.50 per share cash portion of the Normandy purchase price will total approximately $465 million. Following the acquisitions, combined debt, net of cash balances, is expected to total approximately $2.2 billion. Developments in Indonesia Newmont operates the Minahasa mine on the island of Sulawesi and the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa. Both are in remote locations and have been largely unaffected by civil unrest coinciding with the recent period of political and social change in Indonesia. Both mines operate under Contracts of Work issued by the central government. Indonesias government has publicly expressed its intention to uphold existing Contracts of Work. Newmont continues to work with the local government and community leaders during this period of change. 58 Environmental Included in 2001 capital expenditures was approximately $12.1 million to comply with environmental regulations. Expenditures of $27.8 million are anticipated in 2002 on a Newmont stand alone basis. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of cash operating costs. Estimated future reclamation costs relating to currently producing mines are accrued over each mine life and at December 31, 2001, $128.4 million had been accrued. Newmont spent $8.1 million, $18.7 million and $20.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former mining sites discussed in Note 22, and expects to spend approximately $8.5 million in 2002 on a Newmont stand alone basis. In 2000 and 1999, the remediation liability associated with the San Luis property in Colorado was increased $13.2 million and $9.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2001, $57.3 million was accrued for total estimated future costs associated with all such obligations. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability may be as much as 50% greater or 30% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2001. Environmental obligations are continuously monitored and reviewed and, although Newmont believes that its reserves are adequate, as additional facts become known, further provisions may be required. In June 2000, a transport contractor of Minera Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles southwest of the mine. Mercury is a byproduct of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instrumentation and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Minera Yanacocha. In August 2000, Minera Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 soles (approximately US$500,000) to the Peruvian government. Minera Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. In addition, it has entered into agreements with three of the communities impacted by this incident to provide a variety of public works as compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident. On September 10, 2001, Minera Yanacocha, various wholly owned subsidiaries of Newmont, and other defendants were named in a lawsuit filed by over 900 Peruvian citizens in Denver District Court for the State of Colorado. This action seeks compensatory and punitive damages based on claims associated with the mercury spill incident. Estimated costs of $10 million for public works, remediation efforts, personal compensation and the fine were included in Other expense in 2000. Neither the Company nor Minera Yanacocha can reasonably predict the likelihood of any additional expenditures related to this matter.

The Company also has an interest in a copper/gold mine that commenced production in late 1999. These consolidated financial statements give effect to the NMC/Battle Mountain merger in January 2001. Results do not reflect the February 2002 acquisitions described below. On February 13, 2002, NMC stockholders approved adoption of an Agreement and Plan of Merger that provides for a restructuring of the Company to facilitate the February 2002 acquisitions described below and to create a flexible corporate structure. NMC merged with an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary that resulted in NMC becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed holding company. The new holding company, previously a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NMC, was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation. There is no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements of NMC as a result of this restructuring and former stockholders of NMC became stockholders of the new holding company. Restatements As further discussed in Note 23, Newmont has determined that certain adjustments are required to restate the Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and at December 31, 2001 and 2002. Overall the adjustments increased the net loss in the year ended December 31, 2001 by $23.4 million, or $0.12 per share, decreased net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $5.2 million, or $0.02 per share, and increased net loss for the year ended December 31, 1999 by $17.2 million, or $0.09 per share, respectively. The adjustments also increased the earnings of the years prior to 1999 by $52.7 million and therefore increased Stockholders equity by $19.7 million and $40.7 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, including Other comprehensive income of $2.4 million during 2001. These adjustments were necessary (i) to account for a prepaid forward sales contract and a forward purchase contract as a single borrowing; (ii) to correct depreciation rates on certain mining assets at the Companys subsidiary, Minera Yanacocha; (iii) to record the impact in the Companys investment in Batu Hijau, accounted for under the equity method, correcting its depreciation and deferred stripping calculations so as to exclude material other then proven and probable reserves; and (iv) to include depreciation depletion and amortization as a capitalized cost in inventory in both Newmont and its equity investment in Batu Hijau. See Note 23 for a detailed description of the effects of this restatement. All amounts in the accompanying footnotes have been adjusted for these restatements as appropriate. Normandy Mining Limited and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited Acquisitions In November 2001, the Company announced proposed acquisitions of Normandy Mining Limited (Normandy), an Australian company, and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited (Franco Nevada), a Canadian company. See further discussion at Note 24. Battle Mountain Merger On January 10, 2001, the Company completed a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company (Battle Mountain) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of June 21, 2000, under which each share of common stock of Battle Mountain and each exchangeable share of Battle Mountain Canada Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Battle Mountain) was converted into the right to receive 0.105 shares of NMC, resulting in the issuance of approximately 24.1 million shares. The Company also exchanged 2.3 million shares of newly issued $3.25 convertible preferred stock for all outstanding shares of Battle Mountain $3.25 convertible preferred stock. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and as such, the Consolidated Financial Statements include Battle Mountains financial data as if Battle Mountain had always been part of NMC. 65 The Company incurred merger expenses totaling $35 million, of which $20 million related to investment advisory and professional fees and $15 million to employee benefit and severance costs. The majority of such expenses were charged to income in 2001. The following table sets forth results of operations of the previously separate companies for the periods before the combination: Years Ended December 31, 2000 1999 (In millions) Sales Pre merger: NMC(1) $ 1,564.5 $ 1,398.9 Battle Mountain 254.5 228.2 Post merger: $ 1,819.0 $ 1,627.1 Net income (loss) applicable to common shares: Pre merger: NMC(1) $ (13.1 ) $ 7.8 Battle Mountain(1) (84.1 ) (127.1 ) Post merger: $ (97.2 ) $ (119.3 ) (1) As restated. See Note 23. Niugini Mining and Lihir Gold Merger Battle Mountain held a 50.45% interest in Niugini Mining and, through this interest at December 31, 1999, held a 7.52% in Lihir Gold that operates a gold mine in Papua New Guinea. In February 2000, Lihir Gold merged with Niugini Mining whereby Niugini Mining shareholders received one share of Lihir Gold for each share of Niugini Mining, together with one additional share of Lihir Gold for each A$1.45 of Niugini Minings net cash balance of $54.7 million. As a result of the merger, Battle Mountain received 111.3 million shares of Lihir Gold, representing a 9.74% interest reflected in Marketable securities of Lihir as a cost investment available for sale. Prior to 2000, Niugini Mining was consolidated into the Companys results and its interest in Lihir Gold was accounted for as an equity investment. At December 31, 2000, Lihir securities were written down by $23.9 million as an other than temporary loss resulting from the length of time and extent to which their market value had been less than their cost basis. During 2001, unrealized holding gains of $18.3 million, net of tax, were credited to Other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect the market value increase throughout the year. Operations The Companys sales result from operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Australia. Gold mining requires the use of specialized facilities and technology. The Company relies heavily on such facilities to maintain its production levels. Also, the cash flow and profitability of the Companys current operations are significantly affected by the market price of gold and copper. These commodity prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Companys control. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Newmont Mining Corporation and the more than 50% owned subsidiaries that it controls. The Company also includes its pro rata share of assets, liabilities and operations for unincorporated joint ventures in which it has an interest. All significant intercompany balances 66 and transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency for all subsidiaries is the U. S. dollar, except for Canadian and Australian operations where the functional currency is the Canadian and Australian dollar, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of the short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury bills and high quality commercial paper and time deposits. Investments Short term investments that are intended to be held to maturity are carried at cost, which approximates market, and include Eurodollar, government and corporate obligations rated AA or higher. Investments in marketable securities available for sale are marked to market at each period end. Changes in value on such securities are recorded, net of tax, as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss). If declines in value are deemed other than temporary, losses are reflected in Net income (loss). Investments in incorporated entities in which the Companys ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the Company does not control, are accounted for by the equity method and are included in long term assets. Income or loss from such investments is included in Equity income (loss) and impairment of affiliates. Other investments in nonmarketable securities in which the Companys ownership interest is less than 20% and in which the Company has no significant influence are recorded at cost in long term assets. Unrealized gains or losses on these investments are included in Other comprehensive income (loss), while realized gains or losses are included in Net income (loss). Inventories In general, costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are inventoried. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The current portion of inventories is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next twelve months. Inventories not expected to be processed within the next twelve months are classified as long term. The major classifications of inventory are as follows: Stockpiles Stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons (via truck counts and or in pit surveys of the ore before stockpiling) added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces (based on assay data) and the recovery percentage (based on the process for which the ore is destined). Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Stockpiles are valued based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable depreciation depletion, and amortization relating to mining operations. Value is added to a stockpile based on the current mining cost per ton and removed at the average cost per recoverable ounce of gold in the stockpile. Leach Pads The recovery of gold from certain oxide ores is best achieved through the heap leaching process. Under this method, ore is placed on leach pads where it is permeated with a chemical solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The resulting pregnant solution is further processed in a leach plant where the gold in 67 solution is recovered. For accounting purposes, value is added to leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation depletion and amortization relating to mining operations. Value is removed from the leach pad as ounces are recovered in circuit at the leach plant based on the average cost per recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. The engineering estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on the leach process and ore type). In general, the leach pad production cycles project recoveries of approximately 50% to 70% of the placed recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and the engineering estimates are refined based on actual results over time. The ultimate recovery of gold from a pad will not be known until the leaching process is terminated. The current portion of leach pad inventories is determined based on engineering estimates of the quantities of gold at the balance sheet date, which are expected to be recovered during the next twelve months. In process In process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the specific mining operation, but include mill in circuit, leach in circuit, floatation and column cells, and carbon in pulp inventories. In process material is measured based on assays of the material fed to process and the projected recoveries of the respective plants. In process inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed to process attributable to the source material coming from the mine, stockpile or leach pad plus the in process conversion costs, including applicable depreciation relating to the process facility, incurred to that point in the process. Finished Goods Finished goods inventories represent saleable gold dor&eacute; or gold bullion and are valued at the average cost of the respective in process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus refining costs. Property, Plant and Mine Development Expenditures for new facilities or expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives of such facilities. Productive lives range from 2 to 21 years, but do not exceed the related estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves. Mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, costs incurred prospectively to develop the property are capitalized as incurred and are amortized using the units of production (UOP) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces mined from proven and probable reserves. At the Companys surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At the Companys underground mines, these costs include the building of access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production, including estimated costs to be incurred during the current calendar year at certain underground mining operations, are amortized using the 68 UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces mined from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that these costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are amortized over the specific ore area. Ongoing development expenditures to maintain production are charged to operations as incurred. During the third quarter of 2002, Newmont changed its accounting policy, retroactive to January 1, 2002, with respect to DD&A of Property, Plant and Mine Development to exclude future estimated development costs expected to be incurred for certain underground operations. Previously, the Company had included these costs and associated reserves in its DD&A calculations at certain of its underground mining operations. In addition, the Company further revised its policy such that costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are depreciated, depleted or amortized over the reserves associated with the specific ore area. These changes were made to better match DD&A with the associated ounces of gold sold and to remove the inherent uncertainty in estimating future development costs in arriving at DD&A rates. See discussion of subsequent events in Note 24. Significant payments related to the acquisition of land and mineral rights are capitalized. The recoverability of the cost of land and mineral rights is significantly impacted by exploration drilling results. The length of time between the acquisition of land and mineral rights and the time when management performs its exploration work will vary depending on the prioritization of the Companys exploration projects and the magnitude of its exploration budget. Management reviews the carrying values of land and mineral rights at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If a mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are depleted when production begins using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces mined from proven and probable reserves. If no mineable ore body is discovered, such costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined the property has no future economic value. Interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Gains or losses from sales or retirements of assets are included in Dividends, interest, and other income. Asset Impairment The Company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined using estimated future cash flow analysis. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed engineering life of mine plans. The term recoverable ounces refers to the estimated amount of gold that will be obtained from proven and probable reserves after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. Generally, all assets at a particular mine are used together to generate cash flow. At the Nevada operations, with a number of ore types and processing facilities, assets are grouped according to the processing facility at which ores will be processed. Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions and or the Companys performance could have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations (See Note 17). 69 In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, that established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121 (Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of), for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement was adopted on January 1, 2002, and there was no impact upon adoption. Revenue Recognition The Company changed its accounting method for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2000, effective January 1, 2000, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, such that revenue is recognized when the price is determinable and upon delivery and transfer of title of third party refined gold to the customer. Previously, revenue was recognized when the production process was complete or when gold was poured in dor form at the mine. Initial proceeds from prepaid forward sales contracts are recorded as debt and are recognized in income when the related gold is delivered. Deferred Stripping Costs In general, mining costs are charged to Costs applicable to sales as incurred. However, at open pit mines, which have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios over the mine life, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units of production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios; however industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Companys operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold with an equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there may be greater volatility in the Companys period to period results of operations. At the Companys gold mining operations, deferred stripping costs are charged to Costs applicable to sales as gold is produced and sold using the units of production method based on estimated recoverable ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, using a stripping ratio calculated as the ratio of total tons to be moved to total proven and probable ore reserves, and result in the recognition of the costs of waste removal activities over the life of the mine as gold is produced and sold. The application of the accounting for deferred stripping costs and the resulting differences in timing between costs deferred and amortization generally results in an asset on the balance sheet (deferred stripping costs), although a liability will arise if amortization exceeds costs deferred. At the Companys equity accounted Batu Hijau operation, deferred stripping costs are charged to Production costs as copper and gold are produced and sold using the units of production method based on estimated recoverable pounds and ounces, respectively, of proven and probable ore reserves, using a stripping ratio based on total tons to be moved to total pounds of copper and ounces of gold to be recovered over the life of the mine. In the fourth quarter of 2002, NTP determined that PTNNT had incorrectly included non reserve material in its deferred stripping calculations. As a result, NTP restated its financial statements beginning with the fourth quarter of 1999 through the third quarter of 2002. See Note 6. The average remaining life of the open pit mine operations where the Company defers mining costs is five years, which represents the average time period over which the deferred stripping costs will be amortized. The amortization of deferred stripping costs is reflected in the income statement in a pro rata manner over the remaining life of the open pit mine operations so that no unamortized balance remains at mine closure. Cash flows from the Companys individual mining operations are reviewed regularly, and at least annually, for the purpose of assessing whether any write downs to the deferred stripping cost balances are required. Historically, Newmont classified deferred stripping costs as a component of Property, Plant and Mine Development on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective January 1, 1999, Newmont has classified these costs 70 as separate line items, Deferred stripping costs and Current portion of deferred stripping costs, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total deferred stripping costs as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 of $91.6 million and $129.0 million, including current portions of $71.5 million and $44.3 million, respectively, have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. In addition, Newmont has historically classified additions to deferred stripping costs as a component of Additions to property, plant and mine development in Investing activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Effective January 1, 1999, Newmont also has classified additions to deferred stripping costs as a component of Amortization of deferred stripping costs, net in Operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. Additions to deferred stripping costs for the years ended as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 of $11.6 million, $33.5 million and $28.7 million, respectively, have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The foregoing changes, which have no impact to reported earnings, have been made to more accurately reflect the operating nature of the deferred stripping method. Reclamation and Remediation Costs Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Such costs related to active mines are accrued and charged over the expected operating lives of the mines using the units of production method based on proven and probable reserves. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on managements best estimate at the end of each period of the undiscounted costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement will be adopted January 1, 2003, when the Company will record the estimated present value of reclamation liabilities and increase the carrying amount of the related asset. Subsequently, the reclamation costs will be allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. The Company is in the process of quantifying the effect of adoption. Income and Mining Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of the Companys liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates a net deferred income tax liability or net deferred income tax asset for the Company as of the end of the year, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect as enacted. The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in the net deferred income tax liability or net deferred income tax asset balance for the year. Mining taxes represent Canadian provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes since such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. The Companys deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets that it believes will more likely than not fail to be realized. Foreign Currency Assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates in Canada and Australia are translated at exchange rates in effect at each period end. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Accumulated currency translation adjustments are included in Other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in the statement of operations in the period of the transaction. 71 Commodity and Financial Instruments On a limited basis the Company has entered into commodity contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold production. The Company does not acquire, hold or issue commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Put option contracts purchased by the Company provide the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified number of ounces of gold at a specified strike price. Put options qualify for deferral accounting such that gains or losses on the contracts are recognized as the designated production is delivered or as the options expire. The initial fair value of put options is recorded as an asset and is amortized over the term of the options. Call option contracts sold by the Company provide the contract holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified number of ounces of gold at a specified strike price. The call option contracts are recorded at fair value and are marked to market at each reporting date. Certain combination, time matched written call and purchased put options (known as collars) together provide a minimum and maximum potential price for contract ounces of gold. Premiums paid or received are included in sales revenue in the period such collars expire. The change in the intrinsic value of such instruments is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and the change in the time value is recorded currently in the statement of operations. Interest rate swaps are utilized by the Company to reduce interest rate risks. The swaps are recorded at fair value and are recognized as a component of interest expense at each reporting date. The Company hedges its exposure to market fluctuations in fuel prices from time to time. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and as such, gains or losses on the effective portion of these contracts are deferred until the fuel is delivered. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires recognition of all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measurement at fair value. Changes in the derivatives fair value are required to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Gains and losses on derivative hedging instruments must be recorded in either other comprehensive income (loss) or current earnings (loss), depending on the nature of the instrument. The Company made no substantive changes to its risk management strategy as a result of adopting SFAS No. 133. Derivative documentation policies were revised as necessary to comply with the new standard. Earnings Per Common Share Earnings or loss per share are presented for basic and diluted net income (loss) and, if applicable, for net income or loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or loss (the numerator) by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares (the denominator) for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share includes the same numerator, but the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive common shares had been issued (such as the common share equivalents for employee stock options). Comprehensive Income In addition to net income, comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period (such as adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of marketable securities held for sale or other investments), except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. 72 Use of Estimates The preparation of Newmonts Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most critical accounting principles upon which Newmonts financial position and results of operations depend are those requiring estimates of proven and probable reserves, recoverable ounces therefrom, Newmonts ability to renew the mining leases upon which certain of those reserves are located, and or assumptions of future gold and copper prices. Such estimates and assumptions affect the value of inventories (which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value), the potential impairment of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. These estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which depreciation, depletion and amortization are charged to earnings. As noted above, commodity prices significantly affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow. In addition, management estimates costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as remediation costs for inactive properties as described below. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior year have been reclassified to conform to the 2001 presentation.

NOTE 6 INVESTMENT IN BATU HIJAU The Company and an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation (Sumitomo) are partners in the Nusa Tenggara Partnership (NTP) that holds 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (PTNNT), the owner of the Batu Hijau copper/gold mine in Indonesia. PTNNT obtained rights to conduct mining operations under a Contract of Work with the government of Indonesia. Batu Hijau production began in the fourth quarter of 1999, with a projected mine life in excess of 18 years and a development cost of approximately $1.83 billion. The Company and Sumitomo have an indirect 45% and 35% interest, respectively, in PTNNT. The remaining 20% interest is held by an unrelated Indonesian company. Because the Company and Sumitomo have 74 carried the investment of the 20% owner, the Company and Sumitomo recognize 56.25% and 43.75% of Batu Hijaus net income (loss), respectively, until recouping the bulk of its construction investment, including interest. Under the Contract of Work, a portion of PTNNT not already owned by Indonesian nationals must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals, beginning in the sixth year after mining operations commenced. The effect of this provision could potentially reduce the Companys and Sumitomos ownership to 49% by the end of the tenth year. The Company accounts for its investment in Batu Hijau as an equity investment due to each partners significant participating rights in the business and the unanimous approval required for major partnership decisions. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, such investment was $543.3 million and $521.6 million, respectively. Differences between 56.25% of NTPs net assets and the Companys investment include (i) $205 million for the fair market value adjustment recorded by NTP in conjunction with the Companys initial contribution, net of amortization, (ii) $26 million for inter company charges, (iii) $114 million for the fair market value adjustment recorded by the Company in conjunction with the acquisition of a prior minority interest in the Company, net of amortization, and (iv) $140 million for contributions recorded by the Company that were classified as debt by NTP. Certain of these amounts are amortized or depreciated on a units of production basis. The Companys investment also reflects $42 million for exploration expenditures incurred prior to the formation of NTP. (See Note 18 for a description of the Companys equity loss in Batu Hijau. Batu Hijaus Net income (loss) reflects the elimination of interest between PTNNT and NTP). Batu Hijau development was funded by $1.0 billion from third party loans (Senior Debt) and $0.83 billion from the Company and Sumitomo. The Senior Debt was guaranteed by the Company and Sumitomo, 56.25% and 43.75%, respectively, until project completion tests were met in October 2000, at which time the debt became non recourse to the Company. Repayment of borrowings under the Senior Debt is scheduled for semi annual installments of $43.4 million from May 2001 through November 2010. The semi annual installments will be reduced to $22.1 million from May 2011 through November 2013. The interest rate is based on blended fixed and floating rates. The weighted average interest rates were 6.8% and 6.6% during 2001 and 2000, respectively, and 5.0% and 7.0% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In May 2001, PTNNT entered into a non recourse term loan for $22.5 million, maturing May 15, 2005. Interest on the term loan is paid semi annually in May and November and is based on the six month LIBOR plus 2%. At December 31, 2001, the term loan interest rate was 4.0% and the effective interest rate was 5.7% for 2001. Newmont and Sumitomo have a contingent obligation to provide a $125 million support facility on a pro rata basis, if required, and as of December 31, 2001, $9 million had been provided by the Company under this facility. The Company and Sumitomo will be required to provide additional funds under this contingent support facility during 2002. The amount of this contingent support will depend on copper and gold prices, necessary capital expenditures at Batu Hijau, and required principal and interest payments. In the fourth quarter of 2002, NTP determined that PTNNT had incorrectly included material other than proven and probable reserves in its depreciation and deferred stripping calculations. NTP also determined that PTNNT had incorrectly included third party smelting and refining charges as a component of production costs when such charges are more properly reflected as a reduction of revenue based on the terms of NTPs sales contracts. Furthermore, NTP determined that PTNNT had incorrectly excluded DD&A as a capitalized cost in inventory. As result, NTP restated its financial statements from 1999 through 2001. 75 Following is summarized financial information for NTP based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The results of operations and assets and liabilities of NTP are not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. As described above, the Company accounts for NTP as an equity investment. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) Revenues, net of smelting and refining costs (2) $ 346,533 $ 337,579 $ 11,782 Revenues from by product sales credited to production costs $ 145,260 $ 91,347 $ 3,415 Net income (loss)(1) $ (11,182 ) $ (84,575 ) $ 14,956 At December 31, 2001 2000 (In thousands) Current assets(1) $ 162,686 $ 210,198 Property, plant and mine development, net (1) $ 1,940,335 $ 2,015,368 Other assets (1) $ 273,737 $ 160,107 Debt and related interest to partners and affiliates $ 254,891 $ 283,504 Other current liabilities $ 124,153 $ 138,119 Long term debt third parties (including current portion) $ 935,771 $ 1,000,000 Other liabilities (1) $ 163,993 $ 93,655 (1) As restated. See Note 23. (2) As restated to reflect smelting and refining costs as a reduction of revenue. The Batu Hijau operation produces a metal concentrate, which contains payable copper and gold and minor values of payable silver. PTNNT has entered into long term contracts for the sale of these metal concentrates with highly reputable refiners in Japan, Korea, Australia, China (Non European Refiners) and Europe (European Refiners). In accordance with the contracts, title to the concentrates and the risk of loss are passed to the buyer when the concentrates are moved over the vessels rail at the Port (loading Port for Non European Refiners and unloading Port for European Refiners). The contract terms provide that 90% of a provisional sales price, which is calculated in accordance with terms specified in the individual contracts based on an initial assay and weight certificate, is collected within three business days after the concentrates arrive at the smelter (final delivery). Factors entering into the calculation of the provisional sales price are (1) metals prices, pursuant to the terms of related contracts, calculated using quoted London Metals Exchange (LME) prices for the second calendar week prior to shipment, and (2) treatment and refining charges. The balance of the sales price is received at final settlement and is based on final assays and weights, and final metal prices during the respective metal quotational periods. The quotational period for copper is the average LME price in the third month following the month of final delivery. The quotational period for gold and silver is the average LME price in the month of shipment. Final delivery to Non European Refiners and European Refiners takes approximately 14 days and 30 days, respectively. The majority of the Batu Hijau concentrates are shipped to Non European Refiners. Accordingly, the time between initial recording of revenue and final settlement averages approximately three and one half months but could be as long as four months. In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), certain conditions must be met prior to recognizing revenue. These conditions are persuasive evidence of a contract exists; delivery has occurred; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. In accordance with SAB 101, PTNNT recognizes metal sales revenues following: (1) the passage of title after the loading or unloading of the concentrates, (2) issuance of an initial assay and weight certificate, and (3) issuance of a provisional invoice. At this point in time, the sales price is determinable since it is based on defined contract terms, initial assays are available, and it can be reasonably estimated by reference to published price indices on actively and freely traded commodity exchanges. Additionally, there is no significant uncertainty as to collectability given that all of the refiners are of high credit quality and that 90% of the provisional price is paid within 3 business days of final delivery at the refiner. 76 Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on 100% of the provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to take into account metal price changes, based upon the month end spot price and metal quantities upon receipt of the final assay and weight certificates, if different from the initial certificates. Effective January 1, 2002, PTNNT changed its methodology to mark to market its provisional sales based on the forward price for the estimated month of settlement. This change in methodology did not have a material effect on net income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. The principal risks associated with recognition of sales on a provisional basis include metal price fluctuations between the date recorded and the date of final settlement. In addition, in the event of a significant decline in metal prices between the provisional pricing date and the final settlement pricing period, it is reasonably possible that PTNNT would be required to return a portion of the sales proceeds received based on the provisional invoice. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, PTNNT had recorded revenues of $81.0 million, $117.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, which were subject to final pricing adjustments. The average price adjustment for copper was 4.3% and 1.6% for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average price adjustment for gold was 0.01% and 0.05% for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. No final price adjustments occurred in 1999 as no sales were finalized as of December 31, 1999. PTNNTs sales based on a provisional sales price contain an embedded derivative which is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward LME price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. At December 31, 2001, PTNNT had consolidated embedded copper derivatives on 122.6 million pounds recorded at an average price of $0.66 per pound. A one cent movement in the average price used for these derivatives will have an approximate $0.7 million impact on PTNNTs net income. Revenue from the sale of by products is credited to costs applicable to sales in the determination of net income for each period presented. These by product commodities, gold and silver, represented 42%, 27% and 29% of revenues and reduced production costs by 48%, 28% and 20% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Gold and silver revenues, which are recorded as by product credits, are significant to the economics of the Batu Hijau operation. At current copper prices, the Batu Hijau operation would not be profitable without these credits. PTNNT does not acquire, hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Financial instruments are used to manage certain market risks resulting from fluctuations in commodity prices (such as copper and diesel fuel) and foreign currency exchange rates. Copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are effectively determined by the LME. On a limited basis, PTNNT hedges sales commitments by entering into copper swap contracts. These swap contracts are generally settled against the LME average monthly price in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Currently, PTNNT has put in place derivative instruments against the price of copper, Australian dollar and some of its diesel purchases. The derivative instruments on the Australian dollar relate to Australian denominated purchases. 77 NOTE 7 OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES At December 31, 2001 2000 (In thousands) Payroll and related benefits $ 70,866 $ 67,129 Interest(1) 41,265 37,518 Taxes other than income 11,796 9,249 Reclamation and remediation 8,754 11,884 Utilities 8,237 6,448 Income and mining taxes 4,474 11,372 Deferred revenue 966 14,850 Royalties 602 1,624 Other 67,105 67,630 $ 214,065 $ 227,704 (1) As restated.

See Note 23. Scheduled minimum long term debt repayments are $192.1 million in 2002, $77.3 million in 2003, $81.9 million in 2004, $388.7 million in 2005, $95.4 million in 2006 and $591.5 million thereafter. Sale Leaseback of the Refractory Ore Treatment Plant In September 1994, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback agreement for its refractory ore treatment plant located at Carlin, Nevada. The transaction was accounted for as debt and the cost of the refractory ore treatment plant was recorded as a depreciable asset. The lease term is 21 years and aggregate future minimum lease payments, which include interest, were $489.7 million and $519.4 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Principal payments are $29.7 million annually over the next four years, increasing to $35.5 in the fifth year and beyond. The lease includes purchase options during and at the end of the lease at predetermined prices. The interest rate on this sale leaseback transaction is 6.36%. In connection with this transaction, the Company entered into certain interest rate hedging contracts that were settled for a gain of $11 million, which is recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the lease. Including this gain, the effective interest rate on the borrowing is 6.15%. Because this asset is specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. 80 Credit Facilities The Companys $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into June 1997, was replaced in October 2001 with two unsecured multi currency revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 million facility with an initial term of 364 days, which may be extended annually to October 2006; and a $400 million revolving facility, which matures in October 2006. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the Companys credit rating. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 0.77% to 1.25% or the greater of the federal funds rate or the lead banks prime rate. Annual fees vary from 0.10% to 0.30%. At December 31, 2001, the fees were 0.15% and 0.175% of the commitment, for the $200 million and the $400 million facility, respectively. The facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified limitations on debt to capitalization, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, incurring liens and transactions with affiliates. There were no borrowings under the new facilities as of December 31, 2001. The Company is in compliance with all financial debt covenants. 8 3/8% Debentures Unsecured debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million maturing July 1, 2005, bearing an annual interest rate of 8.375% were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable semi annually in January and July and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The costs related to the issuance of the debentures were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the debentures. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these debentures was approximately $205.9 million and $202.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 8 5/8% Notes Unsecured notes with a principal amount of $150 million due April 1, 2002, bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625% were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable semi annually in April and October and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these notes was $151.2 million and $153.9 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In May 2001, Newmont issued unsecured notes with a principal amount of $275 million due May 2011 bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625%. Proceeds of $272 million, after transaction costs, were used to repay debt outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility, with the remainder for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in May and November and the notes are redeemable prior to maturity under certain conditions. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these notes was $275.9 million at December 31, 2001. 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Unsecured debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million maturing January 2005 bearing an annual interest rate of 6% were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable annually in January and the debentures are convertible at the option of the holders into shares of common stock at any time on or after January 10, 2001 and prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed at the option of the Company. The conversion rate is 25.45 shares for each $5,000 principal amount of debentures converted. Approximately 509,000 shares of common stock have been registered for issuance upon conversion of these debentures. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these debentures was approximately $100.0 million and $82.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 81 Medium Term Notes Unsecured notes with a principal amount of $32 million maturing on various dates beginning early 2003 to late 2004, bearing an annual weighted average interest rate of 7.68%, were outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Interest is payable semi annually in March and September and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these notes was $32.7 million and $31.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) Loan Battle Mountain Canada entered into a $145.0 million loan with CIBC in conjunction with its purchase of Niugini Mining that was secured by Niugini Mining stock. In January 2001, the loan was paid in full with a $40 million collateral cash account and from the Companys revolving credit facility. The interest rates were variable and the weighted average interest rate was 7.6% for 2000. Prepaid Forward Transaction In July 1999, Newmont entered into a prepaid forward sales contract (Prepaid Forward) under which it agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces. The Prepaid Forward also included semi annual delivery requirements of 17,951 ounces of gold, beginning June 2000 through June 2007 for a total delivery obligation over the life of the contract of 752,598 ounces. The Company received net proceeds from this transaction of $137.2 million ($145.0 million of gross proceeds before transaction costs of $653,000 and the purchase of a $7.1 million surety bond) that was recorded as deferred revenue, included in the long term liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet and was to be recognized into income incrementally when the 161,111 ounce annual gold deliveries were made in 2005, 2006 and 2007. At the time the Company entered into the Prepaid Forward, it also entered into a forward gold purchase contract (Forward Purchase), with the same counterparty, to hedge the price risk with respect to the semi annual delivery requirements. The Forward Purchase provides for semi annual purchases of 17,951 ounces of gold on each semi annual delivery date under the Prepaid Forward at prices increasing from $263 per ounce in 2000 to $354 per ounce in 2007. On each semi annual delivery date through December 31, 2001, the ounces purchased under the Forward Purchase were delivered in satisfaction of the Companys delivery requirements under the Prepaid Forward. As discussed in Note 23, Newmont determined that the accounting treatment for this transaction required correction as the contract did not meet the technical criteria necessary to be accounted for in the manner reflected in the historical consolidated financial statements. To properly account for the transaction, the Companys long term debt was increased by $145.0 million as the Prepaid Forward and related Forward Purchase are treated under a financing accounting model and accounted for as a single borrowing of $145.0 million in July 1999, with interest accruing, based on an effective interest rate recognized over the full term of the borrowing. Using relevant future market conditions and financial models, the estimated fair value of these contracts was approximately $171.6 million and $164.7 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest Rate Swaps During the last half of 2001, the Company entered into contracts to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its $275 million 8 5/8% notes and its $200 million 8 3/8% debentures. The Company receives fixed rate interest payments at 8 5/8% or 8 3/8% and pays floating rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 4.25%. The notional principal amount of these transactions (representing the amount of principal tied to floating interest rate exposure) was $200 million at December 31, 2001. Half of these contracts expire in July 2005 and half expire in May 2011. These transactions have been designated as fair value hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $0.6 million. The fair value of the related debt was also adjusted to reduce the liability by a corresponding amount. At December 31, 2001, these transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $0.8 million. 82 Project Financings Minera Yanacocha Trust Certificates: Minera Yanacocha issued debt through the sale of $100 million 8.4% Series A Trust Certificates to various institutional investors. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, $64.0 million and $78.0 million, respectively, was outstanding under the financing. Interest on the Certificates is fixed at 8.4% and repayments are required quarterly through 2004. The Certificates are secured by certain of Minera Yanacochaa assets, certain restricted funds and also are specifically secured by future gold sales, through a trust agreement with the Bank of New York. Because these Certificates are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. $100 million Credit Facility: In December 1999, Minera Yanacocha entered into a $100 million credit facility with the International Finance Corporation. The two tier facility (a $20 million A Tranche and a $80 million B Tranche) is revolving and converts into term loans. The A Tranche has a five year revolving availability period and converts to a five year term loan. The B Tranche has a three year revolving availability period and converts to a four year term loan. Initial drawdowns under the loan were used for development of the La Quinua project; however, the loan accommodates repayments during the revolving availability period and any subsequent borrowings may be used for other development purposes. Interest applicable to the A Tranche is based on LIBOR plus 2.375%. Interest applicable to the B Tranche is based on LIBOR plus 2.0% through the second anniversary of the agreement, LIBOR plus 2.25% from year two to year four and after the fourth anniversary LIBOR plus 2.5%. The A Tranche interest rate was 5.5% and 8.3% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average rate was 7.7% and 8.3% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The B Tranche interest rate was 5.2% and 8.3% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average rate was 7.3% and 8.3% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The outstanding amount under this credit line was $100.0 million and $45.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001 and 2000. $20 million Credit Facility: Minera Yanacocha has a $20 million line of credit with Banco de Credito del Peru that expires in July 2004. The interest rate is LIBOR plus 2% and is adjusted annually to current market rates. The interest rate was 4.6% and 8.6 % at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average interest rate was 6.5% and 8.6% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The outstanding amount under this credit line was $13.0 million and $8.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001 and 2000. Leases: In December 1999, Minera Yanacocha assumed certain lease and purchase agreements for mining equipment that expire at various dates from December 2002 to June 2006. The net present value of future minimum payments was $6.3 million and $8.3 million, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with an interest component of 8.7% and 11.1% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Because these assets are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. All Minera Yanacocha debt is non recourse to the Company and is secured by substantially all of Minera Yanacochas property, plant and equipment; see above for specific security on the Trust Certificates. Zarafshan Newmont The Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, is a 50% participant in the Zarafshan Newmont joint venture (Zarafshan Newmont) in the Republic of Uzbekistan. The other participants are two Uzbek government entities. Zarafshan Newmont has a loan with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) secured by the assets of the project. The outstanding amount was $12.0 million and $18.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loan is to be repaid in semi annual installments of $6.0 million, which began in 83 July 2001. The interest rate is based on the three month LIBOR plus 4.25%. The weighted average interest rates were 8.7% and 10.9% for 2001 and 2000, respectively, and the interest rates at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were 6.1% and 10.7%, respectively. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001 and 2000. In December 2000, Zarafshan Newmont completed an additional $30 million loan under the EBRD facility that will be used primarily for capital expansion. The outstanding amount on this loan was $30.0 million at December 31, 2001, of which $15 million was the Companys share. No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2000. The loan facility will be available through December 15, 2002 and will be repaid in eight equal semi annual payments of $3.75 million, beginning July 2003 and ending January 2007. The interest rate is based on the three month LIBOR plus 3.25%. The interest rate was 5.1% at December 31, 2001 and the weighted average interest rate was 8.3% for 2001. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of this debt approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2001. The assets of Zarafshan Newmont secure both loans and in addition, the Company has guaranteed 50% of the loans and the Uzbek partners have guaranteed the remaining 50%. Inti Raymi In conjunction with the development of its Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia, Inti Raymi arranged a term credit facility with various international lending institutions with a fixed interest rate of 11.0%. The loan was paid in full in June 2001. In 2001, Inti Raymi entered into a capital lease for mining equipment that expires in May 2003. The net present value of the lease payments was $2.5 million at December 31, 2001, with an interest component of 10.25%. Because these assets are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt. Capitalized Interest Capitalized interest was $10.6 million, $5.5 million and $23.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. NOTE 10 SALES CONTRACTS, COMMODITY AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Option Contracts and Price Capped Sales Contracts In late July and early August 1999, the Company purchased put option contracts for 2.85 million ounces of gold, with a strike price of $270 per ounce. This purchase was paid for by selling call option contracts for 2.35 million ounces at the strike prices noted below. Put option contracts for one million ounces were subject to termination if the market price reached $270 per ounce at any time prior to such contracts expiration dates, which were August 2000 through July 2001. These put option contracts were thus terminated in September 1999. The put options qualified for deferral accounting such that gains and losses on the contracts were recognized as the designated production was delivered or as the options expired. The initial fair value of the options of $37.6 million was recorded as put option premiums and was amortized over the term of the options. In 2000 and 1999, $19.1 million and $18.5 million, respectively, was amortized in Sales, including the premiums associated with terminated put options. The call option contracts, with an initial fair value of $37.6 million, were marked to market at each reporting date. Noncash gains of $1.8 million and $26.8 million were recorded in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and a loss of $44.8 million was recorded in 1999. In September 2001, the Company entered into transactions that closed out these call options. The options were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under the terms of the contracts, Newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $350 per ounce in 2005 to $392 per ounce in 2011. 84 The value of the sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. As of December 31, 2001, the following price capped sales contracts were outstanding: Sold Call Options Ozs Price Cap 2005 500,000 $ 350 2008 1,000,000 $ 384 2009 600,000 $ 381 2011 250,000 $ 392 Commodity Instruments In December 2001, the Company entered into a series of equal and offsetting positions to its commodity instruments for certain Battle Mountain operations that were outstanding at that time. These contracts effectively closed out its combination matched put and call options and flat forward contracts. The offsetting positions are marked to market in current earnings. As a result, the following were outstanding as of December 31, 2001: 2002 2003 2004 Total/Average Combination call and put options: Written call options: Ounces 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce $ 348 $ 348 $ 359 $ 348 Purchased call options: Ounces 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce $ 348 $ 348 $ 359 $ 348 Purchased put options: Ounces 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce $ 286 $ 286 $ 296 $ 286 Written put options: Ounces 92,752 92,752 7,563 193,067 Average strike price per ounce $ 286 $ 286 $ 296 $ 286 Flat forward contracts: Ounces 31,252 31,252 1,563 64,067 Average price per ounce $ 314 $ 314 $ 323 $ 314 Forward purchase contracts: Ounces 31,252 31,252 1,563 64,067 Average price per ounce $ 314 $ 314 $ 323 $ 314 The Company is not required to place collateral with respect to its commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. Credit risk is minimized by contracting only with major financial institutions/counterparties. These instruments had offsetting fair values at December 31, 2001. The combination call and put options contracts had a fair value of $2.7 million at December 31, 2000. The flat forward contracts had a negative fair value of $2.0 million at December 31, 2000. Fuel Contracts The Company uses certain derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its exposure to fuel price market fluctuations, from time to time. At December 31, 2001, the Company had contracts expiring September 2002 85 covering approximately 8.6 million gallons of diesel fuel at its Nevada operations at prices ranging from approximately $0.61 to $0.69 per gallon. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and at December 31, 2001, had a negative fair value of $1.3 million.

See Note 23. NOTE 12 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY NMC Common Stock. As discussed in Note 1, NMC issued 24.1 million shares in exchange for Battle Mountain common stock and Battle Mountain exchangeable shares in January 2001. The Company paid dividends of $0.12 per common share of NMC stock in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999. Convertible Preferred Stock: At December 31, 2001 and 2000, 2.3 million shares of $3.25 convertible preferred stock were outstanding, with a liquidation preference of $50 per share. In conjunction with the NMC/Battle Mountain merger, NMC issued 2.3 million shares of $3.25 convertible preferred stock in exchange for Battle Mountain preferred stock. The preferred stock is convertible into shares of NMC at any time at a conversion ratio of 0.5 share of NMC common stock and is redeemable at the option of the Company solely for shares of NMC common stock. Pursuant to the restructuring of the Company described above, preferred stockholders were granted voting rights. Holders of NMC convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Companys board of directors, an annual cash dividend of $3.35 per share, payable in equal quarterly installments. The Company paid $7.5 million in preferred stock dividends in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999. Stock Rights. In September 2000, the Company paid a dividend of one series A junior participating preferred stock purchase right (PSPR) for each outstanding share of NMC common stock. These rights replaced NMCs existing PSPRs that expired in September 2000. The rights agreement works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group, which acquires 15% or more of NMCs outstanding common stock without the approval of its board of directors. Each PSPR entitles the holder to purchase from NMC one one thousandth of a share of NMC participating preferred stock for $100 (subject to adjustment) once such rights become exercisable. Until exercised, holders of PSPRs have no stockholder rights. The PSPRs become exercisable only if a defined acquiring person has acquired 15% or more of NMC common stock or has begun a tender or exchange offer that would result in such person owning 15% or more of NMC common stock. If such events occur, PSPR holders (other than the acquiring person) may, for $100, purchase shares of NMC common stock (or in certain circumstances common stock of the acquiring company) with a market value of $200, based on the market price of NMC common stock prior to such acquisition (or the market price of the acquiring 86 corporations stock). NMC may redeem the PSPRs for $0.01 each prior to an announcement that a defined acquiring person exists. The PSPRs remain in place following the restructuring described in Note 1. NOTE 13 STOCK OPTIONS Employee Stock Options Under the Companys stock option plans, options to purchase shares of stock have been granted to key employees at the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant. The options under these plans vest over a two year period and, for certain options granted to key employees, over a four year period, and are exercisable over a period not exceeding ten years. At December 31, 2001, 5,472,645 shares were available for future grants under the Companys plans. In conjunction with the Battle Mountain merger, 850,000 shares of NMC common stock were authorized for issuance in connection with outstanding Battle Mountain stock options that were assumed by the Company. The following table summarizes annual activity for all stock options for each of the three years in the period ended December 31: 2001 2000 1999 All Stock Options Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at beginning of year 12,671,674 $ 29 11,511,797 $ 30 6,559,745 $ 38 Granted 1,439,548 $ 22 1,502,325 $ 19 5,253,469 $ 19 Exercised (403,673 ) $ 19 (110,500 ) $ 25 (1,625 ) $ 22 Forfeited (1,393,392 ) $ 33 (231,948 ) $ 37 (299,792 ) $ 36 Outstanding at end of year 12,314,157 $ 28 12,671,674 $ 29 11,511,797 $ 30 Options exercisable at year end 9,448,459 $ 29 7,501,483 $ 33 4,233,780 $ 42 Weighted average fair value of options granted during the year $ 12.98 $ 12.55 $ 11.90 The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001, with exercise prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant with no restrictions on exercisability after vesting (included in the All Stock Options table): Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Number Exercisable Weighted Average Exercise Price $13 to $19 4,243,657 6.8 years $18 3,543,689 $18 $20 to $24 2,782,732 8.2 years $22 1,257,896 $22 $25 to $29 1,863,649 6.4 years $27 1,502,091 $28 $30 to $35 479,613 5.9 years $32 492,330 $32 $36 to $44 1,465,952 4.2 years $39 1,454,848 $39 $45 to $59 767,610 4.1 years $54 723,301 $54 $60 to $79 86,388 2.9 years $70 86,388 $70 $80 to $108 121,202 4.1 years $99 121,202 $99 $13 to $108 11,810,803 6.5 years $27 9,181,745 $29 87 Certain key executives were granted options that, although the exercise price was equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, cannot be exercised when otherwise vested unless the market price of NMCs common stock is a defined amount above the option exercise price. In addition, the same executives were granted options with exercise prices in excess of the fair market value on the date of grant. Generally, these key executive options vest over a period of one to five years and are exercisable over a ten year period. At December 31, 2001, 503,354 of these options were outstanding and 266,714 were exercisable. Information about these stock options outstanding (included in the All Stock Options table) at December 31, 2001 is summarized below: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range ofExercisePrices Number Outstanding WeightedAverageRemainingContractual Life WeightedAverageExercisePrice NumberExercisable WeightedAverageExercisePrice Options with exercise prices in excess of the fair market value on the date of the grant $40 to $56 266,714 1.5 years $ 50 266,714 $ 50 Options that cannot be exercised until the market price exceeds a fixed amount above the exercise price $30 to $41 236,640 1.6 years $ 37 $ The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. Accordingly, because stock option exercise prices equal the market value on the date of grant, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock options. Had compensation cost for the options been determined based on market value at grant dates in 2001, 2000 and 1999 as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands, except per share): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net loss applicable to common sharesAs reported(1) $ (54,119 ) $ (97,187 ) $ (119,254 ) Pro forma(1) $ (55,564 ) $ (124,557 ) $ (146,300 ) Net loss per share, basic and dilutedAs reported(1) $ (0.28 ) $ (0.51 ) $ (0.62 ) Pro forma(1) $ (0.28 ) $ (0.65 ) $ (0.76 ) (1) As restated. See Note 23. For purposes of determining the pro forma amounts, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: weighted average risk free interest rates of 4.9%, 6.4% and 6.4%; dividend yield of 0.6% for all three years; expected lives of nine years, nine years and eight years; and volatility of 49%, 56% and 52%. Compensation costs included in the pro forma amounts reflect only fair values of options granted after January 1, 1995. These amounts may not be indicative of actual results had the Company used fair value based accounting for stock options. Other Stock Based Compensation In 1997, the Company adopted an intermediate term incentive plan (ITIP) under which restricted stock may be granted to certain key employees. These shares are granted upon achievement of certain financial and operating thresholds at fair market value on the grant date. ITIP stock grants are subject to certain restrictions related to ownership and transferability that currently lapse two years (for ownership) and, in some cases, five 88 years (for transfer) from the date of the grant. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, 248,601, 95,814 and 62,800 shares of restricted stock, respectively, were issued under ITIP, of which 254,491 shares remain restricted at December 31, 2001. Compensation expense recorded for these grants was $3.3 million, $2.4 million and $1.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2001, the Company adopted a deferred stock award plan under which deferred stock awards are granted to employees. The employees vest in the awards after two years, at which time the related shares are issued free of any restrictions. In 2001, deferred stock awards were granted equivalent to 214,000 shares of stock, of which 210,287 remain outstanding at December 31, 2001. Compensation expense recorded for these grants was $0.8 million in 2001. NOTE 14 EMPLOYEE PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS Pension Plans The Companys pension plans include: (1) two qualified non contributory defined benefit plans (for salaried employees and substantially all domestic hourly employees); (2) two non qualified plans (for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal legislation); and (3) a non qualified cash balance international plan (for select employees who are not eligible to participate in the U.S. based plans because of citizenship). The vesting period for each plan is five years of service. The plans benefit formulas are based on an employees years of credited service and either (1) such employees last five years average pay (salaried plan), (2) a percentage of annual pay (international plan) or (3) a flat dollar amount adjusted by a service weighted multiplier (hourly plan). Pension costs are determined annually by independent actuaries and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based on funding standards established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Other Benefit Plans The Company provides defined medical benefits to qualified retirees (and to their eligible dependents) who were salaried employees and defined life insurance benefits to qualified retirees who were salaried employees. In general, participants become eligible for these benefits upon retirement directly from the Company if they are at least 55 years old and the combination of their age and years of service with the Company equals 75 or more. Defined medical benefits cover most of the reasonable and customary charges for hospital, surgical, diagnostic and physician services and prescription drugs. Life insurance benefits are based on a percentage of final base annual salary and decline over time after retirement commences. 89 The following tables provide a reconciliation of changes in the plans benefit obligations and assets fair values for the two year period ended December 31, 2001 and a statement of the funded status as of December 31 of both years: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2001 2000 2001 2000 (In thousands) (In thousands) Change in Benefit Obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 189,346 $ 181,743 $ 45,062 $ 49,322 Service cost benefits earned during the year 8,075 7,530 2,422 2,570 Interest cost 14,545 13,631 3,700 3,209 Amendments 2,860 Actuarial loss (gain) 12,396 5,406 8,166 (8,573 ) Benefit enhancements for early retirement 15,682 1,311 Settlement gain (333 ) Foreign currency exchange gain (112 ) (289 ) (105 ) (36 ) Settlement payments (6,802 ) (12,431 ) Benefits paid (16,890 ) (8,771 ) (1,532 ) (1,430 ) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 216,240 $ 189,346 $ 59,024 $ 45,062 Change in Fair Value of Assets: Fair value of assets at beginning of year $ 163,249 $ 182,666 $ $ Actual return (loss) on plan assets 904 (1,588 ) Employer contributions 10,543 3,802 1,531 989 Foreign currency exchange loss (408 ) (567 ) Settlement payments (6,802 ) (12,293 ) Benefits paid (16,181 ) (8,771 ) (1,531 ) (989 ) Fair value of assets at end of year $ 151,305 $ 163,249 $ $ Funded status $ (64,935 ) $ (26,097 ) $ (59,024 ) $ (45,062 ) Unrecognized prior service cost 9,041 11,499 1,364 1,528 Unrecognized net loss (gain) 25,537 2,754 (16,115 ) (25,372 ) Unrecognized net (asset) obligation (120 ) 143 Accrued cost $ (30,477 ) $ (11,701 ) $ (73,775 ) $ (68,906 ) The Companys qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules and regulations. The Companys non qualified and other benefit plans are not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. The information contained in the above tables indicates the combined funded status of qualified and non qualified plans, in accordance with accounting pronouncements. Assumptions used for IRS purposes differ from those used for accounting purposes. The funded status shown above, prepared in accordance with accounting pronouncements, compares the projected benefit obligation of all plans, which is an actuarial present value of obligations that takes into account assumptions as to future compensation levels of plan participants, to the fair value of the assets held in trust for the qualified plans. Accounting pronouncements also prescribe a computation for the plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), which is an actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or nonvested) attributed to employees based on employee service and compensation prior to the end of the period presented. The following plans have an ABO in excess of the market value of plan assets: (1) qualified and non qualified pension plans for salaried employees, (2) the qualified pension plan for hourly employees and (3) the non qualified international pension plan. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, the ABO was $149.2 million and $100.2 million for the qualified pension plan for salaried employees, $17.4 million and $14.4 million for the qualified pension plan for hourly employees, $15.8 million and $15.7 million for the non qualified pension plan for salaried employees, and $2.4 million and $2.2 million for the non qualified international pension plan. 90 The following table provides amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2001 2000 2001 2000 (In thousands) (In thousands) Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets: Accrued benefit cost $ (38,555 ) $ (21,923 ) $ (73,775 ) $ (68,906 ) Intangible asset 5,014 6,357 Accumulated other comprehensive income 3,064 3,865 Net amount recognized $ (30,477 ) $ (11,701 ) $ (73,775 ) $ (68,906 ) In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, an adjustment was required to reflect a minimum liability for the non qualified pension plan in 2001, 2000 and 1999, and one of the hourly pension plans and the international plan in 2001. As a result of such adjustment, an intangible asset was recorded and (to the extent the minimum liability adjustment exceeded the unrecognized net transition liability) Stockholders equity was reduced $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $3.5 million (net of related deferred income tax benefits) at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The following table provides components of net periodic pension benefit cost for the indicated fiscal years: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) (In thousands) Components of net periodic pension benefit cost: Service cost $ 8,075 $ 7,530 $ 9,358 $ 2,422 $ 2,569 $ 4,022 Interest cost 14,545 13,631 12,723 3,700 3,209 3,511 Expected return on plan assets (15,513 ) (16,742 ) (14,824 ) Amortization of prior service cost 1,044 729 730 146 148 148 Amortization of loss (gain) 128 (393 ) 151 (1,102 ) (1,273 ) (262 ) Amortization of net obligation (asset) 143 (93 ) (204 ) Benefit enhancement for early retirement 20,811 1,328 Total net periodic pension benefitcost $ 29,233 $ 4,662 $ 7,934 $ 6,494 $ 4,653 $ 7,419 For the pension plans, prior service costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants. Postretirement benefits other than pensions are accrued during an employees service to the Company. On February 6, 2001, the Company informed certain of its employees of their eligibility to participate in an early retirement program. Participation in the program was entirely voluntary and could be elected anytime between February 7, 2001 and March 23, 2001. The program offered eligible employees three additional years of age and service when calculating their benefits under the Companys existing pension and post retirement benefit plans. In addition to the three years of age and service, employees were given a $500 per month supplement payable until age 62 or for two years if longer. Employees who elected the early retirement program also received a severance payment of two weeks of pay for each completed year of service plus four weeks. The employees could elect to receive the severance payment as a lump sum or in the form of a monthly payment. For those participants who were not yet eligible for post retirement medical coverage, they received medical coverage for three years, or until they met the eligibility requirement, whichever came first. The Company recognized a one time expense of approximately $22.1 million during the three month period ended March 31, 2001, when the obligation was incurred, during which the employees elected to participate in the early retirement program. 91 Assumptions used in measuring the Companys benefit obligation were as follows: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2001 2000 2001 2000 Weighted average assumptions as of December 31: Discount rate 7.25 % 7.75 % 7.25 % 7.75 % Expected return on plan assets 9.25 % 9.25 % N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % The assumed health care cost trend rate to measure the expected cost of benefits was 8% for 2002, 7% for 2003, 6% for 2004 and 5% each year thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on amounts reported for the health care plans. A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in thousands): 1% Increase 1% Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components of net periodicpostretirement health care benefit cost $ 1,409 $ (1,109 ) Effect on the health care component of the accumulated postretirementbenefit obligation $ 8,367 $ (6,360 ) Savings Plan The Company has four qualified defined contribution savings plans, two that cover salaried employees and two that cover substantially all hourly employees. In addition, the Company has two non qualified supplemental savings plans for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee contributions of up to 6% and 4% of base salary for the salaried and hourly plans, respectively. Matching contributions are made with NMC stock; however, no holding restrictions are placed on such contributions, which totaled $9.9 million in both 2001 and 2000, and $9.7 million in 1999. NOTE 15 DIVIDENDS, INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) Interest income $ 2,976 $ 10,542 $ 15,424 Foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net (5,088 ) (6,100 ) 8,200 Gain on sale of exploration properties 3,696 1,640 20,604 Other 6,401 4,199 3,757 Total $ 7,985 $ 10,281 $ 47,985 NOTE 16 EXPENSES FOR ACQUISITION SETTLEMENT In the third quarter of 2000, the Company resolved a long standing legal dispute regarding the acquisition of an additional interest in Minera Yanacocha, a gold mining operation located in Peru. The Company issued $40 million of NMC common stock, 2.6 million shares, under terms of the settlement, and charged $42.2 million, including expenses, to income. NOTE 17 WRITE DOWN OF ASSETS In 2001, the Company reduced the carrying value of its long lived and other assets by $57.8 million pre tax. The write down related to Minahasa ($18.9 million), Nevada ($22.6 million), Kori Kollo ($4.8 million), 92 Yanacocha ($4.1 million), the San Luis property in Colorado ($3.5 million) and other properties ($3.9 million). The write down of long lived assets represented the excess carrying value of assets compared to fair value, with fair value determined using discounted future cash flow analyses. Such cash flows are based on estimated recoverable ounces, future production and capital costs, and gold price assumptions. Gold price assumptions were $285 per ounce in 2002 and $300 per ounce thereafter. The Minahasa write down reduced fixed assets by $12.1 million, increased reclamation liabilities by $3.7 million, and reduced ore stockpile and materials and supply inventories by $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Nevada write down reduced ore and in process inventory by $7.3 million and fixed assets by $4.4 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced fixed assets by $4.8 million. The San Luis write down reduced fixed assets by $2.0 million and materials and supply inventory by $1.5 million. The restatement adjustments to capitalize DD&A in inventory (see Note 23) included write downs of inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value of $16.8 million in 2001. Of this amount, $5.7 million and $5.2 million related to write downs of stockpile and mill in process inventories, respectively, at Nevada, $4.1 million related to write downs of heap leach inventories at Minera Yanacocha and $1.8 million related to inventory write downs at other operations. In 2000, the write down of $75.9 million related to the Holloway mine in Canada ($30.8 million), the short lived Mesquite mine in California ($14.8 million), Nevada ($13.5 million) the Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia ($5.6 million), the acquisition cost of the Mezcala property in Mexico ($6.5 million), the Minahasa mine in Indonesia ($3.1 million), the Battle Mountain Complex in Nevada ($0.7 million) and other properties ($0.9 million). The Holloway write down reduced fixed assets by $30.8 million. Mesquites write down reduced leach pad inventory by $9.7 million, deferred stripping by $1.4 million and fixed assets by $3.7 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced inventory by $4.9 million and fixed assets by $0.7 million. The restatement adjustments to capitalize DD&A in inventory (see Note 23) included write downs of inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value of $17.5 million in 2000. Of this amount, $9.6 million and $3.9 million related to write downs of stockpile and mill in process inventories, respectively, at Nevada, $3.1 million to write downs of finished goods inventories at the Minahasa mine and $0.9 million to inventory write downs at other operations. In 1999, the write down of $59.2 million related to the Crown Jewel project in Washington ($35.9 million), Nevada stockpile inventories ($22.7 million) and other properties ($0.6 million). The Crown Jewel write down related to mine development costs and represented the remaining carrying value of the property as a result of permitting uncertainties resulting from a January 2000 decision from the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board decision that reversed its water rights permits and vacated its Clean Water Act certification. The restatement adjustments to capitalize DD&A in inventory (see Note 23) included write downs of inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value of $19.7 million in 1999. Of this amount, $19.2 million related to write downs of stockpile inventories at Nevada and $0.5 million to write downs at other operations. NOTE 18 EQUITY INCOME (LOSS) AND IMPAIRMENT OF AFFILIATES Years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) Equity income (loss) in Batu Hijau(1) $ 22,513 $ (17,690 ) $ (8,925 ) Equity (loss) in Lihir Gold (4,782 ) Lihir Gold impairment (76,170 ) Total $ 22,513 $ (17,690 ) $ (89,877 ) (1) As restated. See Note 23. 93 Financial information relating to the Companys equity investment in Batu Hijau was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) Copper sales, net of smelting and refining(2) $ 345,399 $ 337,011 $ 11,771 Interest income $ 1,122 $ 546 $ 11 Interest expense $ 120,389 $ 139,722 $ 17,145 Depreciation, depletion and amortization(1) $ 105,324 $ 93,300 $ 3,493 Net income (loss)(1) $ (34,819 ) $ (119,198 ) $ 13,385 Capital expenditures $ 46,261 $ 208,456 $ 600,291 Total assets at December 31,(1) $ 2,240,607 $ 2,243,252 $ 2,105,407 (1) As restated. See Note 23. (2) As restated to reflect smelting and refining costs as a reduction of revenue. The equity income in Batu Hijau was $22.5 million in 2001 (based on 56.25% of Batu Hijaus net loss of $34.8 million plus $26.4 million of eliminated inter company interest, $10.8 million for eliminated management fees, and $4.9 million for other items). In 2000, the Companys equity loss in Batu Hijau was $17.7 million (based on 56.25% of Batu Hijaus net loss of $119.2 million plus $33.5 million of eliminated inter company interest, $12.5 million for eliminated management fees, and $3.4 million for other items). In 1999, the equity loss in Batu Hijau was $8.9 million (based on 56.25% of Batu Hijaus net income of $13.4 million plus $3.3 million of eliminated intercompany interest, reduced by $20.6 million to reclassify deferred tax benefits and increased by $0.9 million for other items). As described in Note 1, Lihir Gold was accounted for as an equity investment prior to 2000. The Company recorded $76.2 million in 1999 for impairment losses resulting from declines in Lihir Golds market value. Beginning in 2000, Lihir Gold stock was carried as marketable equity securities held for sale and as of December 31, 2000, was written down $23.9 million as an other than temporary loss resulting from the length of time and extent to which their market value had been less than their cost basis. During 2001, unrealized holding gains of $18.3 million were charged to Other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect market value increases throughout the year. Newmont sold its investment in Lihir Gold in 2002. See Note 24. NOTE 19 ACCOUNTING CHANGES As described in Note 2, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2000, effective January 1, 2000, to record sales when the price is determinable and upon delivery and transfer of title of third party refined gold to the customer. Previously, revenue was recognized upon the completion of the production process, or when gold was poured into dor at the mine site. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2000 was $12.6 million, net of tax and minority interest. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to recognize derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value. As a result, the Company increased Other comprehensive income by $1.7 million as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method. 94 NOTE 20 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Net cash provided by operating activities included the following cash payments: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands) Income taxes, net of refunds $ 76,020 $ 86,608 $ 28,500 Interest, net of amounts capitalized(1) $ 91,944 $ 101,066 $ 73,422 (1) As restated. See Note 23. In the third quarter of 2001, NMC entered into transactions that closed out certain written call option contracts with a series of price capped contracts as described in Note 10. These transactions resulted in a non cash increase of $53.8 million to Deferred revenue from sale of future production for the initial fair value of these contracts. In 2001 and 2000, Kori Kollo and Minera Yanacocha, respectively, entered into certain leases (see Note 9) that resulted in a non cash increase to Property, plant and mine development and Long term debt ($3.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively). In 2000, NMC issued 2.6 million shares of common stock in conjunction with the acquisition settlement described in Note 16 that resulted in non cash increases to Common stock ($4.2 million) and additional paid in capital ($35.8 million). In December 1999, Minera Yanacocha assumed certain equipment lease and purchase agreements (see Note 9) that resulted in a non cash increase to Property, plant and mine development and Long term debt ($12.4 million). In the third quarter of 1999, NMC entered into two put and call option contracts described in Note 10. As a result, non cash increases to put option premiums and Fair value of written call options ($37.6 million) were recorded for the initial fair value of these contracts. NOTE 21 SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION The Company predominantly operates in a single industry as a worldwide corporation engaged in gold production, exploration for gold and acquisition of gold properties. The Company has operations in North America, South America, Indonesia, Uzbekistan and Australia, and its reportable segments are based on the geographic location of these operations.

In 2001, sales to two customers totaled $816 million and $326 million or 49% and 20% of total sales, respectively. In 2000, sales to one customer totaled $1.1 billion or 62% of total sales. In 1999, sales to two customers totaled $771 million and $531 million or 47% and 32%, respectively. NOTE 22 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Environmental Obligations The Companys mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, $128.4 million and $108.9 million, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the 98 compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Companys best estimate of its liability for these matters, $57.3 million and $63.5 million were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These amounts are included in Other accrued liabilities and Reclamation and remediation liabilities. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 50% greater or 30% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2001. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Costs and expenses, Other in the period estimates are revised. Details about certain of the more significant sites involved are discussed below. Idarado Mining Company (Idarado) 80.1% owned In July 1992, the Company and Idarado signed a consent decree with the State of Colorado (State), which was agreed to by the U.S. District Court of Colorado, to settle a lawsuit brought by the State under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), generally referred to as the Superfund Act. Idarado agreed in the consent decree to undertake specified remediation work at its former mining site in the Telluride/Ouray area of Colorado. Remediation work at this property is substantially complete. If the remediation does not achieve specific performance objectives defined in the consent decree, the State may require Idarado to implement supplemental activities at the site, also as defined in the consent decree. Idarado and the Company have obtained a $5.8 million reclamation bond to secure their potential obligations under the consent decree. In addition, Idarado settled natural resources damages and past and future response costs, and agreed to habitat enhancement work, under the consent decree. Resurrection Mining Company (Resurrection) 100% owned The Company, Resurrection and other defendants were named in lawsuits filed by the State of Colorado under the Superfund Act in 1983, which were subsequently consolidated with a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1986. These proceedings sought to compel the defendants to remediate the impacts of pre existing, historic mining activities near Leadville, Colorado, which date back to the mid 1800s, and which the government agencies claim are causing substantial environmental problems in the area. In 1988 and 1989, the EPA issued administrative orders with respect to one area on the site, and the defendants have collectively implemented those orders by constructing a water treatment plant, which was placed in operation in early 1992. Remaining remedial work for this area primarily consists of water treatment plant operation and continuing environmental monitoring and maintenance activities. The Company and Resurrection are currently responsible for 50 percent of these costs; their share of such costs could increase in the event other defendants become unable to pay their share of such costs. The parties also have entered into a consent decree with respect to the remaining areas at the site, which apportions liabilities and responsibilities for these areas. The EPA has approved remedial actions for selected components of Resurrections portion of the site, which were initiated in 1995. The EPA has not yet selected the final remedy for the site. Accordingly, the Company cannot yet determine the full extent or cost of its share of the remedial action that will be required. The government agencies may also seek to recover for damages to natural resources. In March 1999, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to facilitate the settlement of natural resources damages claims under CERCLA for the upper Arkansas River Basin. The MOU provides a structure for evaluation of damages and possible restoration activities that may be required if it is concluded such damages have occurred. 99 Dawn Mining Company LLC (Dawn) 51% owned Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the EPA. Dawn also owns a nearby uranium millsite facility, located on private land, which is subject to federal and state regulation. In 1991, Dawns mining lease at the mine was terminated. As a result, Dawn was required to file a formal mine closure and reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an analysis of Dawns proposed plan and alternate closure and reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been suspended indefinitely. In mid 2000, the mine was included on the National Priorities List under CERCLA, and the EPA has initiated a remedial investigation/feasibility study under CERCLA to determine environmental conditions and remediation options at the site. The EPA has asserted that Dawn and the Company are liable for reclamation or remediation work and costs at the mine. Dawn does not have sufficient funds to pay for the reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan, or for any additional remediation work or costs at the mine. The Company will vigorously contest any claims as to its liability. The Company cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future action against Dawn or the Company arising from this matter. In late 1999, Dawn initiated state approval for a revised mill closure plan that, if implemented, would expedite the reclamation process at the mill. The State of Washington has approved this revised plan. The currently approved plan for the mill is secured by a $14.1 million bond, which is guaranteed by the Company. San Luis, Colorado 100% owned The San Luis open pit gold mine in southern Colorado was operated by a subsidiary of Battle Mountain and ceased operations in November 1996. Since then, substantial closure and reclamation work has been performed. In August 1999, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) issued a notice of violation of the Water Quality Control Act, and in October 1999 amended the notice to authorize operation of a water treatment facility and the discharge of treated water. Battle Mountain has made all submittals required by the CDPHE notice and has conducted the required response activities. Battle Mountain negotiated a settlement with CDPHE resolving alleged violations, which became effective September 1, 2000. In October 2000, the CDPHE received an Application for Reconsideration of Order for Civil Penalty, filed by project opponents, seeking to appeal the terms of the settlement. The application was denied by CDPHE. Project opponents have filed a judicial appeal in the District Court for Costilla County, Colorado, naming the CDPHE as defendant. Battle Mountain has intervened in the appeal to protect its interests in the settlement. The Company cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of this or any future action against Battle Mountain or the Company relating to this site. Guarantee of Third Party Indebtedness The Company guaranteed a former subsidiarys $35.7 million Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, due 2009. The former subsidiary is BHP Copper Inc., formerly known as Magma Copper Company. It is expected that the Company will be required to remain liable on this guarantee as long as the bonds remain outstanding; however, the Company has not been required to pay any of these amounts, nor does it expect to have to pay any in the future. Other Commitments and Contingencies In June 2000, a transport contractor of Minera Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles southwest of the mine. Mercury is a byproduct of 100 gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instrumentation and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Minera Yanacocha. In August 2000, Minera Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 soles (approximately US$500,000) to the Peruvian government. Minera Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. In addition, it has entered into agreements with three of the communities impacted by this incident to provide a variety of public works as compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident. On September 10, 2001, Minera Yanacocha, various wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, and other defendants were named in a lawsuit filed by over 900 Peruvian citizens in Denver District Court for the State of Colorado. This action seeks compensatory and punitive damages based on claims associated with the mercury spill incident. Estimated costs of $10 million for public works, remediation efforts, personal compensation and the fine were included in Other expense in 2000. Neither the Company nor Minera Yanacocha can reasonably predict the likelihood of any additional expenditures related to this matter. In a 1993 asset exchange, a wholly owned subsidiary transferred a coal lease under which the subsidiary had collected advance royalty payments totaling $484 million. From 1994 to 2018, remaining advance payments under the lease to the transferee total $390 million. In the event of title failure as stated in the lease, this subsidiary has a primary obligation to refund previously collected payments and has a secondary obligation to refund any of the $390 million collected by the transferee, if the transferee fails to meet its refund obligation. The subsidiary has no direct liability to the lessor and has title insurance on the leased coal deposits of $240 million covering the secondary obligation. The Company and the subsidiary regard the circumstances entitling the lessor to a refund as remote. The Company has agreed to maintain the subsidiarys net worth at $108 million until July 1, 2025. The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid as a minimum royalty (where production royalties are less than the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty requirements. At December 31, 2001, there were $131.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds primarily for bonding reclamation plans and reinsurance agreements. The surety bonds and letters of credit reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees competitively determined in the marketplace. NMC is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts which may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. NOTE 23 RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Prepaid Forward Sales Contract In October 2002, the Company determined that it needed to correct the accounting treatment for a prepaid forward gold sales contract (the Prepaid Forward) and a forward gold purchase contract (the Forward Purchase) entered into in July 1999. The Company concluded that these contracts did not meet the technical criteria to be accounted for in the manner reflected in the Companys historical consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Company has restated its consolidated financial statements beginning with the third quarter of 1999. 101 Under the Prepaid Forward, the Company agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces (the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company also agreed under the Prepaid Forward to deliver semi annually 17,951 ounces of gold, beginning June 2000 through June 2007 (the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements) for a total gold delivery obligation over the life of the Prepaid Forward of 752,598 ounces. At the time the Prepaid Forward was entered into, the Company received net proceeds of $137.2 million ($145.0 million of gross proceeds before transaction costs of $653,000 and the purchase of a $7.1 million surety bond to guarantee delivery of the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company may also be entitled to receive additional proceeds in the future in connection with the annual deliveries of 161,111 ounces, to be determined at each delivery date based on the excess, if any, of the then market price for gold (up to a maximum of $380 per ounce) over $300 per ounce. At the time the Company entered into the Prepaid Forward, it also entered into the Forward Purchase, with the same counterparty, to hedge the price risk with respect to the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements. The Forward Purchase provides for semi annual purchases of 17,951 ounces of gold on each semi annual delivery date under the Prepaid Forward at prices increasing from $263 per ounce in 2000 to $354 per ounce in 2007. On each semi annual delivery date, the ounces purchased under the Forward Purchase were delivered in satisfaction of the Companys delivery requirements under the Prepaid Forward. The Company previously accounted for these transactions by recording the net $137.2 million that it received under the Prepaid Forward as deferred revenue under the long term liabilities section of its balance sheet to be recognized incrementally as sales revenue when the 161,111 ounce annual gold deliveries were made in 2005, 2006 and 2007. On each semi annual delivery date, the cost of purchasing the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements under the Forward Purchase was deducted from sales revenue. No revenue, however, was recognized in respect of the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements that were delivered under the Prepaid Forward. The Forward Purchase was accounted for as a cash flow hedge with mark to market changes in its fair value recorded through Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As a result of this correction, the Company is accounting for the Prepaid Forward and the Forward Purchase as a single borrowing of $145.0 million in July 1999, with interest accrued, based on an effective interest rate recognized over the full term of the borrowing. The cost of the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements under the Forward Purchase will be treated as interest payments. As the Annual Delivery Requirements are made under the Prepaid Forward, the Company will recognize a corresponding amount of sales revenue. Any additional proceeds received in connection with the Annual Delivery Requirements will be reflected as additional revenue at the time such proceeds are received. The surety bond costs of $7.1 million associated with the Annual Delivery Requirements have been deferred and will be amortized during 2005, 2006 and 2007. As a result of this correction in accounting, the Companys net loss has increased by approximately $1.1 million or less than $0.01 per share, $1.3 million or $0.01 per share, and $3.6 million or $0.02 per share for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In addition to the above Other comprehensive income increased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Companys Stockholders equity as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 decreased by $3.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively. In addition, the Companys long term debt increased by $145.0 million ($137.2 million plus unamortized transaction and surety bond costs) at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, as a result of this correction. Investment in Batu Hijau In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that PTNNT, which owns the Batu Hijau mine, had incorrectly included non reserve material in its depreciation and deferred stripping calculations. NTP has restated its financial statements beginning with the fourth quarter of 1999 through the third quarter of 2002 so as to exclude material other than proven and probable reserves in its depreciation and deferred stripping calculations. As a result, the Company has restated its consolidated financial statements beginning with the fourth quarter of 1999. 102 The Company accounts for its 45% indirect interest in the Batu Hijau mine, which commenced production in late 1999, using the equity method. In accordance with operating and financing agreements relating to the mine, the Company recognizes 56.25% of the Batu Hijau mines net income until it has recouped the bulk of its construction investment. PTNNT mine had been including a certain amount of non reserve material in its depreciation and deferred stripping calculations. This material is located within the current economic pit design and is included in the Batu Hijau operations mining plan. However, due to a lack of drilling density in the areas of the pit where this material is located, this material does not currently meet the criteria to be classified as proven and probable reserves. PTNNT has recalculated depreciation and deferred stripping charges excluding this non reserve material. As a result of the correction in accounting for depreciation, the Companys net loss has increased by approximately $3.2 million or $0.02 per share, $2.9 million or $0.01 per share and decreased by $0.3 million or less than $0.01 per share for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded a consolidated tax benefit of $1.6 million related to the $4.4 million reduction in Batu Hijaus equity income resulting from the depreciation restatements. The Companys Stockholders equity as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 has decreased by $5.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively. As a result of the correction in accounting for deferred stripping, the Companys net loss has increased by approximately $2.3 million or less than $0.01 per share, $2.3 million or $0.01 per share and $0.4 million or less than $0.01 per share for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded a consolidated tax benefit of $1.3 million related to the $3.6 million reduction in Batu Hijaus equity income resulting from the deferred shipping restatement. The Companys Stockholders equity as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 has decreased by $5.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Depreciation Rates In November 2002, the Company determined that it had incorrectly recorded depreciation on certain mining assets at its Yanacocha operations in Peru. The Company has restated its consolidated financial statements beginning with the first quarter of 1999. As a result of this correction in accounting, the Companys net loss has been increased by approximately $3.3 million or $0.02 per share and $1.6 million or $0.01 per share for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and the net loss has been reduced by $1.6 million or $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 1999. The adjustments also increased the earnings of years prior to 1999 by $4.1 million and therefore increased Stockholders equity of the Company by $0.8 million and $4.2 million at December 31, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Inventory During the fourth quarter of 2002, Newmont determined that it had incorrectly excluded depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) from capitalized costs in inventories. The Company has therefore restated its consolidated financial statements to include DD&A associated with the production of inventories as a cost subject to capitalization. Previously, the Company had recorded all DD&A as a period expense. In addition, the Company changed from recognizing units of production (UOP) depletion and amortization based on the volume of gold ounces sold to recognizing UOP depletion and amortization based on estimated recoverable ounces mined or produced from proven and probable reserves at certain locations to accommodate the capitalization of DD&A in inventory. The Company continues to value its inventory at the lower of cost or market. As a result of the accounting change to capitalize DDA in inventory, the Company evaluated the revised inventory carrying costs at least quarterly and determined that write downs to market were required in each reporting period. The Company reports lower of cost or market inventory adjustments in Write down of assets in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2002, PTNNT determined that it had incorrectly excluded depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) from capitalized costs in inventories. PTNNT has therefore restated its 103 consolidated financial statements to include DD&A associated with the production of inventories as a cost subject to capitalization. Previously, PTNNT had recorded all DD&A as a period expense. In addition, the Company changed from recognizing units of production (UOP) depletion and amortization based on the volume of copper equivalent pounds sold to recognizing UOP depletion and amortization based on estimated copper equivalent recoverable pounds mined or produced from proven and probable reserves to accommodate the capitalization of DD&A in inventory. As a result of this correction, the Companys net loss was increased by $13.5 million or $0.07 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2001, net loss was decreased by $13.3 million or $0.06 per share for the year ended December 31, 2000 and net loss was increased by $15.1 million or $0.08 per share for the year ended December 31, 1999. The adjustments also increased the earnings of years prior to 1999 by $48.5 million and therefore increased Stockholders equity of the Company by $33.2 million and $46.8 million at December 31, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Reclassifications Certain amounts in previously reported consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Restated Consolidated Financial Statements The following sets forth the effects of the restatements to Newmonts Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the Statements of Cash Flow for years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, and the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2001 and 2000. 104 NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION RESTATEMENT OF STATEMENT OF

The exchangeable shares are substantially equivalent to Newmont common shares. On February 20, 2002, Newmont obtained control of Normandy through a tender offer for all of the ordinary shares in the capital of Normandy. For accounting purposes, the effective date of the Normandy acquisition was the close of business on February 15, 2002, when Newmont received the irrevocable tender from shareholders for more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Normandy. Accordingly, the results of operations of Normandy and Franco Nevada have been included in the accompanying financial statements from February 16, 2002 forward. On February 26, 2002, when the tender offer for Normandy expired, Newmont controlled more than 96% of Normandys outstanding shares. Newmont exercised its rights to acquire the remaining shares of Normandy in April 2002. Consideration paid for Normandy included 3.85 shares of Newmont common stock for every 100 ordinary shares of Normandy (including ordinary shares represented by American depository receipts) plus A$0.50 per Normandy share, or the U.S. dollar equivalent of that amount for Normandy stockholders outside Australia. Normandy was Australias largest gold company with interests in 16 development stage or operating mining properties worldwide. Franco Nevada was the worlds leading precious minerals royalty company and had interests in other investments in the Mining Industry. Following the February 2002 acquisitions, Normandy was renamed Newmont Australia Limited and Franco Nevada was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited. The purchase price for these acquisitions totaled $4.3 billion, composed of 197.4 million Newmont shares (or share equivalents), $462.1 million in cash and approximately $90 million of direct costs. The value of Newmont shares (or share equivalents) was $19.01 per share based on the average market price of the shares over the two day period before and after January 2, 2002, the last trading day before the final and revised terms for the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions were announced. The combination of Newmont, Normandy and Franco Nevada was designed to create a platform for rational growth and for delivering superior returns to shareholders. With a larger global operating base, a broad and balanced portfolio of development projects and a stable income stream from mineral royalties and investments, the combined company will have opportunities to optimize returns, realize synergies through rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration programs, realize operating efficiencies, reduce operating and procurement costs and reduce interest expense and income taxes. The acquisitions resulted in approximately $3.0 billion of goodwill primarily related to the Merchant Banking business, the combined global exploration expertise and the synergies discussed above. 114 The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair market values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over such fair value was recorded as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill was assigned to specific reporting units. Goodwill and other identifiable intangibles not subject to amortization will be reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently when an event or change in circumstances indicates that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. The following reflects the preliminary purchase allocation for the acquisition of 100% of Normandy (in millions, except per share data; unaudited): Shares of NMC common stock issued to Normandy stockholders, including shares attributable to Franco Nevadas 19.8% investment in Normandy 86.5 Value of NMC stock per share $ 19.01 Fair value of NMC common stock issued $ 1,644.2 Plus Cash consideration of A$0.50 per share 461.7 Plus Fair value of Normandy stock options cancelled by Newmont 5.9 Plus Estimated direct acquisition costs incurred by Newmont 61.3 Total Purchase Price 2,173.1 Plus Fair value of liabilities assumed by Newmont: Current liabilities, excluding accrued acquisition costs and settlement of stockoptions 191.6 Long term debt, including current portion 913.7 Derivative instrument liabilities 422.8 Other long term liabilities 465.8 Minority interests acquired 33.8 Less Fair value of assets acquired by Newmont: Current assets (350.0 ) Property, plant and equipment (493.1 ) Intangible Assets Proven and probable reserves (433.2 ) Undeveloped mineral interests (589.3 ) Other intangible assets (12.9 ) Equity investments in mining operations (222.1 ) Other long term assets (205.9 ) Residual purchase price allocated to goodwill $ 1,894.3 115 The following table reflects the preliminary purchase allocation for the acquisition of Franco Nevada (in millions, except per share data; unaudited): Shares of NMC common stock (or equivalents) issued to Franco Nevada stockholders, excluding shares attributable to Franco Nevadas 19.8% investment in Normandy 110.6 Value of NMC stock per share $ 19.01 Fair value of NMC common stock issued $ 2,101.6 Plus Fair value of Franco Nevada options assumed by Newmont 30.3 Plus Fair value of Franco Nevada warrants assumed by Newmont 13.3 Plus Estimated direct acquisition costs incurred by Newmont 29.0 Total Purchase Price 2,174.2 Plus Fair value of liabilities assumed by Newmont: Current liabilities, excluding accrual of acquisition costs 16.5 Other liabilities 222.7 Less Fair value of assets acquired by Newmont: Current assets (704.3 ) Intangible assets fair value of mining royalty properties (351.4 ) Fair value of investments in affiliated companies (excluding the 19.8% interest in Normandy) (227.4 ) Residual purchase price allocated to goodwill $ 1,130.3 The purchase price allocation is preliminary but has been modified during the fourth quarter of 2002. The allocation was modified with assistance from independent appraisers and resulted in recording the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Normandy and Franco Nevada at fair market value. Significant elements of the modified Normandy allocation are as follows: (i) property, plant and equipment was adjusted to estimated fair value based on the quantity of proven and probable reserves and undeveloped mineral interests at each site and the estimated future production costs and capital expenditures required to produce the reserve material and the replacement cost of land, buildings and equipment; and, (ii) other long term liabilities have been adjusted to the fair value of reclamation and remediation liabilities. Undeveloped mineral interests include: (i) Other mineralized material includes primarily inferred material within pits; measured, indicated and inferred material with insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable reserves and inferred material in close proximity to proven and probable reserves; (ii) Around mine exploration potential includes primarily inferred material not immediately adjacent to existing reserves and mineralization but located within the immediate mine infrastructure; and (iii) Other exploration potential is not part of measured, indicated or inferred material and is comprised primarily of material outside of the immediate mine area. Proven and probable reserves, other mineralized material and around mine exploration potential have been valued based on estimated discounted cash flows from future production of each class of material. Other exploration potential has been valued based on recent market comparables for sales of similar properties. Proven and probable reserves will be amortized on a units of production basis over the respective mine lives. Other mineralized material, around mine exploration potential and other exploration potential will be amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, taking into account residual values. Significant elements in the modified Franco Nevada allocation are as follows: (i) mining royalty properties and other were adjusted to estimated fair value based on the expected returns on those royalties; and, (ii) investments in affiliated companies were adjusted for the estimated fair value of the investment in Echo Bay Mines. As part of the purchase of Normandy and Franco Nevada in 2002, Newmont acquired identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, of $12.7 million, primarily for an exploration statistical database. These intangible assets are not subject to amortization and will be tested for impairment at least annually. There were no other significant acquired intangible assets. The Company does not currently anticipate the goodwill related to these acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. 116 The allocation of goodwill arising from the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions to reporting units is preliminary but has been modified during the fourth quarter of 2002. Newmont has modified the allocation of goodwill with assistance from independent appraisers. The Company has allocated goodwill primarily to the Merchant Banking and Exploration reporting units based on the valuations of those businesses and to specific mine site reporting units based on the mine specific synergies arising from the combination of Newmont, Normandy and Franco Nevada that are expected to be realized in the future. Newmonts allocation of goodwill (see below) to the Merchant Banking reporting unit assumes the Company will continue to realize above average investment returns from various types of transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments in royalty interests and disposals of different interests in mining projects. The allocation of goodwill to the Companys Exploration reporting unit assumes above average investment returns from the exploration and development of additional proven and probable reserves. The allocation of goodwill to anticipated synergies at the Companys various mine site reporting units assumes such operational synergies will be realized. A change in these assumptions based on a change in local or global gold markets and conditions could trigger a future impairment of goodwill. The allocation of goodwill to reporting units is expected to be finalized by the end of 2002; therefore, the final allocation could differ from the preliminary allocation. The preliminary carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit as of December 31, 2002 is summarized in the following table (in millions, and unaudited): Nevada Other North America Total North America Yanacocha OtherSouth America Total South America Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 40.9 $ $ 40.9 $ $ $ Pajingo Other Australia Total Australia Zarafshan Newmont Other International Operations Total Gold Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 56.9 $ 140.8 $ 197.7 $ $ $ 238.6 Base Metals Exploration Merchant Banking Corporate andOther Consolidated Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 31.5 $ 1,144.2 $ 1,625.0 $ $ 3,039.3 Changes in Accounting Principle Depreciation, depletion and amortization During the third quarter of 2002, Newmont changed its accounting policy, retroactive to January 1, 2002, with respect to depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of Property, Plant and Mine Development to exclude future estimated development costs expected to be incurred for certain underground operations. Previously, the Company had included these costs and associated reserves in its DD&A calculations at certain of its underground mining operations. In addition, the Company further revised its policy such that costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are depreciated, depleted or amortized over the reserves associated with the specific ore area. These changes were made to better match DD&A with the associated ounces of gold sold and to remove the inherent uncertainty in estimating future development costs in arriving at DD&A rates. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle through December 31, 2001 increased net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2002 by $7.7 million, net of tax of $4.1 million and increased net income per share by $0.02 per share. The effect of the change was to reduce DD&A expense by $1.6 million and $2.4 million in the first and second quarters of 2002, respectively, and increase DD&A expense by $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2002. The effect of the change to net income was a decrease of the net loss of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2002, an increase in net income of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2002 and a decrease in net income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2002. 117 The table below presents the pro forma effects of the accounting change on Net loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle had it been in effect for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Years Ended (Increase)/decrease to Net loss (in millions) December 31, 2001 December 31, 2000 December 31, 1999 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization $ 2.0 $ 0.9 $ 1.6 Income tax expense (0.7 ) (0.3 ) (0.5 ) Net loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ 1.3 $ 0.6 $ 1.1 Net loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 The table below presents the pro forma Net loss applicable to common shares before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle giving effect to the change discussed above: Years Ended December 31, 2001 December 31, 2000 December 31, 1999 Pro forma net loss applicable to common shares before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ (52.8 ) $ (84.0 ) $ (118.2 ) Pro forma net loss applicable to common shares before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle per share, basic and diluted $ (0.27 ) $ (0.44 ) $ (0.62 ) Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and TVX Newmont Americas Newmont obtained a 48.8% interest in Echo Bay through its acquisition of Franco Nevada in February 2002. Franco Nevada purchased capital securities of Echo Bay with face value of $72.4 million in June 2001. In January 2002, $4.6 million of these capital securities were sold. Newmont acquired Franco Nevadas remaining holdings of Echo Bays capital securities in connection with Newmonts acquisition of Franco Nevada. Subsequent to this acquisition, an agreement was reached with Echo Bay and the capital securities holders to exchange the capital securities for common stock of Echo Bay. This exchange of capital securities debt obligations for common stock occurred on April 3, 2002 and resulted in Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation) owning 48.8% of Echo Bay common stock which decreased to 45.3% at September 30, 2002 as a result of equity issuances by Echo Bay. From April 3, 2002, Newmont has accounted for its investment in Echo Bay under the equity method. On January 31, 2003, Newmont sold its 49.9% interest in TVX Newmont Americas (a joint venture between the Company and TVX Gold Inc., acquired as part of the Normandy transaction) to TVX for $180 million in cash and recognized no significant gain or loss on the transaction. On January 31, 2003 the combination was announced of Kinross Gold Corporation (Kinross), TVX Gold Inc. (TVX) and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. Shareholders of Echo Bay and TVX will become common shareholders of Kinross based on the exchange ratios of 0.1733 and 2.1667, respectively. The combination of the three companies was effective February 3, 2003 and included the exchange of Newmonts interest in Echo Bay for an approximate interest of 13.8% in the new Kinross. Newmont expects to record a gain of approximately $90 million on the sale of Echo Bay. Australian Magnesium Corporation On January 3, 2003 Newmont contributed an additional A$100 million ($US 55.9 million) to AMC pursuant to its obligation under the original investment in return for approximately 167 million additional shares, 118 increasing our ownership percentage to 40.9%. However, due to the conversion by a third party shareholder of preferred shares to voting, common shares, our interest was decreased to 27.8%. In addition, subsequent to year end the A$90 million (approximately $49 million) contingent equity commitment outlined in Note 7 was negotiated into an A$75 million (approximately $41 million) contingent convertible debt and equity facility. Sale of Lihir A gain on the sale of marketable securities of $47.3 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2002 when Newmont sold its 9.7% equity holding in Lihir Gold Limited. As a result, Newmont is no longer a shareholder of Lihir. Newmont realized proceeds of $84.0 million on the sale and recognized a pre tax gain of $47 million on the transaction. NOTE 25 UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Deferred Stripping In general, mining costs are charged to Costs applicable to sales as incurred. However, at open pit mines, which have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios over the mine life, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units of production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios; however industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Companys operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold with an equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there may be greater volatility in the Companys period to period results of operations. See additional discussion of deferred stripping in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Details of deferred stripping with respect to certain of the Companys open pit mines are as follows (unaudited): Nevada(3) Mesquite(4) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 138.4 145.1 161.4 237.6 120.7 190.7 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.066 0.066 0.063 0.023 0.018 0.020 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 88.9 106.6 162.2 155.5 180.4 134.2 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.060 0.060 0.057 0.031 0.016 0.017 Remaining Mine Life (years) 9 10 11 1 2 119 Minahasa(5) La Herradura(6) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 14.5 19.8 24.0 177.0 144.4 172.6 Grade of ore (ounces of gold per ton) 0.172 0.195 0.158 0.035 0.032 0.034 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 15.9 16.4 22.4 200.0 228.4 201.7 Grade of ore (ounces of gold per ton) 0.131 0.205 0.326 0.025 0.024 0.023 Remaining Mine Life (years) 1 2 6 7 8 (1) Total tons to be mined in future divided by total ounces of gold to be recovered in future, based on proven and probable reserves. (2) Total tons mined divided by total ounces of gold recovered. (3) The life of mine stripping ratio decreased during 2000 and 2001 from 1999 reflecting the deferral of open pit projects in response to lower gold prices. The actual stripping ratio during 2000 and 2001 decreased from 1999 as a result of entering into higher grade ore zones in the Twin Creeks pit. (4) The life of mine stripping ratio decreased in 2000 from 1999 and increased in 2001 versus 2000 reflecting significant changes to the mine plan in the final three years of operations. The actual stripping ratio was higher during 2000 in comparison to 1999 as a result of clearing additional waste material to access an ore zone. (5) The actual and life of mine stripping ratios decreased during 2000 and 2001 from 1999 reflecting higher grade ore zones at the bottom of the Mesel pit as mining concluded in the fourth quarter of 2001. (6) The increase in the life of mine stripping ratio in 2001 versus 2000 is due to an increase in proven and probable reserves, which resulted in a change in the pit design.

(3) In the quarter ended December 31, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition, as described in Note 19. The accounting principle was applied retroactively to January 1, 2000, and 2000 quarterly information was restated. (4) Included an after tax charge of $0.4 million, none, $1.4 million and $1.3 million in the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, respectively, for expenses related to the change in accounting principle and an after tax impairment charge of $21.3 million, in the quarter ended December 31. Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges The ratio of earnings to fixed charges represents income before income taxes and interest expense divided by interest expense. Interest expense includes amortization of capitalized interest and the portion of rent expense representative of interest. The Company guarantees certain third party debt; however, it has not been and does not expect to be required to pay any amounts associated with such debt. Therefore, related interest on such debt has not been included in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. ITEM 7A.
