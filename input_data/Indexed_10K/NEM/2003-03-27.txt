Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis), the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 1998 and as of December 31, 1999 are derived from unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont or the Company). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. References to A$ refer to Australian currency, CDN$ to Canadian currency and US$ or $ to United States Currency. Accounting Changes During the third quarter of 2002, Newmont changed its accounting policy, retroactive to January 1, 2002, with respect to depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of Property, Plant and Equipment to exclude future estimated development costs expected to be incurred for certain underground operations. Previously, the Company had included these costs and associated reserves in its DD&A calculations at certain of its underground mining operations. In addition, the Company further revised its policy such that costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are depreciated, depleted or amortized over the reserves associated with the specific ore area. These changes were made to better match DD&A with the associated ounces of gold sold and to remove the inherent uncertainty in estimating future development costs in arriving at DD&A rates. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle through December 31, 2001 increased net income during the year ended December 31, 2002 by $7.7 million, net of tax of $4.1 million, and increased net income per share by $0.02. The effect of the change in 2002 was to increase DD&A expense by $1.3 million and decrease net income by $0.8 million for the year. If the change had been in effect for 2001 and 2000, the pro forma effect of the change would have reduced DD&A expense by $2.0 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and would have decreased the net loss by $1.3 million and $0.6 million for the same periods. There was no pro forma impact to earnings per share in either 2001 or 2000. Restructuring On February 13, 2002, Newmont stockholders approved adoption of an Agreement and Plan of Merger that provided for a restructuring of Newmont to facilitate the February 2002 acquisitions described below and to create a flexible corporate structure. Newmont merged with an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary that resulted in Newmont (or Old Newmont) becoming a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed holding company. The new holding company, previously a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Newmont, was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Newmont as a result of this restructuring and former stockholders of Old Newmont became stockholders of the new holding company. Old Newmont was subsequently renamed Newmont USA Limited. Mergers and Acquisitions Normandy Mining Limited and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited On February 16, 2002, pursuant to a Canadian Plan of Arrangement, Newmont acquired 100% of Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited (Franco Nevada) in a stock for stock transaction in which Franco Nevada common stockholders received 0.8 of a share of Newmont common stock, or 0.8 of a Canadian exchangeable share (exchangeable for Newmont common), for each common share of Franco Nevada. The exchangeable shares are substantially equivalent to Newmont common shares. On February 20, 2002, Newmont obtained control of Normandy Mining Limited (Normandy) through a tender offer for all of the ordinary shares of Normandy. For accounting purposes, the effective date of the Normandy acquisition was the close of business on February 15, 2002, when Newmont received an irrevocable tender from shareholders for more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Normandy. Accordingly, the results of operations of Normandy and Franco Nevada have been included in the accompanying financial statements from February 16, 2002 forward. On February 26, 2002, 48 Table of Contents when the tender offer for Normandy expired, Newmont controlled more than 96% of Normandys outstanding shares. Newmont exercised its rights to acquire the remaining shares of Normandy in April 2002. Consideration paid for Normandy included 3.85 shares of Newmont common stock for every 100 ordinary shares of Normandy (including ordinary shares represented by American depository receipts) plus A$0.50 per Normandy share, or the U.S. dollar equivalent of that amount for Normandy stockholders outside Australia. Normandy was Australias largest gold company with interests in 16 development stage or operating mining properties worldwide. Franco Nevada was the worlds leading precious minerals royalty company and had interests in other investments in the mining industry. Following the February 2002 acquisitions, Normandy was renamed Newmont Australia Limited (NAL) and Franco Nevada was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited. The purchase price for these acquisitions totaled $4.3 billion, composed of 197.0 million Newmont shares (or share equivalents), $461.7 million in cash and approximately $90.3 million of direct costs. The value of Newmont shares (or share equivalents) was $19.01 per share based on the average market price of the shares over the two day period before and after January 2, 2002, the last trading day before the final and revised terms for the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions were announced. The combination of Newmont, Normandy and Franco Nevada was designed to create a platform for growth and for delivering superior returns to shareholders. With a larger global operating base, a broad and balanced portfolio of development projects and a stable income stream from mineral royalties and investments, the combined company will have opportunities to optimize returns, realize synergies through rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration programs, realize operating efficiencies, reduce operating and procurement costs and reduce interest expense and income taxes. The acquisitions resulted in approximately $3.0 billion of goodwill primarily related to the merchant banking business, the combined global exploration programs and expertise, and the synergies discussed above. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair market values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over such fair value was recorded as goodwill. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill was assigned to specific reporting units. Goodwill and other identifiable intangibles not subject to amortization will be reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently when an event or change in circumstances indicates that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. In conjunction with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2002, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation for the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions. The final purchase price allocation resulted in an increase in goodwill from approximately $2.6 billion to approximately $3.0 billion. We anticipate synergies from our business combination with Normandy and Franco Nevada to exceed $75 million annually starting in 2003. Such synergies are being and will be obtained from the rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration and development budgets, as well as operating efficiencies and cost reductions associated with procurement, interest and tax benefits. Battle Mountain Gold Company On January 10, 2001, Newmont completed a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company (Battle Mountain) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated June 21, 2000, under which each share of common stock of Battle Mountain and each exchangeable share of Battle Mountain Canada Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Battle Mountain) was converted into the right to receive 0.105 share of Newmont, or approximately 24.1 million shares. Newmont also exchanged 2.3 million shares of newly issued $3.25 convertible preferred stock for all outstanding shares of Battle Mountain $3.25 convertible preferred stock. The 49 Table of Contents merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and as such, the Consolidated Financial Statements include Battle Mountains financial data as if Battle Mountain had always been part of Newmont. During 2001, Newmont successfully integrated the former Battle Mountain operations in Canada and Bolivia, the Phoenix development project in Nevada, and its interest in the Pajingo joint venture operation in Australia. Synergies in excess of the estimated $25 million, pre tax, were achieved during 2001 from consolidation of administrative and exploration staffs, purchasing economies and application of Gold Medal Performance, Newmonts internal process improvement program. The Phoenix project will provide an opportunity for additional synergies in future years from utilization of existing nearby processing facilities. Summary Newmont recorded net income to common shares of $154.3 million ($0.42 per share, basic) for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with net losses to common shares of $54.1 million ($0.28 per share) and $97.2 million ($0.51 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Results for 2002 included, after tax, a non cash unrealized mark to market loss on derivatives of $38.3 million ($0.10 per share), a $30.7 million ($0.08 per share) gain on the sale of marketable securities of Lihir, $31.3 million ($0.08 per share) for asset write downs, $10.2 million ($0.03 per share) for prior period income tax benefits and a $7.7 million ($0.02 per share) gain for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results for 2001 included after tax, $43.7 million ($0.22 per share) for restructuring and Battle Mountain merger expenses, $37.6 million ($0.19 per share) for asset write downs, $24.8 million ($0.13 per share) for prior period income tax benefits, $3.3 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses and $1.1 million for a gain on written call options. Results in 2000 included after tax, non cash charges of $49.3 million ($0.26 per share) for asset write downs, $27.4 million ($0.14 per share) for expenses associated with an acquisition settlement, $23.9 million ($0.12 per share) for losses on marketable securities, a $12.6 million ($0.06 per share) loss for the cumulative effect of accounting changes for revenue recognition, $12.4 million ($0.06 per share) for amortization of put option premiums and $4.0 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses. Also included were after tax charges of $6.9 million ($0.04 per share) for merger expenses and a non cash unrealized mark to market gain on call option contracts of $17.4 million ($0.09 per share). As a largely unhedged company, Newmonts average realized gold price of $313, $271 and $282 per equity ounce sold in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, closely tracked the spot market price. At December 31, 2002, approximately 10.3% of Newmonts proven and probable reserves were subject to derivative contracts. At December 31, 2001, less than 4% of Newmonts proven and probable reserves were subject to derivative contracts. In 2002, gold sales increased to 7.63 million equity ounces (ounces attributable to Newmonts ownership or economic interest), compared to 5.47 million and 5.76 million equity ounces in 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily from additional production from the operations acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition. Total cash costs of production were $189 per ounce in 2002, $184 per ounce in 2001 and $170 per ounce in 2000. As a result of increased production and higher average realized gold prices, cash flow from operations increased to $670.3 million in 2002 from $369.7 million in 2001 and $534.3 million in 2000. Long term debt, net of cash balances, was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2002 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001. Gold reserves at December 31, 2002 totaled 86.9 contained equity ounces (including Newmonts then equity interest in TVX Newmont Americas and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. (Echo Bay)) compared with 87.3 million ounces at December 31, 2001 on a pro forma basis including the reserves of Normandy. Reserve calculations for 2002 and 2001 were based on a gold price assumption of $300 per ounce. Newmonts reserves, excluding the reserves of the TVX Newmont Americas and Echo Bay that were sold in early 2003, would decline 50 Table of Contents to 74.8 million ounces at December 31, 2002 based on a gold price assumption of $275 per ounce and would increase to 89.3 million ounces with a price assumption of $325 per ounce. In 2002, copper sales totaled 408.0 million equity pounds (pounds attributable to Newmonts economic interest), compared with 360.0 million and 294.2 million equity pounds in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs were $0.34, $0.37 and $0.59 per equity pound, after gold and silver sales credits, for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The average realized price in 2002 was $0.73 per pound, compared with $0.70 and $0.82 per pound in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Proven and probable reserves totaled 7.6 billion contained equity pounds of copper at December 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of Newmonts Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most critical accounting principles upon which Newmonts financial status depends are those requiring estimates of proven and probable reserves, recoverable ounces therefrom, and or assumptions of future gold prices. Such estimates and assumptions affect the value of inventories (which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value), the potential impairment of long lived assets, and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. Other significant assumptions that affect the Companys estimates regarding impairments of long lived assets and the realizable amounts of deferred tax assets are estimated future production costs and capital expenditures. Estimates of proven and probable reserves, as well as estimates of the useful lives of buildings and equipment, also affect the rate at which depreciation, depletion and amortization are charged to earnings. In addition, management has estimated future costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as remediation costs for inactive properties. The Companys portfolio of derivatives includes complex gold and other instruments. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair values of such instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding gold and other commodity prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates. Management also applies considerable judgment to determining whether losses from environmental, legal and other contingencies are probable, and if so, how much to accrue for each contingency. Management engaged independent appraisers to assist in the allocation of the purchase price of Normandy and Franco Nevada to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their fair values; the determination of such fair values were dependent upon assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows from each acquired mining operation and other factors, including the Companys ability and intent to renew mining leases where the remaining term on the current lease is not sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and probable reserves and undeveloped mineral interests. Furthermore, the Company allocated the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets (i.e. goodwill) to reporting units based upon independent appraisals. This allocation was primarily based upon assumptions regarding the ability of Normandys exploration program to continue to make discoveries consistent with historical results, the ability of Newmont Capital to continue to engage in mergers, acquisitions and other deals to enhance shareholder value consistent with historical results and the ability of the Company to realize certain synergies at specific mining operations. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations Equity Ozs.

Certain gold mines produce silver as a by product. Proceeds from the sale of by products are reflected as credits to total cash costs. All of these charges and by product credits are included in Costs applicable to sales. Charges for reclamation are also included in Costs applicable to sales, but are not included in total cash costs. Reclamation charges are included in total production costs, together with total cash costs and Depreciation, depletion and amortization. A reconciliation of total cash costs to Costs applicable to sales in total and by segment is provided in Item 2, Properties, Operating Statistics on page 30. Total production costs provide an indication of earnings before interest expense and taxes for Newmonts share of gold 52 Table of Contents mining properties, when taking into account the average realized price received for gold sold, as this measure combines Costs applicable to sales plus Depreciation, depletion and amortization, net of minority interest. Disclosure of total cash costs per ounce is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities of these mining operations. Newmonts management uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its gold mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. This measure was developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmonts measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See the reconciliation of Costs applicable to sales to total cash costs and total production costs per ounce (unaudited) on page 30. North American Operations Newmonts Nevada operations are along the Carlin Trend near Elko and in the Winnemucca region, where the Twin Creeks mine and the Lone Tree Complex are located. Nevada operations also include the Midas underground mine (acquired in February 2002). Nevadas gold sales in 2002 of 2.72 million ounces were 1% higher than in 2001. Total cash costs at Nevada also increased slightly from $222 per ounce in 2001 to $225 per ounce in 2002. The Midas mine, acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition, contributed approximately 196,200 ounces of production in 2002, or approximately 7% of Nevadas production. Without the Midas production, Nevada gold sales would have declined about 6.5% in 2002 compared to 2001. This resulted from (i) less oxide mill throughput in 2002 due to the shutdown of the Pinon Mill; (ii) utilization of lower grade oxide stockpiles resulting in lower recoveries in most oxide mills; and (iii) a 38.5% decline in tons placed on the leach pads due to mining more mill grade material and the postponement of production from Gold Quarry South Layback project until 2003. These trends were largely offset by increased throughput in the refractory mills from better utilization of the Carlin Roaster and the Twin Creeks Sage Mill and a 3% increase in refractory grade. Nevadas sales of 2.7 million ounces in 2001 were 11% lower than in 2000, with the depletion of the Deep Post surface deposit early in 2001 resulting in approximately 300,000 fewer high grade, low cost open pit ounces produced during 2001 than during 2000. This also caused total cash costs to increase to $222 per ounce in 2001 from $203 per ounce in 2000. Approximately 139 million tons of material were mined from surface open pits in 2001, down 31% from 2000. Refractory ore treatment facilities, with higher processing costs than oxide ore mills, generated 65% of Nevadas production in 2001, as compared to 68% in 2000. Sales and total cash costs in 2003 are expected to be 2.55 million ounces and $215 per ounce, respectively. The projected 6% decline in production in 2003 is due to expected lower recovery from the Carlin Roaster as a result of expected drawdowns of lower grade stockpiles and increased stripping at Twin Creeks. Total cash costs at Nevada are expected to decline by $10 per ounce partially reflecting reduced royalties due to a full year of benefit from acquiring the Nevada royalties formerly held by Franco Nevada and increased silver by product credits. Gold sales at the Mesquite heap leach mine in southern California decreased 38% to 57,100 ounces in 2002, and total cash costs per ounce decreased to $177 in 2002 from $205 in 2001, reflecting the full impact of the cessation of mining activities and the depletion of the ore body in 2001. Gold sales fell 29% to 92,600 ounces in 2001 from 130,300 ounces in 2000. Total cash costs per ounce also decreased 7% to $205 per ounce in 2001 from $221 per ounce in 2000. Mining activities ceased in the second quarter of 2001 with the depletion of the ore body, and selected equipment from the Mesquite mine was transferred to operations in South America and in Nevada. Gold sales from continued declining recovery of gold from heap leach pads of about 35,000 ounces at $160 total cash costs per ounce are expected in 2003. Final gold production from inventories on the leach pads is expected in 2004. At La Herradura, a 44% owned, heap leach operation in Sonora, Mexico not operated by the Company, Newmonts equity share of 2002 sales totaled 64,200 ounces at a total cash cost of $176 per ounce, compared to 54,700 ounces at $173 per ounce in 2001 and 50,500 ounces at $131 per ounce in 2000. Gold sales in 2003 are expected to total approximately 75,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $157 per ounce. 53 Table of Contents Production sold from the Golden Giant underground mine in Ontario, Canada amounted to 281,500 ounces at total cash costs of $196 per ounce in 2002, compared to 283,700 ounces at $187 and 406,600 ounces at $146 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Despite similar sales volumes in 2002 compared to 2001, total cash costs per ounce increased in 2002 reflecting increased electricity rates, mining costs expensed for ongoing development, increased ground support and maintenance costs and appreciation of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Ounces sold decreased and total cash costs per ounce increased from 2000 to 2001 primarily due to lower grade ore. This maturing mine is projected to experience diminishing mining fronts, smaller size stopes, increasing stopes being mined simultaneously and more labor intensive mining techniques in 2003, leading to projected gold ounces sold of approximately 200,000 ounces at $252 total cash costs per ounce. The Holloway underground mine in Ontario, Canada is an 84.65% owned joint venture with Teddy Bear Valley Mines. In 2002, gold sales totaled 97,700 equity ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $204, compared to 89,400 ounces at a total cash cost of $209 in 2001 and 83,400 ounces at $229 per ounce in 2000. The upward trend in ounces sold from 2000 to 2002 primarily reflects increasing mill throughput in each year from surface secondary crushing and drawdowns of inventories in 2002. The decrease in cash costs in 2002 is primarily from increased production. Holloway is expected to sell approximately 75,000 equity ounces at $255 total cash costs per ounce in 2003. The expected decrease in ounces sold and increase in cash costs per ounce in 2003 result from production of lower grade ore due to stope sequencing and depleted in process inventories. South American Operations Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (Yanacocha) in Peru is 51.35% owned and includes five open pit mines, four leach pads, two gold recovery plants and a crushing and agglomeration facility. Gold sales were a record 2.29 million ounces (1.18 million equity ounces) in 2002, 20% higher than 2001. Total cash costs per ounce of $125 were up 9% from 2001 primarily due to lower grade ore and more production coming from the higher cost La Quinua operation that requires crushing and agglomeration unlike other Minera Yanacocha ore bodies, partially offset by economies of scale resulting from higher production levels. In 2001, Yanacocha achieved sales of 1.91 million ounces (983,100 equity ounces), a 9% increase from 1.76 million ounces (901,200 equity ounces) in 2000. Total cash costs of $115 per ounce in 2001 were lower than 2002 because of low waste to ore ratios and porous ore that yielded high gold recoveries without crushing prior to heap leaching. Total cash costs of $87 per ounce in 2000 resulted primarily from waste to ore ratios lower than 2001 and slightly higher grade ore. Production at Yanacocha has grown annually through the discovery and development of additional reserves and increased mining and processing capacity. Without adding new mining equipment, Yanacocha reached a mining rate of 600,000 tons per day in the fourth quarter of 2002. Yanacocha mined approximately 204 million tons of material (149 million ore tons and 55 million waste tons) in 2002, compared to approximately 156 million tons (85 million ore tons and 71 million waste tons) in 2001 and 132 million tons (83 million ore tons and 49 million waste tons) in 2000. Yanacochas first crushing and agglomeration facility, for the La Quinua deposit, started up late in the third quarter of 2001 and continued to undergo commissioning adjustments through the first half of 2002, gradually stepping up to its design rate of 132,000 tons per day (120,000 metric tons per day). Yanacocha is expected to sell approximately 2.5 million ounces (1.3 million equity ounces) of gold in 2003 at total cash costs per ounce of $115 to $120. The Kori Kollo open pit mine in Bolivia is owned by Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., in which Newmont has an 88% interest. Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado owns the remaining 12% interest. Equity gold ounces sold in 2002 totaled 249,400 ounces, compared to 274,800 and 247,700 equity ounces in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce were $156 in 2002, compared to $158 and $200 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Production declined in 2002 primarily from processing lower grade ore through the mill. Production increased and cash costs per ounce decreased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the introduction of a new heap leach operation and improved mill performance. Equity ounces sold in 2003 are expected to total approximately 125,000 ounces at total cash costs of $240 per ounce. Kori Kollo is a mature mine. The pit will be mined out in the first half of 2003 with closure of the mill later in the year. Leach production will continue thereafter until the oxide ore stockpiles are depleted. 54 Table of Contents Australian Operations Information related to Australian operations for 2002 reflects activity from February 16, 2002 (as the Normandy acquisition was effective February 15, 2002) through December 31, 2002, with the exception of Pajingo, which was 50% owned by Newmont prior to the acquisition of Normandy. For 2002, equity gold sales at the 50% owned Kalgoorlie mine in Western Australia totaled 324,700 ounces at total cash costs of $215 per ounce. Cash costs per ounce for 2002 were higher than anticipated due to continued mining at Mt. Charlotte, an underground mine just north of the Super Pit, and higher milling costs resulting from the treatment of lower grade material. For 2003, gold sales at Kalgoorlie are expected to total 340,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost per ounce of $275. Equity ounces sold are expected to increase in 2003 because Newmont will own its interest for the full year 2003, compared to 10.5 months in 2002, partially offset by reduced throughput and lower recoveries. Cash costs per ounce are expected to rise in 2003 due to the lower production and an increase in the A$ exchange rate. The joint venture owners have commissioned a program that is currently evaluating operating initiatives to improve Kalgoorlies cost structure. At the Yandal operations, which consist of the Bronzewing, Jundee and Wiluna mines in Western Australia, gold sales for 2002 were 611,100 equity ounces at total cash costs of $215 per ounce. A shortfall of ounces sold at Bronzewing occurred in 2002 due to a 14% lower than expected mill feed grade, lower than budgeted tons milled and a shortfall in underground ore production. Bronzewing cash costs were higher than budgeted due primarily to higher mining costs from the one time cost of transitioning to owner mining during the period. Gold sales at the Jundee property were below budget due to lower production, a result of mining in lower grade underground stopes in the third quarter and increased quantities of lower grade regional ore processed throughout the year. Cash costs per ounce at Jundee were consistent with the Companys expectations, with the effects of lower production being offset by lower operating costs due to lower mining volumes and underground development achieved by the new mining contractor. An agreement for the sale of Wiluna was signed during the year, which has since expired. The existing Wiluna reserves are expected to be depleted within one year. Yandal gold sales in 2003 are expected to total 640,000 equity ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $257 per ounce. Equity ounces sold are expected to increase in 2003 due to the Yandal operations being accounted for over a full year, partially offset by a reduction in head grade at Jundee due to the blending of low grade stockpiles during the year, and 10% lower than anticipated throughput at Bronzewing as current reserves are depleted pending mine closure in early 2004. Cash costs per ounce are projected to rise in 2003 as a direct result of the expected lower production, a higher A$ exchange rate and a higher allocation of corporate costs. Newmont Yandal Operations Limited (NYOL), the Newmont subsidiary that owns the Yandal operations, has a substantial derivatives position. At December 31, 2002, NYOLs hedge positions had a mark to market valuation of negative $288 million. A number of NYOLs hedge positions are governed by agreements that confer on the relevant counterparties a right to terminate the position prior to its agreed scheduled maturity date. Such a termination would require an immediate cash settlement of that contract based on the market value on the date of termination and could result in a cash settlement obligation to NYOL hedge counterparties in excess of available funds. NYOL also has outstanding $300 million (of which Newmont owns $62.8 million) of ten year 8 7/8% senior unsecured notes due in 2008. NYOLs liabilities represent a significant challenge to NYOL, and while these liabilities are non recourse to Newmont and its other subsidiaries, should NYOL become bankrupt or insolvent, there could be loss or liquidation of NYOLs assets including the Bronzewing, Jundee and Wiluna mines, which had proven and probable reserves of 2.1 million ounces as of December 31, 2002. Newmont controls a significant land position through its control of Newmont NFM (Normandy NFM Limited trading as Newmont NFM) and Otter Gold Mines Limited (Otter Mines) in the highly prospective Tanami gold district. For 2002, the Tanami operations in the Northern Territory (approximately an 85.9% interest) sold 452,400 equity ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $205. Equity gold sales at Tanami were higher than expected reflecting higher production due to higher than expected grades and recoveries, partially offset by lower mill throughput. Cash costs per ounce were higher than expected due to additional milling and maintenance costs resulting from abrasive ore from the Groundrush mine, partially offset by the impacts of 55 Table of Contents higher production. Tanami is expected to sell about 600,000 equity ounces in 2003 at total cash costs per ounce of $215. The increase in projected equity ounces sold is partially attributable to the plan to acquire the remaining minority interests in Newmont NFM (see Production Properties at page 21). The increase is also attributable to the mining of higher grade stopes at the Granites and additional recoveries and higher grades of ore mined at Groundrush, along with a full year contribution from Newmont NFM. Cash costs per ounce are expected to rise in 2003 due to deeper mining and additional crushing costs at Groundrush, partially offset by the impact of the higher production at the Granites. Cash costs are also expected to be impacted by a higher $A exchange rate and a higher allocation of corporate costs. At the Pajingo mine in north Queensland, gold sales for 2002 were 296,400 equity ounces at cash costs per ounce of $95, compared to 126,000 and 112,100 equity ounces at cash costs of $105 and $99 per ounce in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in ounces sold in 2002 is primarily from Newmonts interest in the operation increasing to 100% from 50% in prior years due to the acquisition of Normandy. Sales also increased from higher production due to higher grade ore in 2002. Cash costs per ounce declined in 2002 reflecting the impact of a full year of owner mining. Increased sales from 2000 and 1999 resulted from production increases due to the completion of a mill expansion project in 1999. Gold sales in 2003 are projected to total approximately 345,000 ounces with cash costs of $110 per ounce. The increase in gold sales at Pajingo is due to higher throughput and grades and the impact of having 100% ownership for most of the year. Cash costs are expected to increase due to the impact of a higher A$ exchange rate and a higher allocation of corporate costs. Other Mining Operations Information related to Martha, Ovacik, Golden Grove and TVX Newmont Americas for 2002 reflects activity from February 16, 2002 (as the Normandy acquisition was effective February 15, 2002) through December 31, 2002. Information related to Echo Bay for 2002 reflects activity from April 3, 2002 (the date Newmonts investment was converted from capital debt securities to common shares of Echo Bay) through December 31, 2002. Information for all other properties in 2002 reflects activity from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002. The Zarafshan Newmont Joint Venture, in the Central Asian Republic of Uzbekistan, is a 50/50 joint venture between Newmont and two Uzbekistan government entities, the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources (the State Committee) and Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combinat (Navoi). Gold sales in 2002 totaled 511,600 ounces (255,800 equity ounces) compared to 444,000 ounces (222,000 equity ounces) in 2001 and 502,800 ounces (251,400 equity ounces) in 2000. Gold sales increased in 2002 due to higher grade ore placed on the leach pads. Total cash costs of $134 per ounce in 2002 were consistent with the $136 per ounce in 2001. Total cash costs increased in 2001 from $129 per ounce in 2000. Zarafshan Newmont is expected to sell approximately 210,000 equity ounces in 2003 at cash costs per ounce of $152. Zarafshan Newmont produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low grade oxide ore from the nearby government owned Murantau mine. The State Committee and Navoi furnish ore to Zarafshan Newmont under an ore supply agreement. Under the agreement, the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to deliver 220 million metric tons of ore to Zarafshan Newmont. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 98.1 million metric tons of ore have been delivered, leaving a balance of 121.9 million metric tons. Initially, under the agreement, ore was to be delivered regardless of the gold price and the price of the ore was dependent on the grade of ore delivered. In 2000, however, the ore supply agreement was amended to modify the required grades and pricing structure. Under the 2000 amendment, the grade of ore that the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to provide is dependent on the forecasted gold price as determined by the board of directors of Zarafshan Newmont, and the price is dependent on the average gold price during the period the ore is processed. Thus at higher gold prices, the State Committee and Navoi may deliver lower grade ore, but receive a higher price. In October 2002, the parties reached tentative agreement to further amend the ore supply agreement. Under the new amendment, the pricing terms for approximately 99.5 million metric tons of the remaining 121.9 million metric tons will be determined by a formula whereby the amount paid for ore is 56 Table of Contents dependent on the average grade of ore and the average gold price during the period which the ore is processed. At certain combinations of ore grade and gold price, the computed price may result in a credit to Zarafshan Newmont which will be offset against future ore purchase payments or free cash flow distributions to Navoi and the State Committee. At Minahasa, in Indonesia, Newmont has an 80% interest but is attributed a greater percent of the gold production until it recoups the bulk of its investment including interest. Prior to November 2001, Newmont was attributed 100% of Minahasas gold production and subsequently 94%, as Newmont recouped some of its investment through the collection of funds in accordance with existing loan agreements. Equity gold ounces sold decreased to 147,200 ounces in 2002, compared to 341,500 and 354,200 equity ounces in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce were $218 in 2002, compared to $142 and $133 per ounce in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Production declined and costs increased in 2002 primarily due to processing lower grade ore. Mining activities ceased late in 2001; however, it is expected that processing of the remaining stockpiles will continue until the fourth quarter of 2004. Sales in 2003 are expected to be approximately 90,000 equity ounces, with total cash costs of approximately $239 per ounce. Equity sales at the Martha mine in New Zealand were 107,800 ounces in 2002 with total cash costs of $156 per equity ounce. Newmont acquired Martha as part of the Normandy acquisition. The mine is a joint venture between Newmont (67% ownership) and Otter Mines (33% ownership). Newmont NFM, owned 85.9% by Newmont, in turn owns over 90% of Otter Mines. Through separate transactions, Newmont is currently in the process of acquiring the minority interests of both Newmont NFM and Otter Mines, to give it 100% ownership in Martha (see Production Properties at page 21). We anticipate Martha will sell approximately 100,000 equity ounces of gold in 2003 at total cash costs of $188 per ounce. The wholly owned Ovacik mine near the Aegean Sea in western Turkey (acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition on February 15, 2002) sold 125,700 equity ounces of gold at total cash costs of $122 per ounce. Newmont expects Ovacik to sell approximately 130,000 equity ounces of gold at total cash costs of $165 per ounce in 2003. The increase in expected total cash costs per ounce in 2003 at Ovacik is primarily attributable to an increased proportion of higher cost underground mining compared to 2002. At the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia, copper sales totaled 362.3 million equity pounds (pounds attributable to Newmonts economic interest) in 2002, compared to 360.0 million and 294.2 million equity pounds in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash costs were $0.31, $0.37 and $0.59 per equity pound, after gold and silver by product credits, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Newmont holds an indirect 45% equity interest in the mine, but is attributed 56.25% of production until recouping the bulk of its investment, including interest. Net cash costs declined in 2002 compared to 2001 as operational improvements and the addition of a pebble crushing circuit added process throughput capacity, partially offset by lower grade ore. Gold sales, accounted for as by product credits, totaled 278,000, 295,100 and 178,400 equity ounces for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys equity income from Batu Hijau includes gold and silver revenues that are credited against costs applicable to sales as by product credits in the determination of net income for each period presented in the Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). These by product credits represented 44%, 42% and 27% of revenues and reduced production costs by 58%, 48% and 28% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Such by product credits are expected to continue while ore is being processed which, based on current engineering models, is estimated to be through the end of 2020. These by product credits are expected to vary from time to time and are significant to the economics of the Batu Hijau operation. At current copper prices, the Batu Hijau operation would not be profitable without these credits. The improvement in 2002 net cash costs per equity pound was also partially attributable to higher gold prices during the year, which resulted in higher by product credits. Sales in 2003 are expected to total approximately 340 to 360 million equity pounds of copper and 270,000 equity ounces of gold. Total cash costs per equity pound of copper in 2003 are expected to be approximately $0.28 to $0.30. The wholly owned Golden Grove copper/zinc operation in Western Australia, which was acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition, sold 45.7 million pounds of copper and 148.0 million pounds of zinc in 2002 at total 57 Table of Contents cash costs of $0.56 and $0.18 per pound, respectively. TVX Newmont Americas was 49.9% owned by Newmont and 50.1% owned by TVX Gold Inc. and was treated as an equity investment for reporting purposes in 2002. The principal assets of TVX Newmont Americas are interests in operating gold mines in South America (Paracatu, Crixas and La Coipa) and Canada (Musselwhite and New Britannia). Sales for 2002 were 183,500 equity ounces. On January 31, 2003, Newmont sold its 49.9% interest in TVX Newmont Americas to TVX Gold Inc. for $180 million. Newmont obtained a 48.8% interest in Echo Bay through its acquisition of Franco Nevada in February 2002. Franco Nevada purchased capital securities of Echo Bay with face value of $72.4 million in June 2001. In January 2002, $4.6 million of these capital securities were sold. Newmont acquired Franco Nevadas remaining holdings of Echo Bays capital securities in connection with its acquisition of Franco Nevada. Subsequent to this acquisition, an agreement was reached with Echo Bay and the capital securities holders to exchange the capital securities for common stock of Echo Bay. This exchange of capital securities debt obligations for common stock occurred on April 3, 2002 and resulted in Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont) owning 48.8% of Echo Bay. From April 3, 2002, Newmont accounted for its investment in Echo Bay under the equity method. On January 31, 2003, Kinross Gold Corporation, Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and TVX Gold Inc. were combined, and TVX Gold acquired Newmonts 49.9% interest in the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture. Under the terms of the combination and acquisition, Newmont received a 13.8% interest in the restructured Kinross in exchange for its 45.67% interest in Echo Bay and $180 million for its interest in TVX Newmont Americas. Newmont recorded a gain of approximately $90 million on the exchange of Echo Bay. During 2002, Newmonts share of Echo Bay gold sales was 185,200 equity ounces. Royalty Interests Newmonts merchant banking business holds royalty interests, which were acquired as a result of the Franco Nevada acquisition. Royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return (NSR) royalty that provides for the payment either in cash or physical metal (in kind) of a specified percentage of production, less certain specified transportation and refining costs. In some cases, Newmont owns a net profit interest (NPI) entitling Newmont to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case, from a particular mining operation. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in kind at the option of Newmont. Newmont earned $35.7 million of royalty revenue in 2002 and expects to earn approximately $38 million to $42 million in 2003. Financial Results Sales gold were $2.57 billion in 2002, an increase of 54% compared to gold sales of $1.67 billion in 2001, primarily reflecting the incremental impact of the acquired Newmont Australia Limited (formerly Normandy) operations and an increase in the average realized gold price. Gold sales in 2001 declined 8.4% from $1.82 billion in 2000 from lower production and a lower average realized gold price. Variances in sales revenue are illustrated in the following table: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated gold sales (in millions) $ 2,566.9 $ 1,666.1 $ 1,819.0 Consolidated production ozs. sold (in thousands) 8,217.9 6,141.8 6,472.9 Average price received per ounce $ 313 $ 271 $ 282 Average market price per ounce $ 310 $ 271 $ 279 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 Increase (decrease) in consolidated sales due to (in millions): Consolidated production $ 4.8 $ (92.3 ) Average gold price received 246.1 (60.6 ) Acquisition of Normandy 649.9 Total $ 900.8 $ (152.9 ) 58 Table of Contents Sales base metals totaled $55.3 million in 2002 and related primarily to the wholly owned and operated Golden Grove copper/zinc operation in Western Australia ($50.9 million), with a minor portion contributed by the Kasese cobalt operation ($4.4 million) that was sold in 2002. Golden Grove and Kasese were both acquired as part of the acquisition of Normandy. Royalties of $35.7 million were recorded during 2002 and were related primarily to the acquisition of Franco Nevada in February 2002. Royalty revenue pertained primarily to the Goldstrike and Stillwater properties. $11.4 million of royalties pertained to oil and gas interests in 2002. Gain (loss) on sale of marketable securities of Lihir of $47.3 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2002 when Newmont sold its 9.7% holding in Lihir Gold Limited. As a result, Newmont is no longer a shareholder of Lihir. Newmont realized proceeds of $84 million on the sale. A non cash write down of $23.9 million with respect to the Lihir marketable securities was recorded in 2000, resulting from an other than temporary decline in market value based on the length of time and the extent to which such value had been less than cost basis. This write down was reclassified to Sales and other income from Costs and expenses where it was classified in prior years to conform to 2002 presentation. During 2001, the valuation of the marketable securities of Lihir significantly increased, resulting in an $18.3 million gain, which was recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Dividends, interest, foreign currency exchange and other income increased to $39.8 million in 2002 from $7.4 million and $9.7 million in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Interest income totaled $14.1 million in 2002, compared to $3.0 million and $10.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in interest income in 2002 resulted primarily from the increase in the Companys average cash balances, partially offset by lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income in 2001 from 2000 reflected lower interest rates during the year. Foreign currency exchange gains in 2002 totaled $14.0 million, compared to losses of $5.1 million and $6.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gains in 2002 arose primarily from translation gains on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in A$ at the acquired Newmont Australia Limited, partially offset by losses from cross currency swaps and other foreign currency transactions. Other income also includes gains on the sale of exploration properties of $5.9 million, $3.1 million and $1.0 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Costs applicable to sales gold, which includes total cash costs and provisions for estimated final reclamation expenses related to consolidated gold production, increased to $1.54 billion in 2002 from $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in costs in 2002 primarily related to incremental impact of the mining operations acquired from Normandy, as well as an increase in the average total cash costs per ounce in 2002 to $189 per ounce from $184 and $170 per ounce in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce increased in 2002 primarily at Nevada and Yanacocha, which together accounted for 51% of equity gold sales in 2002. The increase in total cash costs per ounce in 2001 compared to 2000 is also primarily attributable to Nevada and Yanacocha, which represented 67% of equity gold sales in 2001. Costs applicable to sales base metals primarily related to the wholly owned and operated Golden Grove copper/zinc operation in Western Australia, with a minor portion contributed by the Kasese cobalt operation that was sold in 2002. Deferred stripping costs In general, mining costs are charged to Costs applicable to sales as incurred. However, at open pit mines, which generally have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios over the mine lives, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units of production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios; however industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Companys operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold with an 59 Table of Contents equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there could be greater volatility in the Companys period to period results of operations. Details of deferred stripping with respect to the Companys open pit mines where deferred stripping concept is applied are as follows (unaudited): Nevada(3) Mesquite(4) 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 125.1 138.4 145.1 n/a 237.6 120.7 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.073 0.066 0.066 n/a 0.023 0.018 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 72.2 88.9 106.6 n/a 155.5 180.4 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.081 0.060 0.060 n/a 0.031 0.016 Remaining Mine Life (years) 9 9 10 n/a 1 La Herradura(5) Minahasa(6) 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 141.3 177.0 144.4 n/a 14.5 19.8 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.031 0.035 0.032 n/a 0.172 0.195 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 158.5 200.0 228.4 n/a 15.9 16.4 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.026 0.025 0.024 n/a 0.131 0.205 Remaining Mine Life (years) 6 6 7 n/a 1 2002 Tanami Kalgoorie Martha Ovacik Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 61.9 95.0 28.8 26.3 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.113 0.065 0.093 0.356 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 78.4 101.0 33.2 29.1 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.107 0.052 0.100 0.358 Remaining Mine Life (years) 6 14 4 2 (1) Total tons to be mined in future divided by total ounces of gold to be recovered in future, based on proven and probable reserves. (2) Total tons mined divided by total ounces of gold recovered. (3) The life of mine stripping ratio decreased during 2002 and 2001 from 2000 reflecting the deferral of open pit projects in response to lower gold prices. The actual stripping ratio during 2002 and 2001 decreased from 2000 due to mining higher grade ore zones in the Twin Creeks pit. (4) The life of mine stripping ratio increased in 2001 versus 2000 reflecting significant changes to the mine plan in the final year of operations. The actual stripping ratio was lower during 2001 in comparison to 2000 as a result of mining higher grade material. (5) The life of mine stripping ratios decreased during 2002 from 2001 reflecting an increase in reserve ounces and increased during 2001 from 2000 reflecting an increase in reserves, which resulted in a change in the pit design. The actual stripping ratio decreased in 2002 from 2001 due to waste removal in 2001 in preparation for 2002 mining activities. 60 Table of Contents (6) The actual and life of mine stripping ratios decreased during 2001 from 2000 reflecting higher grade ore zones at the bottom of the Mesel pit as mining concluded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was $505.6 million, $301.6 million and $320.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 is primarily from the incremental impact of the acquired Newmont Australia Limited (formerly Normandy) operating sites and the amortization of mining royalty interests acquired from Franco Nevada as part of the February 2002 acquisitions. The increase also resulted from increased tons mined at Yanacocha in 2002 due to a full year of production at the La Quinua deposit and achieving a more consistent production profile over the prior year. The decrease in 2001 compared to 2000 resulted primarily from decreased gold production at Nevada, partially offset by the impact of 2000 capital expenditures at Yanacocha. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to total $560 million to $590 million in 2003. Variations in Depreciation, depletion and amortization are summarized as follows: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: North America: Nevada $ 118.2 $ 117.4 $ 126.4 Mesquite, California 6.3 7.5 9.1 La Herradura, Mexico 3.1 3.2 2.6 Golden Giant, Canada 20.5 18.3 25.8 Holloway, Canada 6.7 6.5 10.6 Total North America 154.8 152.9 174.5 South America: Yanacocha, Peru 121.5 82.3 68.8 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 13.8 19.5 23.9 Total South America 135.3 101.8 92.7 Australia: Pajingo 20.6 4.3 4.3 Kalgoorlie 9.0 Yandal 43.5 Tanami 32.5 Other 6.0 Total Australia 111.6 4.3 4.3 Other Operations: Zarafshan Newmont 10.3 11.9 14.0 Minahasa 9.5 22.8 26.7 Martha, New Zealand 13.9 Ovacik, Turkey 11.5 Total Other Operations 45.2 34.7 40.7 Other: Merchant Banking 22.6 Base Metals Operations 22.9 Exploration 7.8 1.6 0.4 Corporate and Other 5.4 6.3 8.1 Total Other 58.7 7.9 8.5 Total Newmont $ 505.6 $ 301.6 $ 320.7 61 Table of Contents Exploration and research expenses in 2002 were $88.9 million in 2002, an increase of 60% from $55.5 million in 2001. Expenditures in 2001 decreased from $77.4 million in 2000. Exploration activities in 2002 increased as a result of the integration of the Normandy and Franco Nevada exploration programs and from the increase in available capital to fund exploration activities due to higher prevailing gold prices in 2002. The 2002 exploration program added approximately 9.4 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves replacing depletion in 2002. The decrease in 2001 exploration expenditures reflected planned reductions as a result of lower gold prices and an increased focus on exploration activities at or around existing operations. Exploration expenditures are expected to be approximately $95 million to $100 million in 2003. General and administrative was $115.3 million in 2002, an increase of 88% compared to $61.2 million in 2001 and 81% compared to $63.7 million in 2000. The increase in 2002 primarily relates to increased administrative costs resulting from the integration of Normandy and Franco Nevada. General and administrative is expected to be approximately $90 to $95 million in 2003 as the Company begins to realize benefits from the on going synergies of the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $129.6 million, $98.1 million and $106.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $5.2 million, $10.6 million and $5.5 million in each year, respectively. Net interest expense increased in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Normandy of approximately $913.7 million. Net interest expense in 2001 decreased from 2000 because of lower average interest rates and higher capitalized interest for Yanacocha. Interest expense is expected to total approximately $90 million to $95 million in 2003. Expenses for acquisition settlement of $42.2 million in 2000 related to the resolution of a dispute regarding Newmonts purchase of an additional 13.35% interest in Minera Yanacocha as described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Write down of assets totaled $48.1 million, $57.8 million and $75.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, the Company reduced the carrying value of certain assets by $48.1 million pre tax, with the majority of the write down relating to the reduction of inventories to lower of cost or net realizable value. The write downs related to Nevada ($37.0 million), Minahasa ($4.6 million), Newmont Australia ($2.4 million), Wiluna ($1.6 million), Kori Kollo ($1.0 million), the Ity property ($0.8 million) and other operations ($0.7 million). In Nevada, ore stockpile inventory was reduced by $32 million as a result of both net realizable value analysis and a comprehensive physical survey of all stockpiles, while leach pad, mill in process and finished goods inventories were reduced by $2.9 million, $1.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. At the Minahasa mine the leach pad inventory, finished goods inventory and materials and supply inventories were reduced by $0.2 million, $2.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively. At Newmont Australia, $2.4 million in undeveloped mineral interests was written down. Ore stockpile inventory was reduced $1.2 million and mill in process inventory was reduced by $0.4 million at the Wiluna mine. At Kori Kollo, the write down reduced materials and supply inventories by $0.5 million and fixed assets were abandoned with a net historical cost of $0.5 million. Reductions of inventories at other operations totaled $0.7 million. Finally, the Ity mine was sold in the first quarter of 2002, with the future estimated royalty payments recorded as a receivable at fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that future royalty payments were uncertain due to political unrest in the region where the operations are located and a loss of $0.8 million was recorded. In 2001, the Company reduced the carrying value of certain long lived and other assets by $57.8 million pre tax. Total write downs related to Minahasa ($19.8 million), Nevada ($23.2 million), Kori Kollo ($4.9 million), Yanacocha ($4.9 million), the San Luis property in Colorado ($3.5 million) and other operations ($1.5 million). The write down of long lived assets represented the excess carrying value of assets compared to fair value, with fair value determined using discounted future cash flow analysis. Such cash flows are based on estimated recoverable ounces, future production and capital costs, and gold price assumptions. The assumed gold price was $285 per ounce for 2002 and $300 per ounce for all future years. The Minahasa write down reduced fixed assets by $12.1 million, increased reclamation liabilities by $3.7 million and reduced stockpiles, ore on 62 Table of Contents leach pads, and materials and supply inventories by $1.8 million, $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Nevada write down reduced stockpiles, ore on leach pads and in process inventory by $18.3 million, fixed assets by $4.4 million and precious metals by $0.5 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced fixed assets by $4.8 million and in process inventory by $0.1 million. The San Luis write down reduced fixed assets by $2.0 million and materials and supply inventories by $1.5 million. At Yanacocha heap leach inventory was reduced $4.1 million and other assets were reduced $0.8 million, and total inventory reductions of $1.5 million were recorded at other operations. In 2000, total write downs of $75.9 were recorded on long lived and other assets. The reductions related to the Holloway mine in Canada ($30.8 million), the short lived Mesquite mine in California ($14.8 million), Nevada ($13.6 million), the Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia ($5.7 million), the acquisition cost of the Mezcala property in Mexico ($6.5 million), the Minahasa mine in Indonesia ($3.8 million) and the Battle Mountain Complex in Nevada ($0.7 million). The Holloway write down reduced fixed assets by $30.8 million. Mesquites write down reduced leach pad inventory by $9.7 million, deferred stripping by $1.4 million and fixed assets by $3.7 million. Stockpile and mill in process inventories were reduced $9.7 million and $3.9 million at Nevada, respectively. The Kori Kollo write down reduced inventory by $5.0 million and fixed assets by $0.7 million. In process and ore on leach pads inventories at Minahasa were reduced by $3.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The Company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined using estimated future cash flow analysis. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed engineering life of mine plans. The term recoverable ounces refers to the estimated amount of gold that will be obtained from proven and probable reserves after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. Generally, all assets at a particular operation are used together to generate cash flow. Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions and or the Companys performance could have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, that established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement was adopted on January 1, 2002, and there was no impact to the Company upon adoption. The Company records inventories at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and inventory carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. Net realizable value is calculated as the estimated future sales price of the product based on prevailing and long term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write downs of inventories include prevailing short term and long term metals prices and prevailing costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as actually realized ore grades and production throughput. Merger and restructuring expenses of $60.5 million in 2001 included $28.1 million of transaction and related costs associated with the Battle Mountain merger and $32.4 million of restructuring expenses that included $22.1 million for voluntary early retirement pension benefits and $10.3 million for employee severance and office closures. 63 Table of Contents Other expenses in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $29.5 million, $11.5 million and $34.6 million, respectively. Included in 2002 are approximately $7.3 million of integration costs relating to the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada, $16.8 million of severance and other benefits, and $3.1 million for officers life insurance. Also included in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $5.2 million, $1.0 million and $12.3 million, respectively, for increases to environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Environmental expenses in 2002 primarily relate to legal costs incurred with respect to the Pinal Creek site (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The year 2000 also included $13.2 million to increase the remediation liability for San Luis, Colorado and $10.0 million for costs associated with a mercury spill at Yanacocha, both described in the Environmental section of this discussion and analysis. (Loss) gain on derivative instruments totaled $(39.8) million in 2002, compared to $1.8 million and $26.8 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and relates to non cash mark to market gains and losses recognized on gold derivative instruments. The loss in 2002 primarily relates to the acquired Normandy gold hedge books and resulted from the increase in the US$ gold price from $300 per ounce at February 15, 2002, the date of acquisition of Normandy, to $347 at December 31, 2002, partially offset by the appreciation in the A$ from $0.5175 at February 15, 2002 to $0.5645 at December 31, 2002. The majority of the acquired Normandy gold hedge books consist of contracts to receive Australian dollars and to deliver gold. Generally, higher gold prices increase Newmonts derivative liability position, whereas appreciation in the Australian dollar decreases Newmonts derivative liability position. Prior to the acquisition of Normandy, (Loss) gain on derivative instruments primarily reflected the change in fair value of written call option contracts at the end of each year. In September 2001, Newmont entered into transactions that closed out these call options. These options were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. The call options were marked to the market value of $53.8 million immediately prior to their close, resulting in a non cash gain of $1.8 million in 2001. The value of the new sales contracts was recorded as Deferred revenue from sale of future production and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. In 2000, the non cash mark to market gain on the written call options was $26.8 million. Income tax (expense) benefit was $(19.9) million in 2002, compared to $59.3 million and $(5.6) million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys effective tax rates were (9.2)%, 94.0%, and (14.3)% based on Pre tax income (loss) before minority interest, equity income (loss) of affiliates and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $216.3 million, $(63.1) million and $38.9 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The factors that most significantly impact the Companys effective tax rate are percentage depletion and resource allowances, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, foreign currency translation gains and losses and special non recurring items. Most of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that exceed the Companys tax basis in its mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by US subsidiaries included in the Companys consolidated US income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold or other minerals produced by the Company. In general, such deductions are calculated separately for each operating mine and are based on a complex two part formula that considers the net of royalty revenue received from sales of the mine output and the taxable income from the particular mine that produced the output. Similar types of deductions are provided for mining operations in Canada and are referred to as resource allowances. The tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $34.4 million, $17.3 million and $17.5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The increase in 2002 compared to the other periods resulted primarily from the rise in the Companys average realized gold price to $313 compared to $271 and $282 for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company also operates in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives, and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences contribute to move the Companys overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the US statutory rate and the effect of these differences are shown in the Income Tax footnote as either a rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings net 64 Table of Contents of credits allowable in the United States for taxes paid to non US taxing jurisdictions that arise when the related foreign earnings become taxable in the United States. Coupled with differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations, the Companys ability to fully utilize all of its available foreign income tax credits on a year by year basis also is highly dependent on the price of the minerals produced by the Company since lower prices could result in the Company having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have very limited carryback and carryforward periods and can only be used to reduce the US income tax imposed on the Companys foreign earnings included in its annual US consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, were reductions of income tax expense of $16.7 million, $29.5 million and $29.5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in the reduction in 2002 was primarily attributable to (i) significant pre tax losses in certain non US taxing jurisdictions such as Australia where the tax rates are lower than the US statutory rate; (ii) tax incentives from the reinvestment of earnings in Peru being lower in 2002; and (iii) an increase in the Companys earnings from its Canadian operations from higher gold prices and acquisitions given that Canadian income tax rates are higher than the US statutory tax rate; partially offset by (iv) the lower rate on Canadian capital gains realized from the Companys sale of the marketable securities of Lihir. The need to record valuation allowances related to the Companys deferred tax assets (primarily attributable net operating losses and tax credits) is primarily dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) the Companys long term estimate of future average realized minerals prices and; (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements imposed upon the Company and its subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and credit carryforwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carryforward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities accrued for financial reporting purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Increases to income tax expense or reductions of income tax benefits were $2.5 million, $17.3 million and $51.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, the Company reversed part of a valuation allowance reflecting the actual utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforward of a subsidiary acquired in a prior pooling of interests business combination, offset by valuation allowances recorded for losses in the acquired Newmont Australia Limited (NAL) group of companies. The major factor in the decline in 2002, however, resulted from the Companys ability to utilize substantially all of its currently arising foreign tax credits due to rising taxable income from higher gold prices. In 2001, however, it experienced a limitation on the use of such credits due to lower taxable income in the United States primarily caused by lower gold prices. In 2000, valuation allowances were higher compared to 2001, resulting from not having available prior period net operating losses. The higher valuation allowances also resulted from lower utilization of foreign tax credits due to higher foreign earnings remittances and earnings in Peru causing more foreign taxes to be available as credits, as well as a lack of sufficient taxable income in the United States to utilize such credits, again caused by low gold prices. The Company consolidates subsidiaries with interests attributable to minority interests, but for tax purposes, the Company is responsible for the income taxes only on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to its ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such minority interest contributed to the overall reduction in the Companys effective income tax rate by $11.5 million, $10.1 million and $19.4 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The reduction in 2002 increased from 2001 due to a higher gold price that was partially offset by fewer reinvestment credits at Yanacocha under Peruvian tax regulations. The reduction in 2000 was greater than in 2001 from higher earnings from the Yanacocha project in Peru due to a combination of higher gold prices and reinvestment credits. The Companys effective tax rate in 2002 was increased by $9.3 million of foreign currency translation losses primarily related to monetary assets and liabilities and the gold derivatives positions in Newmont Australia 65 Table of Contents Limited whose functional currency is the US dollar. Because Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from NAL, such translation losses are not subject to deferred tax. During 2002, the Company settled an audit conducted by the Internal Revenue Service of the tax returns of an acquired entity involving several taxable periods that predated the Companys acquisition. At issue was the proper federal income tax treatment of a portion of a transaction involving an exchange of natural resource properties. The settlement gave rise to additional future tax deductions the tax benefit of which had previously not been recorded and for which no deferred taxes were required to be provided. Accordingly, the Companys effective tax rate for 2002 has been reduced by approximately $10 million due to this non recurring item. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing the Companys effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, Newmonts effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. Equity income (loss) of affiliates totaled $51.4 million, $22.5 million and $(17.7) million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, the Company recorded equity income (loss) from Batu Hijau, the copper and gold project in Indonesia in which Newmont has a 56.25% effective interest, of $42.1 million, compared to $22.5 million and $(17.7) million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Batu Hijau represented all of Newmonts equity income (loss) in 2001 and 2000, whereas in 2002, the Company also recorded $9.7 million for TVX Newmont Americas, $(0.4) million for Echo Bay, $(1.8) million for Australian Magnesium Corporation and $1.7 million for AGR Matthey Joint Venture. The new equity investments in 2002 were acquired as part of the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada. Equity income of Batu Hijau improved in 2002 primarily from lower net cash costs in 2002, primarily from higher gold by product credits due to higher prevailing gold prices and production throughput capacity improvements, partially offset by lower grade ore. The improvements included operational initiatives and the addition of a pebble crushing circuit. Lower costs in 2002 at Batu Hijau were partially offset by a lower average realized copper price for the year as compared to 2001. The equity income of Batu Hijau in 2001 improved dramatically from 2000 due to the full impact of the ramp up in production that commenced in the fourth quarter of 1999. TVX Newmont Americas was 49.9% owned by Newmont and 50.1% owned by TVX Gold Inc. during 2002. The principal assets of TVX Newmont Americas are interests in operating gold mines in South America (Paracatu, Crixas and La Coipa) and Canada (Musselwhite and New Britannia). On January 31, 2003, Newmont sold its 49.9% interest in TVX Newmont Americas to TVX Gold Inc. for $180 million. Newmont held a weighted average ownership of 45.7% in Echo Bay Mines Limited in 2002 from April 3, 2002 to December 31, 2002. On January 31, 2003, Kinross Gold Corporation, TVX Gold Inc. and Echo Bay combined, and Newmont exchanged its investment in Echo Bay for approximately 13.8% of the new Kinross. Newmonts investment in Kinross will be accounted for as a marketable security in 2003. Newmont recorded a gain of approximately $90 million on the sale of Echo Bay in the first quarter of 2003. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in 2002 included a $(28.7) million loss for a minimum pension liability adjustment, $(16.7) million for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and $(12.8) million for a decline in value of marketable equity securities, partially offset by a $3.6 million gain from foreign currency translation adjustments related to the Companys subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company was required to record a minimum liability in 2002. As a result of such adjustment, an intangible asset was recorded and, to the extent the minimum liability adjustment exceeded the unrecognized net transition liability, Stockholders equity was reduced. The unrealized losses on derivatives in 2002 related primarily to the effective portion of the change in fair value of gold instruments assumed as part of the Normandy acquisition that were designated as cash flow hedges. The losses resulted primarily from rising gold prices during the year, partially offset by a strengthening Australian dollar. The impact of the marketable equity securities in 2002 primarily included $(18.3) million related to the sale of Lihir, partially offset by the Companys share of unrealized gains on marketable securities held in Echo Bay. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in 2001 included an $18.3 million gain for temporary changes in the market value of Lihir Gold securities, $3.2 million for losses associated with foreign currency translation adjustments and $0.9 million for 66 Table of Contents the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. For 2000, other comprehensive loss, net of tax, included a loss of $1.8 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and a $1.3 million minimum pension liability adjustment. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS Nos. 141 and 142, Business Combinations and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, respectively. The adoption of these standards on January 1, 2002, as required, did not impact Newmonts historical Consolidated Financial Statements or results of operations as of that date. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada were accounted for as purchases under SFAS 141 and a significant portion of the $4.3 billion purchase price represents goodwill, resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Such goodwill will not be amortized, but will be subject to impairment testing at least annually, as required by SFAS 142. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company reclassified $177.0 million of acquired mineral rights and leases from Property, plant and mine development, net to Mineral interests and other intangible assets, net. Acquired proven and probable reserves are amortized using the units of production basis over the respective mine lives. Undeveloped mineral interests are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, taking into account residual values. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established a methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement was adopted as required on January 1, 2003, when Newmont recorded the estimated fair value of reclamation liabilities (asset retirement obligations or ARO) and increased the carrying amount of the related assets (asset retirement cost or ARC) to be retired in the future. The ARC will be depreciated over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from revisions to either the timing or amount of the original ARO fair value estimate. Newmont expects to record increases of approximately $60 to $75 million in the ARC, net increases of approximately $110 million to $135 million to the ARO, increases of approximately $1 million to $3 million to accrued liabilities for worker participation bonuses in Peru, increases to deferred tax assets of approximately $10 million to $14 million, a reduction to Newmonts investment in Batu Hijau of approximately $3 million to $9 million and a reduction in minority interest in subsidiaries of approximately $14 million to $18 million, at January 1, 2003, with a cumulative effect of adoption of approximately $30 million to $40 million to be recorded in results of operations in the first quarter of 2003. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement was adopted January 1, 2002, and there was no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption. In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4 , 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. The statement nullified SFAS 4, SFAS 44 and SFAS 64 and established that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The Statement also amends SFAS Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions and to make technical corrections to various other FASB statements. For the provisions of the statement relating to the extinguishment of debt, SFAS 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions relating to SFAS 13 are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002, and all other provisions are effective for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002. There was no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 67 Table of Contents In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addressed financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. It nullified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan as was required under EITF No. 94 3. SFAS 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, and we do not anticipate any impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption except with respect to those exit or disposal activities that are initiated by the Company after that date. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, to provide alternative methods for voluntary transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. SFAS 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements 5, 57, 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 requires recognition and measurement of guarantees entered into or modified beginning on January 1, 2003 and requires expanded disclosure of guarantees as of December 31, 2002. The Company has conformed its disclosures with respect to guarantees to the requirements of FIN 45. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which provides guidance on the identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46 impacts accounting for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and requires expanded disclosure of variable interest entities for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The Company has determined that there will be no impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption. Liquidity and Capital Resources For 2002, Net cash provided by operating activities was $670.3 million, compared to $369.7 million and $534.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Increased operating cash flows in 2002 primarily reflect the impact of operating cash flows from the Normandy and Franco Nevada operations from February 15, 2002 and the impact of an increased average realized gold price in 2002 of $313 per ounce. Operating cash flows in 2001 declined from 2000 due to a lower average realized gold price of $271 per ounce in 2001 compared to $282 per ounce in 2000. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $112.1 million, $(385.0) million and $(510.5) million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additions to property, plant and mine development were $(300.1) million, $(390.0) and $(387.4) million. See Capital Expenditures below for more information on capital expenditures in each year. Cash from investing activities in 2002 also included $404.4 million of proceeds from the sales of short term investments obtained as part of the acquisition of Franco Nevada, $84 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of Lihir and $50.8 million of proceeds from the settlement of cross currency swaps that were obtained as part of the Normandy acquisition, offset by $90.3 million of net cash outflows for the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada ($461.7 million cash consideration for Normandy shares, less cash acquired from acquisitions, net of acquisition costs, of $371.4 million), $24.8 million of cash advances to affiliated companies and $21.1 million of cash outflows to settle ineffective derivative instruments. There were 68 Table of Contents no significant investing cash flows other than capital expenditures in 2001, but in 2000, there were $78.8 million of advances to affiliated companies and $54.7 million of costs associated with the merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(530.1) million in 2002, compared to $85.1 million and $(65.4) million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Financing activities in 2002 included drawings on the Companys credit facilities of $493.4 million to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of Normandy. Such drawings were paid down shortly after the acquisition with the proceeds from the sale of the Franco Nevada short term investments. Including paying down the credit facilities, the Company repaid approximately $1.0 billion of debt. See Financing Activities below. Dividend payments for 2002 totaled $50.0 million, and the Company received approximately $67.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from the exercise of employee stock options. In 2001, Newmont received proceeds from long term debt of $1.0 billion and repaid $941.6 million, paid $31.0 million of dividends and benefited from the lifting of restrictions on $40.0 million of cash. Newmont made payments of debt, net of new proceeds, of $46.6 million and paid dividends of $27.6 million in 2000. Newmonts contractual obligations at December 31, 2002 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years (in millions) Long term debt $ 1,499.3 $ 78.6 $ 624.5 $ 117.5 $ 678.7 Capital lease obligations 317.3 36.7 61.5 72.1 147.0 Operating leases 25.9 3.8 6.8 5.9 9.4 Total $ 1,842.5 $ 119.1 $ 692.8 $ 195.5 $ 835.1 For information on the Companys long term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Notes 11 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Newmont believes it will be able to fund all existing obligations from Net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes it will be able to raise capital as needed in capital markets in the future as opportunities for expansion arise. 69 Table of Contents Investing Activities Additions to Property, plant and mine development Capital expenditures for property, plant and mine development decreased in 2002 from 2001 primarily from the completion of the development of the La Quinua project at Yanacocha in late 2001. Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 remained approximately the same. Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Capital expenditures: North America: Nevada $ 54.6 $ 47.1 $ 65.7 Mesquite, California 0.4 0.8 La Herradura, Mexico 1.4 0.9 3.0 Golden Giant, Canada 6.6 7.1 14.9 Holloway, Canada 1.2 1.5 5.5 Total North America 63.8 57.0 89.9 South America: Yanacocha, Peru 146.2 276.9 276.9 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 0.6 10.5 7.8 Total South America 146.8 287.4 284.7 Australia: Pajingo 10.2 7.3 4.9 Kalgoorlie 8.6 Yandal 20.7 Tanami 10.5 Total Australia 50.0 7.3 4.9 Other Operations: Zarafshan Newmont, Uzbekistan 3.9 20.4 4.3 Minahasa, Indonesia 0.5 Martha, New Zealand 5.3 Ovacik, Turkey 4.0 Total Other Operations 13.2 20.4 4.8 Other: Base Metals Operations 10.7 Corporate and Other 15.6 17.9 3.1 Total Other 26.3 17.9 3.1 Total Newmont $ 300.1 $ 390.0 $ 387.4 In 2002, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($15.3 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground and Midas mines), development of the Leeville project and optimization of the Phoenix project ($16.4 million), the Lone Tree Tailings Dam expansion ($5.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included leach pad expansions ($69.2 million), mine development ($16.7 million), environmental expenditures ($14.3 million), carbon columns and refinery ($12.9 million) and other replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Zarafshan Newmont included $3.4 million for the completion of the heap leach pad expansion and associated conveyor support. Capital expenditures at Yandal included deferred mine development ($14.3 million). Capital expenditures at Pajingo included mine development ($5.6 million) and replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Kalgoorlie included haul truck purchases ($3.6 million) and replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Golden Grove included mine development of $6.1 million and replacement capital. 70 Table of Contents In 2001, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($15.7 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), mine facilities at Deep Post ($9.9 million), mining equipment ($6.3 million), development of the Phoenix project ($4.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($128.4 million), Yanacocha leach pad operations ($44.9 million), mining equipment ($44.3 million), Carachugo leach pad operations ($19.3 million) and other replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Zarafshan Newmont included $19 million for heap leach pad expansion and associated conveyor support facility. In 2000, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($27.5 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), development of the Phoenix project ($9.8 million), mining equipment ($10.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($144.2 million), unitization of regional properties ($45.7 million), leach pad expansion ($30.8 million), mine development ($30.0 million) and other replacement capital. Newmont expects to spend approximately $560 million to $590 million on capital projects in 2003, with approximately $123 million in North America, $95 million in Australia, $260 million in South America and approximately $97 million in other locations. The majority of budgeted expenditures are for mine development and replacement capital. In Nevada, two expansion projects, the Gold Quarry South Layback (GQSL) and the Leeville Underground Mine (Leeville), are under way. GQSL is located in South Area at Carlin and is expected to yield approximately 2.7 million ounces of production, with annual production of between 320,000 and 770,000 ounces commencing in 2004. Total capital expenditures for GQSL are projected to be approximately $37 million, of which $6.7 million had been spent as of December 31, 2002. Leeville is located in Carlins North Area and will produce approximately 3.0 million ounces, with annual production of approximately 500,000 commencing at the end of 2005. Total capital expenditures for Leeville are projected to be $185 million, of which $15.1 million had been spent as of December 31, 2002. Other Investing Activities TVX Newmont Americas and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. On January 31, 2003, Kinross Gold Corporation, Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and TVX Gold Inc. were combined, and TVX Gold acquired Newmonts 49.9% interest in the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture. Under the terms of the combination and acquisition, Newmont received a 13.8% interest in the restructured Kinross in exchange for its 45.67% interest in Echo Bay and $180 million for its interest in TVX Newmont Americas. Newmont recorded a pre tax gain on the exchange of its shares in Echo Bay of approximately $90 million. Batu Hijau As discussed above and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Newmont has an indirect 45% interest in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and its partner, an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation, has an indirect 35% interest. Because Newmont and Sumitomo carried the interest of the 20% Indonesian partner, Newmont recognizes 56.25% of Batu Hijaus income until recouping the bulk of its investment. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Newmonts investment in Batu Hijau was $610.1 million and $543.3 million, respectively. On May 9, 2002, P.T.Newmont Nusa Tenggara (PTNNT) completed a restructuring of its $1.0 billion project financing facility (Senior Debt) that provides PTNNT the ability to defer up to $173.4 million in principal payments scheduled for 2002 and 2003. The restructuring provides a better match between the expected cash flows of the project and the maturities of the debt. Any deferred principal amounts will be repaid between 2004 and 2010. Under this restructuring, Batu Hijau is not permitted to pay dividends or make other restricted payments to Newmont or its partner as long as any amount of deferred principal is outstanding; however, there is no restriction on prepaying any of the deferred principal amounts. Amounts outstanding under the project financing total $913.3 million at December 31, 2002. The amount of deferred principal at December 31, 2002 71 Table of Contents was $86.5 million. Newmont and its partner provide a contingent support line of credit to PTNNT. During 2002, Newmont funded $24.8 million under this contingent support facility as its pro rata share of capital expenditures. Additional support from Newmont and its partner available under this facility amounts to $115.0 million, of which Newmonts pro rata share is $64.7 million. Australian Magnesium Corporation As of December 31, 2002, Newmont had a 22.8% voting interest in Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC). Since then, AMC has raised additional equity to support the development of the Stanwell Magnesium Project, a proprietary chemical and dehydration process for producing anhydrous magnesium chloride as feed for an electrolytic cell to produce molten magnesium metal and magnesium alloys. Northerly Equities Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Australia Limited (NAL), contributed A$100 million (approximately $56 million) in equity to AMC on January 3, 2003, increasing our ownership percentage to 40.9%. However, due to additional equity contributions by third party shareholders, our voting interest decreased to 27.8% on January 31, 2003. NAL and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nottacar Investments Pty Ltd, had also provided to AMC a A$90 million (approximately $51 million) contingent equity commitment in the event the project does not achieve certain specified production and operating criteria by December 2006. Subsequent to year end, however, this contingent equity commitment was renegotiated to require instead that NAL and Nottacar Investments provide AMC with an A$75 million (approximately $42 million) contingent convertible debt and equity facility. NAL has also guaranteed a $30 million obligation payable by AMC to Ford Motor Company in the event the project does not meet certain specified production and operating criteria by November 2005. AMC has indemnified NAL for this obligation, but the indemnity is unsecured. NAL and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries are also guarantors of an $A71 million (approximately $40 million) amortizing loan facility of AMCs subsidiary, QMC Finance Pty Ltd. (QMC), of which A$69.8 million (approximately $39 million) was outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The QMC loan facility expires in November 2006. QMC also is a party to a series of foreign exchange hedging contracts. All obligations related to these contracts have been guaranteed by NAL and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The contracts include a series of foreign exchange forward contracts and bought put options, the last of which expire in June 2006. As of December 31, 2002, the fair value of these contracts was a negative A$12.7 million (approximately $7 million). The Ford guarantee and the guarantees under the QMC loan and hedging facilities arose in connection with NALs support of the project as an investor in AMC and its predecessor entities. The guarantees under the QMC loan facility and hedging contracts could be called in the event of a default by QMC. NALs liability under the QMC loan facility guarantee is limited to the total amount of outstanding borrowings under the facility at the time the guarantee is called. NALs maximum potential liability under its guarantee of the QMC hedging contracts, however, would depend on the market value of the hedging contracts at the time the guarantee is exercised. The principal lender and counterparty under the QMC loan and hedging facilities also has a fixed and floating charge over certain assets of AMC. In the event the guarantees are called, NAL would have a right of subrogation to the lender under Australian law. Takeover Bid for Otter Gold Mines Limited. On December 4, 2002, Newmont NFM announced its intentions to make an offer for all shares and options in Otter Gold Mines Limited (Otter Mines) that Newmont NFM did not already own. Newmont NFM is an Australian corporation that is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Otter Mines is a New Zealand corporation that is also listed on the ASX. As of the date of making the announcement, the Company, through subsidiaries, held an 85.86% interest in Newmont NFM and Newmont NFM, in turn, held 89.17% of the 72 Table of Contents outstanding Otter Mines shares. Newmont NFMs offer was made on January 9, 2003 and closed on February 25, 2003. By the close of the offer, Newmont NFM had acquired in excess of 90% of the total outstanding shares in Otter Mines, which, under New Zealand law, entitled Newmont NFM to compulsorily acquire all remaining outstanding Otter Mines shares. Newmont NFM has initiated the compulsory acquisition process and anticipates that through this process it will own 100% of Otter Mines by the end of April 2003. Newmont NFM Limited Arrangement NAL owns 85.86% of Newmont NFM. On November 28, 2002, Newmont Australia and Newmont NFM announced a proposal that, if approved by Newmont NFM shareholders and the Federal Court of Australia (the Court), would result in Newmont NFM becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of NAL. Under the proposal, Newmont NFM shareholders would have the opportunity to either participate in a share buy back in which Newmont NFM would pay A$16.50 for each Newmont NFM share or receive 4.40 ASX listed Newmont Mining Corporation CHESS Depository Instruments (Newmont CDIs) per Newmont NFM Share. Newmont CDIs are the equivalent of one tenth ( 1/10th) of a share of Newmont common stock. On February 21, 2003, the Court approved the information booklet that was proposed to be sent to Newmont NFM shareholders, and the Court also convened shareholders meetings for April 2, 2003. The information booklet was sent to Newmont NFM shareholders in early March. If the requisite majority of Newmont NFM shareholders vote in favor of the arrangement at the April 2, 2003 scheme meetings, Newmont NFM will apply to the Court for approval of the arrangement. The Court hearing is scheduled for April 11, 2003. If approved by the Court, the arrangement would become effective on the following day and processing of shareholder elections in respect of the buy back and the Newmont CDIs would be completed during April 2003. Pension Funding Due to poor returns on plan assets during the last few years, Newmont expects to fund approximately $20 million into its pension plans in 2003 from Net cash provided by operating activities. Financing Activities Scheduled minimum long term debt repayments are $115.3 million in 2003, $194.2 million in 2004, $491.8 million in 2005, $101.2 million in 2006, $88.4 million in 2007 and $825.7 million thereafter. Newmont expects to be able to fund maturities of its debt from operating cash flow. The Companys $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into June 1997, was replaced in October 2001 with two unsecured multi currency revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 million facility with an initial term of 364 days, which may be extended annually to October 2006; and a $400 million revolving facility, which matures in October 2006. In February 2002, in connection with the Normandy transaction, Newmont acquired an additional A$490 million committed revolving multi option facility with a syndicate of banks. In May 2002, Newmont repaid the $170.6 million outstanding under this facility, closed it and added an additional $150 million Australian bank tranche to the existing facilities for a total borrowing capacity of $750 million. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the Companys credit rating. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 0.70% to 0.975% or the greater of the federal funds rate or the lead banks prime rate. Annual fees vary from 0.10% to 0.40%. At December 31, 2002, the fees were 0.15%, 0.175% and 0.30% of the commitment, for the $200 million, the $400 million and the $150 million facilities, respectively. The facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified limitations on debt to capitalization and debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, 73 Table of Contents and restrictions on incurring liens and transactions with affiliates. There were no borrowings under the facilities as of December 31, 2002. The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. In July 1999, the Company entered into a prepaid forward gold sales contract (the Prepaid Forward) and a forward gold purchase contract (the Forward Purchase). Under the Prepaid Forward, the Company agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces (the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company also agreed under the Prepaid Forward to deliver semi annually 17,951 ounces of gold, beginning June 2000 through June 2007 (the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements) for a total gold delivery obligation over the life of the Prepaid Forward of 752,598 ounces. At the time the Prepaid Forward was entered into, the Company received net proceeds of $137.2 million ($145.0 million of gross proceeds before transaction costs of $653,000 and the purchase of a $7.1 million surety bond to guarantee delivery of the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company may also be entitled to receive additional proceeds in the future in connection with the annual deliveries of 161,111 ounces, to be determined at each delivery date based on the excess, if any, of the then market price for gold (up to a maximum of $380 per ounce) over $300 per ounce. At the time the Company entered into the Prepaid Forward, it also entered into the Forward Purchase, with the same counterparty, to hedge the price risk with respect to the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements. The Forward Purchase provides for semi annual purchases of 17,951 ounces of gold on each semi annual delivery date under the Prepaid Forward at prices increasing from $263 per ounce in 2000 to $354 per ounce in 2007. On each semi annual delivery date, the ounces purchased under the Forward Purchase are delivered in satisfaction of the Companys delivery requirements under the Prepaid Forward. The transaction has been accounted for as a single borrowing of $145 million, with interest accruing, based on an effective interest rate recognized over the full term of the borrowing. Unsecured notes with a principal amount of $150 million due April 1, 2002, bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625% were outstanding at December 31, 2001. Interest was payable semi annually in April and October and the notes were not redeemable prior to maturity. The notes were repaid in April 2002. In May 2001, Newmont issued unsecured notes with a principal amount of $275 million due May 2011 bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625%. Proceeds of $272 million, after transaction costs, were used to repay debt outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility, with the remainder for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in May and November and the notes are redeemable prior to maturity under certain conditions. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Newmont now consolidates two additional unsecured series of notes from Newmont Australia. In July 1998, Normandy Finance Limited (NFL) issued $150.0 million of ten year 7 5/8% guaranteed notes. Interest on the notes is paid semi annually in arrears in January and July and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Also, in July 1998, NFL issued $100.0 million of seven year 7 1/2% guaranteed notes. Interest on the notes is paid semi annually in arrears in January and July and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Both the 7 5/8% notes and the 7 1/2% notes are guaranteed by NAL and certain of its subsidiaries. In April 1998, Normandy Yandal Operations Limited (NYOL), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont, issued $300 million of ten year 8 7/8% senior unsecured notes. In conjunction with the Normandy acquisition, NYOL was acquired by Newmont in February 2002. In March 2002, Newmont, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, made an offer to repurchase any and all of NYOLs outstanding 8 7/8% Senior Notes due 2008. As of the offer date, $300 million principal amount of notes was outstanding. The repurchase offer was made pursuant to the terms of an Indenture dated as of April 7, 1998, between NYOL and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Indenture requires that Newmont Yandal, following a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture, make an offer to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. Although the applicable provisions of the 74 Table of Contents Indenture can be read to the contrary, Newmont took the position that a Change of Control occurred on February 20, 2002 when Newmont acquired control of Normandy. The Indenture provides that NYOL is not required to make the Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the offer. Newmonts offer, however, should not be construed as a commitment by Newmont to provide ongoing financial or credit support to NYOL. The Change of Control Offer was open until May 14, 2002, resulted in redemption of $62.8 million of the outstanding notes and gave rise to a $0.6 million loss on extinguishment recorded in Other expenses. At December 31, 2002, $237.2 million was outstanding in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The NYOL notes are non recourse to Newmont and have not been assumed or otherwise guaranteed by Newmont. Interest on the notes is paid semi annually in arrears in April and October. Certain financial instruments were entered into whereby NYOL has agreed to exchange US dollar fixed interest amounts payable with a gold interest rate. Of the total, US$183.6 million has been swapped into a gold interest rate, of which half is fixed at 3.87% and half is floating. The floating rate at December 31, 2002 was 0.865%. Because these notes are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the debt. See Note 11 for additional information. All NYOL debt is non recourse to Newmont. In April 2002, Newmont announced the redemption of all issued and outstanding shares of its $3.25 convertible preferred stock as of May 15, 2002. The Company paid a redemption price of $50.325 per share, plus $0.8125 per share for all accrued dividends at the redemption date. In settlement of the total redemption price of $51.1375 per share, Newmont issued to holders of record 1.9187 shares of its common stock. This redemption eliminated $7.5 million of annual preferred stock dividends prospectively. On April 26, 2002, Newmont filed post effective amendments to previous Registration Statements on Form S 3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the purpose of increasing its existing universal shelf registration from $500 million to $1.0 billion. This filing will provide the capability to access capital markets for debt or equity securities as required and as market conditions warrant. The Form S 3 has not yet been declared effective. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased $23.0 million, $52.3 million, $10.0 million and $30.9 million face amount of its outstanding 8 3/8%, 8 5/8%, NAL 7 1/2% and NAL 7 5/8% debentures, respectively, for total cash considerations of $135.8 million. Newmont recorded a pre tax charge of $19.6 million related to these repurchases during the first quarter of 2003. Environmental The Companys mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $268.2 million and $130.0 million, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 143, Asset Retirements Obligations (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements on page 67). In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk 75 Table of Contents profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Companys best estimate of its liability for these matters, $48.1 million and $55.7 million were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts are included in Other accrued liabilities and Reclamation and remediation liabilities. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 45% greater or 25% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2002. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Costs and expenses, Other in the period estimates are revised. For more information on the Companys reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in 2002 and 2001 capital expenditures was approximately $14.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Expenditures of $47.5 million are anticipated in 2003, primarily at Yanacocha. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of cash operating costs. Newmont spent $14.6 million, $8.1 million and $18.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former mining sites discussed in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and expects to spend approximately $14.4 million in 2003. 2002 expenditures relate primarily to the Dawn and Resurrection sites. In 2000, the remediation liability associated with the San Luis property in Colorado was increased $13.2 million. In June 2000, a transport contractor of Minera Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles southwest of the mine. Elemental mercury is a by product of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instruments and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Minera Yanacocha in response to the incident. In August 2000, Minera Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 soles (approximately $500,000) to the Peruvian government. Minera Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. In addition, it has entered into agreements with three of the communities impacted by this incident to provide a variety of public works as compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident. Costs of $13 million for public works, remediation efforts, personal compensation and the fine have been incurred for the Yanacocha spill to date. Neither the Company nor Minera Yanacocha can reasonably predict the likelihood of any additional expenditures related to this matter. Forward Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward Looking Statements in Item 1, Business, commencing on page 9. 76 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Metal Price Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; and global mine production levels. Based on estimates of Newmonts stand alone 2003 production and expenses, a $20 per ounce change in the gold price would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $107.5 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $87.5 million (about $0.21 per share) in net income. Changes in the market price of copper also affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow from its investment in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and its Golden Grove mine in Australia. Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. Based on estimates of Newmont stand alone 2003 production and expenses, a $0.10 per pound change in the copper price would result in an increase or decrease in net income of approximately $27.0 million (about $0.06 per share). Hedging Newmont generally sells its production at spot market prices. Newmont has historically, on a limited basis, entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold production and to manage risks associated with sales contracts, commodities, interest rates and foreign currency. In addition, at the time of Normandys acquisition, three of its affiliates had a substantial derivative instrument position. These three affiliates are now known as Newmont Gold Treasury Pty Ltd, the Newmont NFM, and Newmont Yandal Operations (NYOL). Following the Normandy acquisition, however, and in accordance with the Companys non gold hedging philosophy, efforts to proactively reduce and simplify the Normandy hedge positions have been undertaken. Accordingly, the Normandy gold hedge books have been reduced by approximately 3.3 million ounces since February 2002. Gold forward sales contracts and other instruments (committed hedging obligations) were reduced by 2,156,000 ounces since February 15, 2002 by delivering production into the contracts. Similarly, uncommitted contracts for 855,000 ounces were either delivered into or lapsed. In addition, 288,000 ounces of an overlaid position were closed out, leaving an open sold convertible put position of 240,000 ounces and an open bought call option position of 48,000 ounces. Combining the 2,156,000 committed ounces delivered, the 855,000 uncommitted ounces eliminated and the 288,000 ounces of overlaid positions closed out through December 31, 2002, the Normandy gold hedge books were reduced to 5.2 million committed ounces and 1.5 million uncommitted ounces for a total of 6.6 million ounces. The mark to market valuation of the Normandy gold hedge books at December 31, 2002, however, grew to a negative $433 million broken down as follows: Newmont Gold Treasury Pty Ltd: $(122) million; Newmont NFM: $(23) million; and, Newmont Yandal Operations Limited: $(288) million. The following table shows the approximate sensitivities of the US$ mark to market value of the Normandy gold hedge books to certain market variables as of December 31, 2002 (actual changes in the timing and amount of the following variables may differ from the assumed changes below): Market Variables Change in Variable Change in Mark to Market Value (millions) A$ Interest Rates +/ 1.0% /+$40.0 US$/A$ Exchange Rates +/ US$0.01 +/ $35.4 Gold Lease Rates +/ 1.0% +/ $15.2 US$ Interest Rates +/ 1.0% /+$10.5 US$ Gold Price/oz. +/ $1.00 /+$6.6 77 Table of Contents Newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. Credit risk is minimized by dealing only with major financial institutions/counterparties. A number of NYOLs hedge positions, however, are governed by agreements that confer on the relevant counterparties a right to terminate the position prior to its agreed scheduled maturity date. Such a termination would result in an immediate cash settlement of that contract based on the market value on the date of termination and could result in a cash settlement obligation to NYOL hedge counterparties in excess of available funds. NYOL obligations, however, are non recourse to Newmont and its other subsidiaries. The table below summarizes those NYOL contracts that are subject to rights to terminate and the mark to market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2002: Potential Termination Date (1) Ounces of Gold Fair Value at December 31, 2002 (in millions) January, 2003 (336,000 ) $ (5.1 ) January, 2004 (780,000 ) 11.8 June, 2004 (133,335 ) (10.4 ) April, 2005 (840,000 ) (31.0 ) May, 2005 (195,000 ) (15.7 ) June, 2005 30,000 (12.0 ) August, 2005 (1,304,997 ) (105.7 ) October, 2006 (13.0 )(2) Total (3,559,332 ) $ (181.1 ) (1) Earliest possible termination date permitted under the contract. (2) This position, which forms part of the US$/Gold swap contracts, is with a different counterparty than the original swap transaction and has no ounces associated with it. Effective January 1, 2001, Newmont adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to recognize derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measurement at fair value. Unless specific hedging criteria are met, changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized currently in earnings. Gains and losses on derivative hedging instruments are recorded in either Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax or Net income (loss), depending on the nature of the instrument. Gold Commodity Contracts The tables below are expressed in thousands of ounces of gold, and prices for contracts denominated in A$ have been translated to US$ at the exchange rate at December 31, 2002 of US$0.56 per A$1. For all floating rate instruments, the average prices quoted are gross contractual prices. The net forward prices ultimately realized on floating gold hedging contracts are the sum of the gross contractual forward prices less any associated future financing costs arising from gold borrowing commitments related to such floating rate instruments. Floating put option valuations include a deferred premium cost, which is payable in gold ounces upon expiration of the options. 78 Table of Contents Gold Forward Sales Contracts Newmont had the following gold forward sales contracts at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Gold Forward Sales Contracts: 2003 2004 2004 2005 Thereafter Total/ Average Fair Value US$ (000) (A$ Denominated) Fixed Forwards: Ounces 1,022 1,060 227 52 26 2,387 $ (138,095 ) Average price $ 297 $ 300 $ 293 $ 266 $ 254 $ 297 Floating Rate Forwards: Ounces 61 231 214 506 $ (37,401 ) Average price $ $ $ 332 $ 342 $ 352 $ 345 Synthetic Forwards: Ounces 39 80 80 80 160 439 $ (34,222 ) Average price $ 313 $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 $ 306 Total: Ounces 1,061 1,140 368 363 400 3,332 $ (209,717 ) Average Price $ 298 $ 300 $ 302 $ 323 $ 327 $ 305 Notes: Fixed forward sales contracts provide for delivery of a specified number of ounces at a specified price and date and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Floating rate forward contracts provide for a gold lease rate component in the price that takes into account market lease rates over the term of the contract. Gold lease rates reflect the borrowing cost for gold. Variations in gold lease rates have historically not materially impacted on the actual realized price achieved on the contract. As such, these contracts have been statistically proven to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under FAS 133. Synthetic forward contracts represent combinations of purchased put options and written call options at the same strike price, maturity date and number of ounces. The combination achieves the same risk management result as gold forward sales contracts. Both floating rate forwards and synthetic forwards are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Gold Put Option Contracts Newmont had the following gold put option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Fair Value Gold Put Option Contracts: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total/ Average US$ (000) US$ Denominated Fixed Purchased Puts: Ounces 209 203 205 100 20 737 $ (6,774 ) Average price $ 292 $ 292 $ 292 $ 338 $ 397 $ 301 A$ Denominated Fixed Purchased Puts: Ounces 91 88 49 228 $ (3,690 ) Average price $ 312 $ 318 $ 309 $ $ $ 314 A$ Denominated Floating Purchased Puts: Ounces 16 207 69 287 579 $ (12,140 ) Average price $ 316 $ $ 332 $ 342 $ 344 $ 338 Total: Ounces 316 291 461 169 307 1,544 $ (22,603 ) Average Price $ 299 $ 300 $ 312 $ 340 $ 347 $ 317 Notes: Fixed purchased put option contracts provide the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified number of ounces at a specified strike price and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Floating forward purchased put option contracts provide for a variable gold lease rate component in the strike price. These options are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Variations in gold lease rates have historically not materially impacted on the actual realized price achieved on the contract. As such, these contracts have been statistically proven to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under FAS 133. 79 Table of Contents Gold Convertible Put Options and Other Instruments Newmont had the following gold convertible put option contracts and other instruments outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Fair Value Gold Convertible Put Optionsand Other Instruments: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total/Average US$ (000) (A$ Denominated) Floating Convertible Put Options: Ounces 1,131 1,131 $ (102,952 ) Average price $ $ $ $ $ 376 $ 376 Knock out/knock in Contracts: Ounces 46 37 49 132 $ (6,794 ) Average price $ 311 $ 311 $ 311 $ $ $ 311 Indexed Forward Contracts: Ounces 33 65 98 196 $ (15,740 ) Average price $ $ $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 Total: Ounces 46 37 82 65 1,229 1,459 $ (125,486 ) Average price $ 311 $ 311 $ 308 $ 305 $ 371 $ 361 Notes: Convertible put option contracts and other instruments are composed of: a) Convertible option contracts that provide minimum price protection for covered ounces, while providing the opportunity to participate in higher market prices under certain market conditions, and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. (These contracts have a floating lease rate component. Variations in gold lease rates have historically not materially impacted on the actual realized price achieved on the contract. As such, these contracts have been statistically proven to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under FAS 133); b) Knock out/knock in option contracts are contingent sold call options that either terminate (or knock out) and maintain upside gold price potential or convert (or knock in) to sold call options, depending on certain market conditions, and are marked to market, with the change reflected in income; and c) Indexed forward contracts that are potentially convertible to purchased put options, depending on the market gold price at set future value dates during the term of the contract, and are marked to market, with the change reflected in income. Gold Sold Convertible Put Options Newmont had the following gold convertible put option contracts and other instruments outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Fair Value Gold Sold Convertible Put Options: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total/ Average US$ (000) (A$ Denominated) Ounces 30 60 60 90 240 $ (14,295 ) Average price $ $ 331 $ 334 $ 337 $ 340 $ 337 Notes: Sold convertible put options are contracts that commit Newmont to buy gold ounces under certain market conditions at a predetermined price on a specified future date. At December 31, 2002 Newmont had a sold gold convertible put position of 240,000 ounces. This position was originally overlaid with a bought convertible put position, however, the bought position was closed out during the year. As the contracts are to buy gold, they cannot be treated as cash flow hedges; they are therefore marked to market with the change reflected in income. The cash flow on the close out of this bought position was an outflow of $10.9 million. 80 Table of Contents Price Capped Sales Contracts Newmont had the following price capped forward sales contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Total/ Average Fair Value US$ (000) Price capped contracts: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter (US$ Denominated) Ounces 500 1,850 2,350 n/a Average price $ $ $ 350 $ $ 384 $ 377 US$/Gold Swap Contracts Newmont Australia entered into a US$/gold swap contract whereby principal payments on US$ bonds are swapped into gold denominated payments of 600,000 ounces in 2008. Newmont Australia also receives US$ fixed interest payments and pays gold lease rates, which are indexed to spot prices. This instrument is marked to market at each period end, with the change reflected in income, and at December 31, 2002, the fair value was a negative $87.2 million. Other Sales Contracts, Commodity and Derivative Instruments Foreign Currency In addition to the U.S., Newmont has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Uzbekistan, Bolivia and Turkey. To the extent that there are fluctuations in local currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, the devaluation of a local currency is generally economically neutral or beneficial to most operations since local salaries and supply contracts will decrease against the U.S. dollar based revenue stream. The appreciation of non U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar can increase the costs of gold production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States, making such mines less profitable. Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) were $14.0 million, $(5.1) million and $(6.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Newmont acquired certain cross currency swap contracts in the Normandy transaction intended to hedge the currency risk on repayment of US$ denominated debt. These contracts were closed out during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 for net proceeds of $50.8 million. The contracts were accounted for on a mark to market basis until closed out, resulting in a loss to income of $8.5 million for the period from February 15, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Newmont also acquired currency swap contracts to receive A$ and pay US$ designated as hedges of A$ denominated debt. The A$ denominated debt was repaid during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and the contracts are currently undesignated. The contracts are accounted for on a mark to market basis. At December 31, 2002, they had a negative fair value of $21.9 million. At December 31, 2002, Newmont had the following foreign currency contracts outstanding. Prices for contracts denominated in A$ have been translated at the exchange rate at December 31, 2002 of US$0.56 per A$1. A$/US$ CurrencyExchange Contracts: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Total/ Average Fair Value US$ (000) 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Notional Amounts US$ (000) $ 45,390 $ 56,112 $ 30,700 $ $ $ 132,201 $ (21,924 ) Average Exchange Rate (US$ per A$1) Average price 0.645 0.646 0.682 0.654 Interest Rate Swap Contracts In the Normandy transaction, Newmont acquired A$125 million of interest rate swap contracts covering a portion of its US$100 million, 7 year bonds. These contracts were closed out during the quarter ended 81 Table of Contents June 30, 2002 for a net cash out flow of $1 million. The contracts were accounted for on a mark to market basis until closed out, resulting in a gain of $0.4 million for the period from February 15, 2002 through December 31, 2002. During the last half of 2001, Newmont entered into contracts to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its $275 million 8.625% notes and its $200 million 8.375% debentures. Newmont receives fixed rate interest payments at 8.625% and 8.375% and pays floating rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 4.25%. The notional principal amount of these transactions (representing the amount of principal tied to floating interest rate exposure) was $200 million at December 31, 2002. Half of these contracts expire in July 2005 and half expire in May 2011. These transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $5.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These transactions have been designated as fair value hedges and had a positive fair value of $13.8 million at December 31, 2002 and a negative fair value of $0.6 million at December 31, 2001. Fixed Rate Debt Newmont has both fixed and variable rate debt. Without considering the specialized $145 million Prepaid Forward Sales Obligation, 93% and 90% of debt was fixed and 7% and 10% was variable at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has managed some of its fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (See Interest Rate Swap Contracts above). The Companys fixed rate debt exposure at December 31, 2002 and 2001 is summarized as follows: 2002 2001 (in millions) Carrying value of fixed rate debt* $ 976 $ 755 Fair value of fixed rate debt* $ 1,075 $ 766 Pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/ 10 basis point interest rate change** $ +/ 3.7 $ +/ 2.8 * Excludes specialized and hybrid debt instruments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. These instruments include the Sale Leaseback of the Refractory Ore Treatment Plant, Newmont Yandal 8 7/8% notes, Prepaid Forward Sales Obligation, Minera Yanacocha Trust Certificates and certain capital leases. The estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. ** The pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. Actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont or the Company). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. References to A$ refer to Australian currency, CDN$ to Canadian currency and US$ or $ to United States Currency. Accounting Changes During the third quarter of 2002, Newmont changed its accounting policy, retroactive to January 1, 2002, with respect to depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of Property, Plant and Equipment to exclude future estimated development costs expected to be incurred for certain underground operations. Previously, the Company had included these costs and associated reserves in its DD&A calculations at certain of its underground mining operations. In addition, the Company further revised its policy such that costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that area are depreciated, depleted or amortized over the reserves associated with the specific ore area. These changes were made to better match DD&A with the associated ounces of gold sold and to remove the inherent uncertainty in estimating future development costs in arriving at DD&A rates. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle through December 31, 2001 increased net income during the year ended December 31, 2002 by $7.7 million, net of tax of $4.1 million, and increased net income per share by $0.02. The effect of the change in 2002 was to increase DD&A expense by $1.3 million and decrease net income by $0.8 million for the year. If the change had been in effect for 2001 and 2000, the pro forma effect of the change would have reduced DD&A expense by $2.0 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and would have decreased the net loss by $1.3 million and $0.6 million for the same periods. There was no pro forma impact to earnings per share in either 2001 or 2000. Restructuring On February 13, 2002, Newmont stockholders approved adoption of an Agreement and Plan of Merger that provided for a restructuring of Newmont to facilitate the February 2002 acquisitions described below and to create a flexible corporate structure. Newmont merged with an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary that resulted in Newmont (or Old Newmont) becoming a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed holding company. The new holding company, previously a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Newmont, was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Newmont as a result of this restructuring and former stockholders of Old Newmont became stockholders of the new holding company. Old Newmont was subsequently renamed Newmont USA Limited. Mergers and Acquisitions Normandy Mining Limited and Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited On February 16, 2002, pursuant to a Canadian Plan of Arrangement, Newmont acquired 100% of Franco Nevada Mining Corporation Limited (Franco Nevada) in a stock for stock transaction in which Franco Nevada common stockholders received 0.8 of a share of Newmont common stock, or 0.8 of a Canadian exchangeable share (exchangeable for Newmont common), for each common share of Franco Nevada. The exchangeable shares are substantially equivalent to Newmont common shares. On February 20, 2002, Newmont obtained control of Normandy Mining Limited (Normandy) through a tender offer for all of the ordinary shares of Normandy. For accounting purposes, the effective date of the Normandy acquisition was the close of business on February 15, 2002, when Newmont received an irrevocable tender from shareholders for more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Normandy. Accordingly, the results of operations of Normandy and Franco Nevada have been included in the accompanying financial statements from February 16, 2002 forward. On February 26, 2002, 48 Table of Contents when the tender offer for Normandy expired, Newmont controlled more than 96% of Normandys outstanding shares. Newmont exercised its rights to acquire the remaining shares of Normandy in April 2002. Consideration paid for Normandy included 3.85 shares of Newmont common stock for every 100 ordinary shares of Normandy (including ordinary shares represented by American depository receipts) plus A$0.50 per Normandy share, or the U.S. dollar equivalent of that amount for Normandy stockholders outside Australia. Normandy was Australias largest gold company with interests in 16 development stage or operating mining properties worldwide. Franco Nevada was the worlds leading precious minerals royalty company and had interests in other investments in the mining industry. Following the February 2002 acquisitions, Normandy was renamed Newmont Australia Limited (NAL) and Franco Nevada was renamed Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited. The purchase price for these acquisitions totaled $4.3 billion, composed of 197.0 million Newmont shares (or share equivalents), $461.7 million in cash and approximately $90.3 million of direct costs. The value of Newmont shares (or share equivalents) was $19.01 per share based on the average market price of the shares over the two day period before and after January 2, 2002, the last trading day before the final and revised terms for the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions were announced. The combination of Newmont, Normandy and Franco Nevada was designed to create a platform for growth and for delivering superior returns to shareholders. With a larger global operating base, a broad and balanced portfolio of development projects and a stable income stream from mineral royalties and investments, the combined company will have opportunities to optimize returns, realize synergies through rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration programs, realize operating efficiencies, reduce operating and procurement costs and reduce interest expense and income taxes. The acquisitions resulted in approximately $3.0 billion of goodwill primarily related to the merchant banking business, the combined global exploration programs and expertise, and the synergies discussed above. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair market values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over such fair value was recorded as goodwill. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill was assigned to specific reporting units. Goodwill and other identifiable intangibles not subject to amortization will be reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently when an event or change in circumstances indicates that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. In conjunction with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2002, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation for the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions. The final purchase price allocation resulted in an increase in goodwill from approximately $2.6 billion to approximately $3.0 billion. We anticipate synergies from our business combination with Normandy and Franco Nevada to exceed $75 million annually starting in 2003. Such synergies are being and will be obtained from the rationalization of corporate overhead and exploration and development budgets, as well as operating efficiencies and cost reductions associated with procurement, interest and tax benefits. Battle Mountain Gold Company On January 10, 2001, Newmont completed a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company (Battle Mountain) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated June 21, 2000, under which each share of common stock of Battle Mountain and each exchangeable share of Battle Mountain Canada Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Battle Mountain) was converted into the right to receive 0.105 share of Newmont, or approximately 24.1 million shares. Newmont also exchanged 2.3 million shares of newly issued $3.25 convertible preferred stock for all outstanding shares of Battle Mountain $3.25 convertible preferred stock. The 49 Table of Contents merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and as such, the Consolidated Financial Statements include Battle Mountains financial data as if Battle Mountain had always been part of Newmont. During 2001, Newmont successfully integrated the former Battle Mountain operations in Canada and Bolivia, the Phoenix development project in Nevada, and its interest in the Pajingo joint venture operation in Australia. Synergies in excess of the estimated $25 million, pre tax, were achieved during 2001 from consolidation of administrative and exploration staffs, purchasing economies and application of Gold Medal Performance, Newmonts internal process improvement program. The Phoenix project will provide an opportunity for additional synergies in future years from utilization of existing nearby processing facilities. Summary Newmont recorded net income to common shares of $154.3 million ($0.42 per share, basic) for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with net losses to common shares of $54.1 million ($0.28 per share) and $97.2 million ($0.51 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Results for 2002 included, after tax, a non cash unrealized mark to market loss on derivatives of $38.3 million ($0.10 per share), a $30.7 million ($0.08 per share) gain on the sale of marketable securities of Lihir, $31.3 million ($0.08 per share) for asset write downs, $10.2 million ($0.03 per share) for prior period income tax benefits and a $7.7 million ($0.02 per share) gain for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results for 2001 included after tax, $43.7 million ($0.22 per share) for restructuring and Battle Mountain merger expenses, $37.6 million ($0.19 per share) for asset write downs, $24.8 million ($0.13 per share) for prior period income tax benefits, $3.3 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses and $1.1 million for a gain on written call options. Results in 2000 included after tax, non cash charges of $49.3 million ($0.26 per share) for asset write downs, $27.4 million ($0.14 per share) for expenses associated with an acquisition settlement, $23.9 million ($0.12 per share) for losses on marketable securities, a $12.6 million ($0.06 per share) loss for the cumulative effect of accounting changes for revenue recognition, $12.4 million ($0.06 per share) for amortization of put option premiums and $4.0 million ($0.02 per share) for foreign currency exchange losses. Also included were after tax charges of $6.9 million ($0.04 per share) for merger expenses and a non cash unrealized mark to market gain on call option contracts of $17.4 million ($0.09 per share). As a largely unhedged company, Newmonts average realized gold price of $313, $271 and $282 per equity ounce sold in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, closely tracked the spot market price. At December 31, 2002, approximately 10.3% of Newmonts proven and probable reserves were subject to derivative contracts. At December 31, 2001, less than 4% of Newmonts proven and probable reserves were subject to derivative contracts. In 2002, gold sales increased to 7.63 million equity ounces (ounces attributable to Newmonts ownership or economic interest), compared to 5.47 million and 5.76 million equity ounces in 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily from additional production from the operations acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition. Total cash costs of production were $189 per ounce in 2002, $184 per ounce in 2001 and $170 per ounce in 2000. As a result of increased production and higher average realized gold prices, cash flow from operations increased to $670.3 million in 2002 from $369.7 million in 2001 and $534.3 million in 2000. Long term debt, net of cash balances, was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2002 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2001. Gold reserves at December 31, 2002 totaled 86.9 contained equity ounces (including Newmonts then equity interest in TVX Newmont Americas and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. (Echo Bay)) compared with 87.3 million ounces at December 31, 2001 on a pro forma basis including the reserves of Normandy. Reserve calculations for 2002 and 2001 were based on a gold price assumption of $300 per ounce. Newmonts reserves, excluding the reserves of the TVX Newmont Americas and Echo Bay that were sold in early 2003, would decline 50 Table of Contents to 74.8 million ounces at December 31, 2002 based on a gold price assumption of $275 per ounce and would increase to 89.3 million ounces with a price assumption of $325 per ounce. In 2002, copper sales totaled 408.0 million equity pounds (pounds attributable to Newmonts economic interest), compared with 360.0 million and 294.2 million equity pounds in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs were $0.34, $0.37 and $0.59 per equity pound, after gold and silver sales credits, for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The average realized price in 2002 was $0.73 per pound, compared with $0.70 and $0.82 per pound in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Proven and probable reserves totaled 7.6 billion contained equity pounds of copper at December 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of Newmonts Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most critical accounting principles upon which Newmonts financial status depends are those requiring estimates of proven and probable reserves, recoverable ounces therefrom, and or assumptions of future gold prices. Such estimates and assumptions affect the value of inventories (which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value), the potential impairment of long lived assets, and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. Other significant assumptions that affect the Companys estimates regarding impairments of long lived assets and the realizable amounts of deferred tax assets are estimated future production costs and capital expenditures. Estimates of proven and probable reserves, as well as estimates of the useful lives of buildings and equipment, also affect the rate at which depreciation, depletion and amortization are charged to earnings. In addition, management has estimated future costs associated with reclamation of mining properties as well as remediation costs for inactive properties. The Companys portfolio of derivatives includes complex gold and other instruments. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair values of such instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding gold and other commodity prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates. Management also applies considerable judgment to determining whether losses from environmental, legal and other contingencies are probable, and if so, how much to accrue for each contingency. Management engaged independent appraisers to assist in the allocation of the purchase price of Normandy and Franco Nevada to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their fair values; the determination of such fair values were dependent upon assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows from each acquired mining operation and other factors, including the Companys ability and intent to renew mining leases where the remaining term on the current lease is not sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and probable reserves and undeveloped mineral interests. Furthermore, the Company allocated the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets (i.e. goodwill) to reporting units based upon independent appraisals. This allocation was primarily based upon assumptions regarding the ability of Normandys exploration program to continue to make discoveries consistent with historical results, the ability of Newmont Capital to continue to engage in mergers, acquisitions and other deals to enhance shareholder value consistent with historical results and the ability of the Company to realize certain synergies at specific mining operations. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations Equity Ozs.

Certain gold mines produce silver as a by product. Proceeds from the sale of by products are reflected as credits to total cash costs. All of these charges and by product credits are included in Costs applicable to sales. Charges for reclamation are also included in Costs applicable to sales, but are not included in total cash costs. Reclamation charges are included in total production costs, together with total cash costs and Depreciation, depletion and amortization. A reconciliation of total cash costs to Costs applicable to sales in total and by segment is provided in Item 2, Properties, Operating Statistics on page 30. Total production costs provide an indication of earnings before interest expense and taxes for Newmonts share of gold 52 Table of Contents mining properties, when taking into account the average realized price received for gold sold, as this measure combines Costs applicable to sales plus Depreciation, depletion and amortization, net of minority interest. Disclosure of total cash costs per ounce is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities of these mining operations. Newmonts management uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its gold mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. This measure was developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmonts measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See the reconciliation of Costs applicable to sales to total cash costs and total production costs per ounce (unaudited) on page 30. North American Operations Newmonts Nevada operations are along the Carlin Trend near Elko and in the Winnemucca region, where the Twin Creeks mine and the Lone Tree Complex are located. Nevada operations also include the Midas underground mine (acquired in February 2002). Nevadas gold sales in 2002 of 2.72 million ounces were 1% higher than in 2001. Total cash costs at Nevada also increased slightly from $222 per ounce in 2001 to $225 per ounce in 2002. The Midas mine, acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition, contributed approximately 196,200 ounces of production in 2002, or approximately 7% of Nevadas production. Without the Midas production, Nevada gold sales would have declined about 6.5% in 2002 compared to 2001. This resulted from (i) less oxide mill throughput in 2002 due to the shutdown of the Pinon Mill; (ii) utilization of lower grade oxide stockpiles resulting in lower recoveries in most oxide mills; and (iii) a 38.5% decline in tons placed on the leach pads due to mining more mill grade material and the postponement of production from Gold Quarry South Layback project until 2003. These trends were largely offset by increased throughput in the refractory mills from better utilization of the Carlin Roaster and the Twin Creeks Sage Mill and a 3% increase in refractory grade. Nevadas sales of 2.7 million ounces in 2001 were 11% lower than in 2000, with the depletion of the Deep Post surface deposit early in 2001 resulting in approximately 300,000 fewer high grade, low cost open pit ounces produced during 2001 than during 2000. This also caused total cash costs to increase to $222 per ounce in 2001 from $203 per ounce in 2000. Approximately 139 million tons of material were mined from surface open pits in 2001, down 31% from 2000. Refractory ore treatment facilities, with higher processing costs than oxide ore mills, generated 65% of Nevadas production in 2001, as compared to 68% in 2000. Sales and total cash costs in 2003 are expected to be 2.55 million ounces and $215 per ounce, respectively. The projected 6% decline in production in 2003 is due to expected lower recovery from the Carlin Roaster as a result of expected drawdowns of lower grade stockpiles and increased stripping at Twin Creeks. Total cash costs at Nevada are expected to decline by $10 per ounce partially reflecting reduced royalties due to a full year of benefit from acquiring the Nevada royalties formerly held by Franco Nevada and increased silver by product credits. Gold sales at the Mesquite heap leach mine in southern California decreased 38% to 57,100 ounces in 2002, and total cash costs per ounce decreased to $177 in 2002 from $205 in 2001, reflecting the full impact of the cessation of mining activities and the depletion of the ore body in 2001. Gold sales fell 29% to 92,600 ounces in 2001 from 130,300 ounces in 2000. Total cash costs per ounce also decreased 7% to $205 per ounce in 2001 from $221 per ounce in 2000. Mining activities ceased in the second quarter of 2001 with the depletion of the ore body, and selected equipment from the Mesquite mine was transferred to operations in South America and in Nevada. Gold sales from continued declining recovery of gold from heap leach pads of about 35,000 ounces at $160 total cash costs per ounce are expected in 2003. Final gold production from inventories on the leach pads is expected in 2004. At La Herradura, a 44% owned, heap leach operation in Sonora, Mexico not operated by the Company, Newmonts equity share of 2002 sales totaled 64,200 ounces at a total cash cost of $176 per ounce, compared to 54,700 ounces at $173 per ounce in 2001 and 50,500 ounces at $131 per ounce in 2000. Gold sales in 2003 are expected to total approximately 75,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost of $157 per ounce. 53 Table of Contents Production sold from the Golden Giant underground mine in Ontario, Canada amounted to 281,500 ounces at total cash costs of $196 per ounce in 2002, compared to 283,700 ounces at $187 and 406,600 ounces at $146 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Despite similar sales volumes in 2002 compared to 2001, total cash costs per ounce increased in 2002 reflecting increased electricity rates, mining costs expensed for ongoing development, increased ground support and maintenance costs and appreciation of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Ounces sold decreased and total cash costs per ounce increased from 2000 to 2001 primarily due to lower grade ore. This maturing mine is projected to experience diminishing mining fronts, smaller size stopes, increasing stopes being mined simultaneously and more labor intensive mining techniques in 2003, leading to projected gold ounces sold of approximately 200,000 ounces at $252 total cash costs per ounce. The Holloway underground mine in Ontario, Canada is an 84.65% owned joint venture with Teddy Bear Valley Mines. In 2002, gold sales totaled 97,700 equity ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $204, compared to 89,400 ounces at a total cash cost of $209 in 2001 and 83,400 ounces at $229 per ounce in 2000. The upward trend in ounces sold from 2000 to 2002 primarily reflects increasing mill throughput in each year from surface secondary crushing and drawdowns of inventories in 2002. The decrease in cash costs in 2002 is primarily from increased production. Holloway is expected to sell approximately 75,000 equity ounces at $255 total cash costs per ounce in 2003. The expected decrease in ounces sold and increase in cash costs per ounce in 2003 result from production of lower grade ore due to stope sequencing and depleted in process inventories. South American Operations Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (Yanacocha) in Peru is 51.35% owned and includes five open pit mines, four leach pads, two gold recovery plants and a crushing and agglomeration facility. Gold sales were a record 2.29 million ounces (1.18 million equity ounces) in 2002, 20% higher than 2001. Total cash costs per ounce of $125 were up 9% from 2001 primarily due to lower grade ore and more production coming from the higher cost La Quinua operation that requires crushing and agglomeration unlike other Minera Yanacocha ore bodies, partially offset by economies of scale resulting from higher production levels. In 2001, Yanacocha achieved sales of 1.91 million ounces (983,100 equity ounces), a 9% increase from 1.76 million ounces (901,200 equity ounces) in 2000. Total cash costs of $115 per ounce in 2001 were lower than 2002 because of low waste to ore ratios and porous ore that yielded high gold recoveries without crushing prior to heap leaching. Total cash costs of $87 per ounce in 2000 resulted primarily from waste to ore ratios lower than 2001 and slightly higher grade ore. Production at Yanacocha has grown annually through the discovery and development of additional reserves and increased mining and processing capacity. Without adding new mining equipment, Yanacocha reached a mining rate of 600,000 tons per day in the fourth quarter of 2002. Yanacocha mined approximately 204 million tons of material (149 million ore tons and 55 million waste tons) in 2002, compared to approximately 156 million tons (85 million ore tons and 71 million waste tons) in 2001 and 132 million tons (83 million ore tons and 49 million waste tons) in 2000. Yanacochas first crushing and agglomeration facility, for the La Quinua deposit, started up late in the third quarter of 2001 and continued to undergo commissioning adjustments through the first half of 2002, gradually stepping up to its design rate of 132,000 tons per day (120,000 metric tons per day). Yanacocha is expected to sell approximately 2.5 million ounces (1.3 million equity ounces) of gold in 2003 at total cash costs per ounce of $115 to $120. The Kori Kollo open pit mine in Bolivia is owned by Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., in which Newmont has an 88% interest. Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado owns the remaining 12% interest. Equity gold ounces sold in 2002 totaled 249,400 ounces, compared to 274,800 and 247,700 equity ounces in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce were $156 in 2002, compared to $158 and $200 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Production declined in 2002 primarily from processing lower grade ore through the mill. Production increased and cash costs per ounce decreased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the introduction of a new heap leach operation and improved mill performance. Equity ounces sold in 2003 are expected to total approximately 125,000 ounces at total cash costs of $240 per ounce. Kori Kollo is a mature mine. The pit will be mined out in the first half of 2003 with closure of the mill later in the year. Leach production will continue thereafter until the oxide ore stockpiles are depleted. 54 Table of Contents Australian Operations Information related to Australian operations for 2002 reflects activity from February 16, 2002 (as the Normandy acquisition was effective February 15, 2002) through December 31, 2002, with the exception of Pajingo, which was 50% owned by Newmont prior to the acquisition of Normandy. For 2002, equity gold sales at the 50% owned Kalgoorlie mine in Western Australia totaled 324,700 ounces at total cash costs of $215 per ounce. Cash costs per ounce for 2002 were higher than anticipated due to continued mining at Mt. Charlotte, an underground mine just north of the Super Pit, and higher milling costs resulting from the treatment of lower grade material. For 2003, gold sales at Kalgoorlie are expected to total 340,000 equity ounces at a total cash cost per ounce of $275. Equity ounces sold are expected to increase in 2003 because Newmont will own its interest for the full year 2003, compared to 10.5 months in 2002, partially offset by reduced throughput and lower recoveries. Cash costs per ounce are expected to rise in 2003 due to the lower production and an increase in the A$ exchange rate. The joint venture owners have commissioned a program that is currently evaluating operating initiatives to improve Kalgoorlies cost structure. At the Yandal operations, which consist of the Bronzewing, Jundee and Wiluna mines in Western Australia, gold sales for 2002 were 611,100 equity ounces at total cash costs of $215 per ounce. A shortfall of ounces sold at Bronzewing occurred in 2002 due to a 14% lower than expected mill feed grade, lower than budgeted tons milled and a shortfall in underground ore production. Bronzewing cash costs were higher than budgeted due primarily to higher mining costs from the one time cost of transitioning to owner mining during the period. Gold sales at the Jundee property were below budget due to lower production, a result of mining in lower grade underground stopes in the third quarter and increased quantities of lower grade regional ore processed throughout the year. Cash costs per ounce at Jundee were consistent with the Companys expectations, with the effects of lower production being offset by lower operating costs due to lower mining volumes and underground development achieved by the new mining contractor. An agreement for the sale of Wiluna was signed during the year, which has since expired. The existing Wiluna reserves are expected to be depleted within one year. Yandal gold sales in 2003 are expected to total 640,000 equity ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $257 per ounce. Equity ounces sold are expected to increase in 2003 due to the Yandal operations being accounted for over a full year, partially offset by a reduction in head grade at Jundee due to the blending of low grade stockpiles during the year, and 10% lower than anticipated throughput at Bronzewing as current reserves are depleted pending mine closure in early 2004. Cash costs per ounce are projected to rise in 2003 as a direct result of the expected lower production, a higher A$ exchange rate and a higher allocation of corporate costs. Newmont Yandal Operations Limited (NYOL), the Newmont subsidiary that owns the Yandal operations, has a substantial derivatives position. At December 31, 2002, NYOLs hedge positions had a mark to market valuation of negative $288 million. A number of NYOLs hedge positions are governed by agreements that confer on the relevant counterparties a right to terminate the position prior to its agreed scheduled maturity date. Such a termination would require an immediate cash settlement of that contract based on the market value on the date of termination and could result in a cash settlement obligation to NYOL hedge counterparties in excess of available funds. NYOL also has outstanding $300 million (of which Newmont owns $62.8 million) of ten year 8 7/8% senior unsecured notes due in 2008. NYOLs liabilities represent a significant challenge to NYOL, and while these liabilities are non recourse to Newmont and its other subsidiaries, should NYOL become bankrupt or insolvent, there could be loss or liquidation of NYOLs assets including the Bronzewing, Jundee and Wiluna mines, which had proven and probable reserves of 2.1 million ounces as of December 31, 2002. Newmont controls a significant land position through its control of Newmont NFM (Normandy NFM Limited trading as Newmont NFM) and Otter Gold Mines Limited (Otter Mines) in the highly prospective Tanami gold district. For 2002, the Tanami operations in the Northern Territory (approximately an 85.9% interest) sold 452,400 equity ounces at total cash costs per ounce of $205. Equity gold sales at Tanami were higher than expected reflecting higher production due to higher than expected grades and recoveries, partially offset by lower mill throughput. Cash costs per ounce were higher than expected due to additional milling and maintenance costs resulting from abrasive ore from the Groundrush mine, partially offset by the impacts of 55 Table of Contents higher production. Tanami is expected to sell about 600,000 equity ounces in 2003 at total cash costs per ounce of $215. The increase in projected equity ounces sold is partially attributable to the plan to acquire the remaining minority interests in Newmont NFM (see Production Properties at page 21). The increase is also attributable to the mining of higher grade stopes at the Granites and additional recoveries and higher grades of ore mined at Groundrush, along with a full year contribution from Newmont NFM. Cash costs per ounce are expected to rise in 2003 due to deeper mining and additional crushing costs at Groundrush, partially offset by the impact of the higher production at the Granites. Cash costs are also expected to be impacted by a higher $A exchange rate and a higher allocation of corporate costs. At the Pajingo mine in north Queensland, gold sales for 2002 were 296,400 equity ounces at cash costs per ounce of $95, compared to 126,000 and 112,100 equity ounces at cash costs of $105 and $99 per ounce in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in ounces sold in 2002 is primarily from Newmonts interest in the operation increasing to 100% from 50% in prior years due to the acquisition of Normandy. Sales also increased from higher production due to higher grade ore in 2002. Cash costs per ounce declined in 2002 reflecting the impact of a full year of owner mining. Increased sales from 2000 and 1999 resulted from production increases due to the completion of a mill expansion project in 1999. Gold sales in 2003 are projected to total approximately 345,000 ounces with cash costs of $110 per ounce. The increase in gold sales at Pajingo is due to higher throughput and grades and the impact of having 100% ownership for most of the year. Cash costs are expected to increase due to the impact of a higher A$ exchange rate and a higher allocation of corporate costs. Other Mining Operations Information related to Martha, Ovacik, Golden Grove and TVX Newmont Americas for 2002 reflects activity from February 16, 2002 (as the Normandy acquisition was effective February 15, 2002) through December 31, 2002. Information related to Echo Bay for 2002 reflects activity from April 3, 2002 (the date Newmonts investment was converted from capital debt securities to common shares of Echo Bay) through December 31, 2002. Information for all other properties in 2002 reflects activity from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002. The Zarafshan Newmont Joint Venture, in the Central Asian Republic of Uzbekistan, is a 50/50 joint venture between Newmont and two Uzbekistan government entities, the State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources (the State Committee) and Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combinat (Navoi). Gold sales in 2002 totaled 511,600 ounces (255,800 equity ounces) compared to 444,000 ounces (222,000 equity ounces) in 2001 and 502,800 ounces (251,400 equity ounces) in 2000. Gold sales increased in 2002 due to higher grade ore placed on the leach pads. Total cash costs of $134 per ounce in 2002 were consistent with the $136 per ounce in 2001. Total cash costs increased in 2001 from $129 per ounce in 2000. Zarafshan Newmont is expected to sell approximately 210,000 equity ounces in 2003 at cash costs per ounce of $152. Zarafshan Newmont produces gold by crushing and leaching ore from existing stockpiles of low grade oxide ore from the nearby government owned Murantau mine. The State Committee and Navoi furnish ore to Zarafshan Newmont under an ore supply agreement. Under the agreement, the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to deliver 220 million metric tons of ore to Zarafshan Newmont. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 98.1 million metric tons of ore have been delivered, leaving a balance of 121.9 million metric tons. Initially, under the agreement, ore was to be delivered regardless of the gold price and the price of the ore was dependent on the grade of ore delivered. In 2000, however, the ore supply agreement was amended to modify the required grades and pricing structure. Under the 2000 amendment, the grade of ore that the State Committee and Navoi are obligated to provide is dependent on the forecasted gold price as determined by the board of directors of Zarafshan Newmont, and the price is dependent on the average gold price during the period the ore is processed. Thus at higher gold prices, the State Committee and Navoi may deliver lower grade ore, but receive a higher price. In October 2002, the parties reached tentative agreement to further amend the ore supply agreement. Under the new amendment, the pricing terms for approximately 99.5 million metric tons of the remaining 121.9 million metric tons will be determined by a formula whereby the amount paid for ore is 56 Table of Contents dependent on the average grade of ore and the average gold price during the period which the ore is processed. At certain combinations of ore grade and gold price, the computed price may result in a credit to Zarafshan Newmont which will be offset against future ore purchase payments or free cash flow distributions to Navoi and the State Committee. At Minahasa, in Indonesia, Newmont has an 80% interest but is attributed a greater percent of the gold production until it recoups the bulk of its investment including interest. Prior to November 2001, Newmont was attributed 100% of Minahasas gold production and subsequently 94%, as Newmont recouped some of its investment through the collection of funds in accordance with existing loan agreements. Equity gold ounces sold decreased to 147,200 ounces in 2002, compared to 341,500 and 354,200 equity ounces in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce were $218 in 2002, compared to $142 and $133 per ounce in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Production declined and costs increased in 2002 primarily due to processing lower grade ore. Mining activities ceased late in 2001; however, it is expected that processing of the remaining stockpiles will continue until the fourth quarter of 2004. Sales in 2003 are expected to be approximately 90,000 equity ounces, with total cash costs of approximately $239 per ounce. Equity sales at the Martha mine in New Zealand were 107,800 ounces in 2002 with total cash costs of $156 per equity ounce. Newmont acquired Martha as part of the Normandy acquisition. The mine is a joint venture between Newmont (67% ownership) and Otter Mines (33% ownership). Newmont NFM, owned 85.9% by Newmont, in turn owns over 90% of Otter Mines. Through separate transactions, Newmont is currently in the process of acquiring the minority interests of both Newmont NFM and Otter Mines, to give it 100% ownership in Martha (see Production Properties at page 21). We anticipate Martha will sell approximately 100,000 equity ounces of gold in 2003 at total cash costs of $188 per ounce. The wholly owned Ovacik mine near the Aegean Sea in western Turkey (acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition on February 15, 2002) sold 125,700 equity ounces of gold at total cash costs of $122 per ounce. Newmont expects Ovacik to sell approximately 130,000 equity ounces of gold at total cash costs of $165 per ounce in 2003. The increase in expected total cash costs per ounce in 2003 at Ovacik is primarily attributable to an increased proportion of higher cost underground mining compared to 2002. At the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia, copper sales totaled 362.3 million equity pounds (pounds attributable to Newmonts economic interest) in 2002, compared to 360.0 million and 294.2 million equity pounds in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash costs were $0.31, $0.37 and $0.59 per equity pound, after gold and silver by product credits, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Newmont holds an indirect 45% equity interest in the mine, but is attributed 56.25% of production until recouping the bulk of its investment, including interest. Net cash costs declined in 2002 compared to 2001 as operational improvements and the addition of a pebble crushing circuit added process throughput capacity, partially offset by lower grade ore. Gold sales, accounted for as by product credits, totaled 278,000, 295,100 and 178,400 equity ounces for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys equity income from Batu Hijau includes gold and silver revenues that are credited against costs applicable to sales as by product credits in the determination of net income for each period presented in the Statements of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). These by product credits represented 44%, 42% and 27% of revenues and reduced production costs by 58%, 48% and 28% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Such by product credits are expected to continue while ore is being processed which, based on current engineering models, is estimated to be through the end of 2020. These by product credits are expected to vary from time to time and are significant to the economics of the Batu Hijau operation. At current copper prices, the Batu Hijau operation would not be profitable without these credits. The improvement in 2002 net cash costs per equity pound was also partially attributable to higher gold prices during the year, which resulted in higher by product credits. Sales in 2003 are expected to total approximately 340 to 360 million equity pounds of copper and 270,000 equity ounces of gold. Total cash costs per equity pound of copper in 2003 are expected to be approximately $0.28 to $0.30. The wholly owned Golden Grove copper/zinc operation in Western Australia, which was acquired as part of the Normandy acquisition, sold 45.7 million pounds of copper and 148.0 million pounds of zinc in 2002 at total 57 Table of Contents cash costs of $0.56 and $0.18 per pound, respectively. TVX Newmont Americas was 49.9% owned by Newmont and 50.1% owned by TVX Gold Inc. and was treated as an equity investment for reporting purposes in 2002. The principal assets of TVX Newmont Americas are interests in operating gold mines in South America (Paracatu, Crixas and La Coipa) and Canada (Musselwhite and New Britannia). Sales for 2002 were 183,500 equity ounces. On January 31, 2003, Newmont sold its 49.9% interest in TVX Newmont Americas to TVX Gold Inc. for $180 million. Newmont obtained a 48.8% interest in Echo Bay through its acquisition of Franco Nevada in February 2002. Franco Nevada purchased capital securities of Echo Bay with face value of $72.4 million in June 2001. In January 2002, $4.6 million of these capital securities were sold. Newmont acquired Franco Nevadas remaining holdings of Echo Bays capital securities in connection with its acquisition of Franco Nevada. Subsequent to this acquisition, an agreement was reached with Echo Bay and the capital securities holders to exchange the capital securities for common stock of Echo Bay. This exchange of capital securities debt obligations for common stock occurred on April 3, 2002 and resulted in Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont) owning 48.8% of Echo Bay. From April 3, 2002, Newmont accounted for its investment in Echo Bay under the equity method. On January 31, 2003, Kinross Gold Corporation, Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and TVX Gold Inc. were combined, and TVX Gold acquired Newmonts 49.9% interest in the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture. Under the terms of the combination and acquisition, Newmont received a 13.8% interest in the restructured Kinross in exchange for its 45.67% interest in Echo Bay and $180 million for its interest in TVX Newmont Americas. Newmont recorded a gain of approximately $90 million on the exchange of Echo Bay. During 2002, Newmonts share of Echo Bay gold sales was 185,200 equity ounces. Royalty Interests Newmonts merchant banking business holds royalty interests, which were acquired as a result of the Franco Nevada acquisition. Royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return (NSR) royalty that provides for the payment either in cash or physical metal (in kind) of a specified percentage of production, less certain specified transportation and refining costs. In some cases, Newmont owns a net profit interest (NPI) entitling Newmont to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case, from a particular mining operation. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in kind at the option of Newmont. Newmont earned $35.7 million of royalty revenue in 2002 and expects to earn approximately $38 million to $42 million in 2003. Financial Results Sales gold were $2.57 billion in 2002, an increase of 54% compared to gold sales of $1.67 billion in 2001, primarily reflecting the incremental impact of the acquired Newmont Australia Limited (formerly Normandy) operations and an increase in the average realized gold price. Gold sales in 2001 declined 8.4% from $1.82 billion in 2000 from lower production and a lower average realized gold price. Variances in sales revenue are illustrated in the following table: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated gold sales (in millions) $ 2,566.9 $ 1,666.1 $ 1,819.0 Consolidated production ozs. sold (in thousands) 8,217.9 6,141.8 6,472.9 Average price received per ounce $ 313 $ 271 $ 282 Average market price per ounce $ 310 $ 271 $ 279 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 Increase (decrease) in consolidated sales due to (in millions): Consolidated production $ 4.8 $ (92.3 ) Average gold price received 246.1 (60.6 ) Acquisition of Normandy 649.9 Total $ 900.8 $ (152.9 ) 58 Table of Contents Sales base metals totaled $55.3 million in 2002 and related primarily to the wholly owned and operated Golden Grove copper/zinc operation in Western Australia ($50.9 million), with a minor portion contributed by the Kasese cobalt operation ($4.4 million) that was sold in 2002. Golden Grove and Kasese were both acquired as part of the acquisition of Normandy. Royalties of $35.7 million were recorded during 2002 and were related primarily to the acquisition of Franco Nevada in February 2002. Royalty revenue pertained primarily to the Goldstrike and Stillwater properties. $11.4 million of royalties pertained to oil and gas interests in 2002. Gain (loss) on sale of marketable securities of Lihir of $47.3 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2002 when Newmont sold its 9.7% holding in Lihir Gold Limited. As a result, Newmont is no longer a shareholder of Lihir. Newmont realized proceeds of $84 million on the sale. A non cash write down of $23.9 million with respect to the Lihir marketable securities was recorded in 2000, resulting from an other than temporary decline in market value based on the length of time and the extent to which such value had been less than cost basis. This write down was reclassified to Sales and other income from Costs and expenses where it was classified in prior years to conform to 2002 presentation. During 2001, the valuation of the marketable securities of Lihir significantly increased, resulting in an $18.3 million gain, which was recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Dividends, interest, foreign currency exchange and other income increased to $39.8 million in 2002 from $7.4 million and $9.7 million in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Interest income totaled $14.1 million in 2002, compared to $3.0 million and $10.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in interest income in 2002 resulted primarily from the increase in the Companys average cash balances, partially offset by lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income in 2001 from 2000 reflected lower interest rates during the year. Foreign currency exchange gains in 2002 totaled $14.0 million, compared to losses of $5.1 million and $6.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gains in 2002 arose primarily from translation gains on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in A$ at the acquired Newmont Australia Limited, partially offset by losses from cross currency swaps and other foreign currency transactions. Other income also includes gains on the sale of exploration properties of $5.9 million, $3.1 million and $1.0 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Costs applicable to sales gold, which includes total cash costs and provisions for estimated final reclamation expenses related to consolidated gold production, increased to $1.54 billion in 2002 from $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in costs in 2002 primarily related to incremental impact of the mining operations acquired from Normandy, as well as an increase in the average total cash costs per ounce in 2002 to $189 per ounce from $184 and $170 per ounce in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total cash costs per ounce increased in 2002 primarily at Nevada and Yanacocha, which together accounted for 51% of equity gold sales in 2002. The increase in total cash costs per ounce in 2001 compared to 2000 is also primarily attributable to Nevada and Yanacocha, which represented 67% of equity gold sales in 2001. Costs applicable to sales base metals primarily related to the wholly owned and operated Golden Grove copper/zinc operation in Western Australia, with a minor portion contributed by the Kasese cobalt operation that was sold in 2002. Deferred stripping costs In general, mining costs are charged to Costs applicable to sales as incurred. However, at open pit mines, which generally have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios over the mine lives, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units of production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste to ore ratios; however industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Companys operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold with an 59 Table of Contents equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there could be greater volatility in the Companys period to period results of operations. Details of deferred stripping with respect to the Companys open pit mines where deferred stripping concept is applied are as follows (unaudited): Nevada(3) Mesquite(4) 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 125.1 138.4 145.1 n/a 237.6 120.7 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.073 0.066 0.066 n/a 0.023 0.018 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 72.2 88.9 106.6 n/a 155.5 180.4 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.081 0.060 0.060 n/a 0.031 0.016 Remaining Mine Life (years) 9 9 10 n/a 1 La Herradura(5) Minahasa(6) 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 141.3 177.0 144.4 n/a 14.5 19.8 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.031 0.035 0.032 n/a 0.172 0.195 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 158.5 200.0 228.4 n/a 15.9 16.4 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.026 0.025 0.024 n/a 0.131 0.205 Remaining Mine Life (years) 6 6 7 n/a 1 2002 Tanami Kalgoorie Martha Ovacik Life of mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 61.9 95.0 28.8 26.3 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.113 0.065 0.093 0.356 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (2) 78.4 101.0 33.2 29.1 Average ore grade (ounces of gold per ton) 0.107 0.052 0.100 0.358 Remaining Mine Life (years) 6 14 4 2 (1) Total tons to be mined in future divided by total ounces of gold to be recovered in future, based on proven and probable reserves. (2) Total tons mined divided by total ounces of gold recovered. (3) The life of mine stripping ratio decreased during 2002 and 2001 from 2000 reflecting the deferral of open pit projects in response to lower gold prices. The actual stripping ratio during 2002 and 2001 decreased from 2000 due to mining higher grade ore zones in the Twin Creeks pit. (4) The life of mine stripping ratio increased in 2001 versus 2000 reflecting significant changes to the mine plan in the final year of operations. The actual stripping ratio was lower during 2001 in comparison to 2000 as a result of mining higher grade material. (5) The life of mine stripping ratios decreased during 2002 from 2001 reflecting an increase in reserve ounces and increased during 2001 from 2000 reflecting an increase in reserves, which resulted in a change in the pit design. The actual stripping ratio decreased in 2002 from 2001 due to waste removal in 2001 in preparation for 2002 mining activities. 60 Table of Contents (6) The actual and life of mine stripping ratios decreased during 2001 from 2000 reflecting higher grade ore zones at the bottom of the Mesel pit as mining concluded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was $505.6 million, $301.6 million and $320.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 is primarily from the incremental impact of the acquired Newmont Australia Limited (formerly Normandy) operating sites and the amortization of mining royalty interests acquired from Franco Nevada as part of the February 2002 acquisitions. The increase also resulted from increased tons mined at Yanacocha in 2002 due to a full year of production at the La Quinua deposit and achieving a more consistent production profile over the prior year. The decrease in 2001 compared to 2000 resulted primarily from decreased gold production at Nevada, partially offset by the impact of 2000 capital expenditures at Yanacocha. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to total $560 million to $590 million in 2003. Variations in Depreciation, depletion and amortization are summarized as follows: Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Depreciation, depletion and amortization: North America: Nevada $ 118.2 $ 117.4 $ 126.4 Mesquite, California 6.3 7.5 9.1 La Herradura, Mexico 3.1 3.2 2.6 Golden Giant, Canada 20.5 18.3 25.8 Holloway, Canada 6.7 6.5 10.6 Total North America 154.8 152.9 174.5 South America: Yanacocha, Peru 121.5 82.3 68.8 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 13.8 19.5 23.9 Total South America 135.3 101.8 92.7 Australia: Pajingo 20.6 4.3 4.3 Kalgoorlie 9.0 Yandal 43.5 Tanami 32.5 Other 6.0 Total Australia 111.6 4.3 4.3 Other Operations: Zarafshan Newmont 10.3 11.9 14.0 Minahasa 9.5 22.8 26.7 Martha, New Zealand 13.9 Ovacik, Turkey 11.5 Total Other Operations 45.2 34.7 40.7 Other: Merchant Banking 22.6 Base Metals Operations 22.9 Exploration 7.8 1.6 0.4 Corporate and Other 5.4 6.3 8.1 Total Other 58.7 7.9 8.5 Total Newmont $ 505.6 $ 301.6 $ 320.7 61 Table of Contents Exploration and research expenses in 2002 were $88.9 million in 2002, an increase of 60% from $55.5 million in 2001. Expenditures in 2001 decreased from $77.4 million in 2000. Exploration activities in 2002 increased as a result of the integration of the Normandy and Franco Nevada exploration programs and from the increase in available capital to fund exploration activities due to higher prevailing gold prices in 2002. The 2002 exploration program added approximately 9.4 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves replacing depletion in 2002. The decrease in 2001 exploration expenditures reflected planned reductions as a result of lower gold prices and an increased focus on exploration activities at or around existing operations. Exploration expenditures are expected to be approximately $95 million to $100 million in 2003. General and administrative was $115.3 million in 2002, an increase of 88% compared to $61.2 million in 2001 and 81% compared to $63.7 million in 2000. The increase in 2002 primarily relates to increased administrative costs resulting from the integration of Normandy and Franco Nevada. General and administrative is expected to be approximately $90 to $95 million in 2003 as the Company begins to realize benefits from the on going synergies of the Normandy and Franco Nevada acquisitions. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $129.6 million, $98.1 million and $106.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $5.2 million, $10.6 million and $5.5 million in each year, respectively. Net interest expense increased in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Normandy of approximately $913.7 million. Net interest expense in 2001 decreased from 2000 because of lower average interest rates and higher capitalized interest for Yanacocha. Interest expense is expected to total approximately $90 million to $95 million in 2003. Expenses for acquisition settlement of $42.2 million in 2000 related to the resolution of a dispute regarding Newmonts purchase of an additional 13.35% interest in Minera Yanacocha as described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Write down of assets totaled $48.1 million, $57.8 million and $75.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, the Company reduced the carrying value of certain assets by $48.1 million pre tax, with the majority of the write down relating to the reduction of inventories to lower of cost or net realizable value. The write downs related to Nevada ($37.0 million), Minahasa ($4.6 million), Newmont Australia ($2.4 million), Wiluna ($1.6 million), Kori Kollo ($1.0 million), the Ity property ($0.8 million) and other operations ($0.7 million). In Nevada, ore stockpile inventory was reduced by $32 million as a result of both net realizable value analysis and a comprehensive physical survey of all stockpiles, while leach pad, mill in process and finished goods inventories were reduced by $2.9 million, $1.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. At the Minahasa mine the leach pad inventory, finished goods inventory and materials and supply inventories were reduced by $0.2 million, $2.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively. At Newmont Australia, $2.4 million in undeveloped mineral interests was written down. Ore stockpile inventory was reduced $1.2 million and mill in process inventory was reduced by $0.4 million at the Wiluna mine. At Kori Kollo, the write down reduced materials and supply inventories by $0.5 million and fixed assets were abandoned with a net historical cost of $0.5 million. Reductions of inventories at other operations totaled $0.7 million. Finally, the Ity mine was sold in the first quarter of 2002, with the future estimated royalty payments recorded as a receivable at fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company determined that future royalty payments were uncertain due to political unrest in the region where the operations are located and a loss of $0.8 million was recorded. In 2001, the Company reduced the carrying value of certain long lived and other assets by $57.8 million pre tax. Total write downs related to Minahasa ($19.8 million), Nevada ($23.2 million), Kori Kollo ($4.9 million), Yanacocha ($4.9 million), the San Luis property in Colorado ($3.5 million) and other operations ($1.5 million). The write down of long lived assets represented the excess carrying value of assets compared to fair value, with fair value determined using discounted future cash flow analysis. Such cash flows are based on estimated recoverable ounces, future production and capital costs, and gold price assumptions. The assumed gold price was $285 per ounce for 2002 and $300 per ounce for all future years. The Minahasa write down reduced fixed assets by $12.1 million, increased reclamation liabilities by $3.7 million and reduced stockpiles, ore on 62 Table of Contents leach pads, and materials and supply inventories by $1.8 million, $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Nevada write down reduced stockpiles, ore on leach pads and in process inventory by $18.3 million, fixed assets by $4.4 million and precious metals by $0.5 million. The Kori Kollo write down reduced fixed assets by $4.8 million and in process inventory by $0.1 million. The San Luis write down reduced fixed assets by $2.0 million and materials and supply inventories by $1.5 million. At Yanacocha heap leach inventory was reduced $4.1 million and other assets were reduced $0.8 million, and total inventory reductions of $1.5 million were recorded at other operations. In 2000, total write downs of $75.9 were recorded on long lived and other assets. The reductions related to the Holloway mine in Canada ($30.8 million), the short lived Mesquite mine in California ($14.8 million), Nevada ($13.6 million), the Kori Kollo mine in Bolivia ($5.7 million), the acquisition cost of the Mezcala property in Mexico ($6.5 million), the Minahasa mine in Indonesia ($3.8 million) and the Battle Mountain Complex in Nevada ($0.7 million). The Holloway write down reduced fixed assets by $30.8 million. Mesquites write down reduced leach pad inventory by $9.7 million, deferred stripping by $1.4 million and fixed assets by $3.7 million. Stockpile and mill in process inventories were reduced $9.7 million and $3.9 million at Nevada, respectively. The Kori Kollo write down reduced inventory by $5.0 million and fixed assets by $0.7 million. In process and ore on leach pads inventories at Minahasa were reduced by $3.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The Company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined using estimated future cash flow analysis. An impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces, gold prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed engineering life of mine plans. The term recoverable ounces refers to the estimated amount of gold that will be obtained from proven and probable reserves after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. Generally, all assets at a particular operation are used together to generate cash flow. Assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions and or the Companys performance could have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, that established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement was adopted on January 1, 2002, and there was no impact to the Company upon adoption. The Company records inventories at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and inventory carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. Net realizable value is calculated as the estimated future sales price of the product based on prevailing and long term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write downs of inventories include prevailing short term and long term metals prices and prevailing costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as actually realized ore grades and production throughput. Merger and restructuring expenses of $60.5 million in 2001 included $28.1 million of transaction and related costs associated with the Battle Mountain merger and $32.4 million of restructuring expenses that included $22.1 million for voluntary early retirement pension benefits and $10.3 million for employee severance and office closures. 63 Table of Contents Other expenses in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $29.5 million, $11.5 million and $34.6 million, respectively. Included in 2002 are approximately $7.3 million of integration costs relating to the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada, $16.8 million of severance and other benefits, and $3.1 million for officers life insurance. Also included in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $5.2 million, $1.0 million and $12.3 million, respectively, for increases to environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Environmental expenses in 2002 primarily relate to legal costs incurred with respect to the Pinal Creek site (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The year 2000 also included $13.2 million to increase the remediation liability for San Luis, Colorado and $10.0 million for costs associated with a mercury spill at Yanacocha, both described in the Environmental section of this discussion and analysis. (Loss) gain on derivative instruments totaled $(39.8) million in 2002, compared to $1.8 million and $26.8 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and relates to non cash mark to market gains and losses recognized on gold derivative instruments. The loss in 2002 primarily relates to the acquired Normandy gold hedge books and resulted from the increase in the US$ gold price from $300 per ounce at February 15, 2002, the date of acquisition of Normandy, to $347 at December 31, 2002, partially offset by the appreciation in the A$ from $0.5175 at February 15, 2002 to $0.5645 at December 31, 2002. The majority of the acquired Normandy gold hedge books consist of contracts to receive Australian dollars and to deliver gold. Generally, higher gold prices increase Newmonts derivative liability position, whereas appreciation in the Australian dollar decreases Newmonts derivative liability position. Prior to the acquisition of Normandy, (Loss) gain on derivative instruments primarily reflected the change in fair value of written call option contracts at the end of each year. In September 2001, Newmont entered into transactions that closed out these call options. These options were replaced with a series of sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. The call options were marked to the market value of $53.8 million immediately prior to their close, resulting in a non cash gain of $1.8 million in 2001. The value of the new sales contracts was recorded as Deferred revenue from sale of future production and will be included in sales revenue as delivery occurs. In 2000, the non cash mark to market gain on the written call options was $26.8 million. Income tax (expense) benefit was $(19.9) million in 2002, compared to $59.3 million and $(5.6) million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys effective tax rates were (9.2)%, 94.0%, and (14.3)% based on Pre tax income (loss) before minority interest, equity income (loss) of affiliates and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $216.3 million, $(63.1) million and $38.9 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The factors that most significantly impact the Companys effective tax rate are percentage depletion and resource allowances, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, foreign currency translation gains and losses and special non recurring items. Most of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that exceed the Companys tax basis in its mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by US subsidiaries included in the Companys consolidated US income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold or other minerals produced by the Company. In general, such deductions are calculated separately for each operating mine and are based on a complex two part formula that considers the net of royalty revenue received from sales of the mine output and the taxable income from the particular mine that produced the output. Similar types of deductions are provided for mining operations in Canada and are referred to as resource allowances. The tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $34.4 million, $17.3 million and $17.5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The increase in 2002 compared to the other periods resulted primarily from the rise in the Companys average realized gold price to $313 compared to $271 and $282 for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company also operates in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives, and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences contribute to move the Companys overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the US statutory rate and the effect of these differences are shown in the Income Tax footnote as either a rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings net 64 Table of Contents of credits allowable in the United States for taxes paid to non US taxing jurisdictions that arise when the related foreign earnings become taxable in the United States. Coupled with differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations, the Companys ability to fully utilize all of its available foreign income tax credits on a year by year basis also is highly dependent on the price of the minerals produced by the Company since lower prices could result in the Company having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have very limited carryback and carryforward periods and can only be used to reduce the US income tax imposed on the Companys foreign earnings included in its annual US consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, were reductions of income tax expense of $16.7 million, $29.5 million and $29.5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in the reduction in 2002 was primarily attributable to (i) significant pre tax losses in certain non US taxing jurisdictions such as Australia where the tax rates are lower than the US statutory rate; (ii) tax incentives from the reinvestment of earnings in Peru being lower in 2002; and (iii) an increase in the Companys earnings from its Canadian operations from higher gold prices and acquisitions given that Canadian income tax rates are higher than the US statutory tax rate; partially offset by (iv) the lower rate on Canadian capital gains realized from the Companys sale of the marketable securities of Lihir. The need to record valuation allowances related to the Companys deferred tax assets (primarily attributable net operating losses and tax credits) is primarily dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) the Companys long term estimate of future average realized minerals prices and; (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements imposed upon the Company and its subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and credit carryforwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carryforward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities accrued for financial reporting purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Increases to income tax expense or reductions of income tax benefits were $2.5 million, $17.3 million and $51.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, the Company reversed part of a valuation allowance reflecting the actual utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforward of a subsidiary acquired in a prior pooling of interests business combination, offset by valuation allowances recorded for losses in the acquired Newmont Australia Limited (NAL) group of companies. The major factor in the decline in 2002, however, resulted from the Companys ability to utilize substantially all of its currently arising foreign tax credits due to rising taxable income from higher gold prices. In 2001, however, it experienced a limitation on the use of such credits due to lower taxable income in the United States primarily caused by lower gold prices. In 2000, valuation allowances were higher compared to 2001, resulting from not having available prior period net operating losses. The higher valuation allowances also resulted from lower utilization of foreign tax credits due to higher foreign earnings remittances and earnings in Peru causing more foreign taxes to be available as credits, as well as a lack of sufficient taxable income in the United States to utilize such credits, again caused by low gold prices. The Company consolidates subsidiaries with interests attributable to minority interests, but for tax purposes, the Company is responsible for the income taxes only on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to its ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such minority interest contributed to the overall reduction in the Companys effective income tax rate by $11.5 million, $10.1 million and $19.4 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The reduction in 2002 increased from 2001 due to a higher gold price that was partially offset by fewer reinvestment credits at Yanacocha under Peruvian tax regulations. The reduction in 2000 was greater than in 2001 from higher earnings from the Yanacocha project in Peru due to a combination of higher gold prices and reinvestment credits. The Companys effective tax rate in 2002 was increased by $9.3 million of foreign currency translation losses primarily related to monetary assets and liabilities and the gold derivatives positions in Newmont Australia 65 Table of Contents Limited whose functional currency is the US dollar. Because Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from NAL, such translation losses are not subject to deferred tax. During 2002, the Company settled an audit conducted by the Internal Revenue Service of the tax returns of an acquired entity involving several taxable periods that predated the Companys acquisition. At issue was the proper federal income tax treatment of a portion of a transaction involving an exchange of natural resource properties. The settlement gave rise to additional future tax deductions the tax benefit of which had previously not been recorded and for which no deferred taxes were required to be provided. Accordingly, the Companys effective tax rate for 2002 has been reduced by approximately $10 million due to this non recurring item. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing the Companys effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, Newmonts effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. Equity income (loss) of affiliates totaled $51.4 million, $22.5 million and $(17.7) million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002, the Company recorded equity income (loss) from Batu Hijau, the copper and gold project in Indonesia in which Newmont has a 56.25% effective interest, of $42.1 million, compared to $22.5 million and $(17.7) million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Batu Hijau represented all of Newmonts equity income (loss) in 2001 and 2000, whereas in 2002, the Company also recorded $9.7 million for TVX Newmont Americas, $(0.4) million for Echo Bay, $(1.8) million for Australian Magnesium Corporation and $1.7 million for AGR Matthey Joint Venture. The new equity investments in 2002 were acquired as part of the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada. Equity income of Batu Hijau improved in 2002 primarily from lower net cash costs in 2002, primarily from higher gold by product credits due to higher prevailing gold prices and production throughput capacity improvements, partially offset by lower grade ore. The improvements included operational initiatives and the addition of a pebble crushing circuit. Lower costs in 2002 at Batu Hijau were partially offset by a lower average realized copper price for the year as compared to 2001. The equity income of Batu Hijau in 2001 improved dramatically from 2000 due to the full impact of the ramp up in production that commenced in the fourth quarter of 1999. TVX Newmont Americas was 49.9% owned by Newmont and 50.1% owned by TVX Gold Inc. during 2002. The principal assets of TVX Newmont Americas are interests in operating gold mines in South America (Paracatu, Crixas and La Coipa) and Canada (Musselwhite and New Britannia). On January 31, 2003, Newmont sold its 49.9% interest in TVX Newmont Americas to TVX Gold Inc. for $180 million. Newmont held a weighted average ownership of 45.7% in Echo Bay Mines Limited in 2002 from April 3, 2002 to December 31, 2002. On January 31, 2003, Kinross Gold Corporation, TVX Gold Inc. and Echo Bay combined, and Newmont exchanged its investment in Echo Bay for approximately 13.8% of the new Kinross. Newmonts investment in Kinross will be accounted for as a marketable security in 2003. Newmont recorded a gain of approximately $90 million on the sale of Echo Bay in the first quarter of 2003. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in 2002 included a $(28.7) million loss for a minimum pension liability adjustment, $(16.7) million for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and $(12.8) million for a decline in value of marketable equity securities, partially offset by a $3.6 million gain from foreign currency translation adjustments related to the Companys subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company was required to record a minimum liability in 2002. As a result of such adjustment, an intangible asset was recorded and, to the extent the minimum liability adjustment exceeded the unrecognized net transition liability, Stockholders equity was reduced. The unrealized losses on derivatives in 2002 related primarily to the effective portion of the change in fair value of gold instruments assumed as part of the Normandy acquisition that were designated as cash flow hedges. The losses resulted primarily from rising gold prices during the year, partially offset by a strengthening Australian dollar. The impact of the marketable equity securities in 2002 primarily included $(18.3) million related to the sale of Lihir, partially offset by the Companys share of unrealized gains on marketable securities held in Echo Bay. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in 2001 included an $18.3 million gain for temporary changes in the market value of Lihir Gold securities, $3.2 million for losses associated with foreign currency translation adjustments and $0.9 million for 66 Table of Contents the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. For 2000, other comprehensive loss, net of tax, included a loss of $1.8 million for foreign currency translation adjustments and a $1.3 million minimum pension liability adjustment. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS Nos. 141 and 142, Business Combinations and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, respectively. The adoption of these standards on January 1, 2002, as required, did not impact Newmonts historical Consolidated Financial Statements or results of operations as of that date. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada were accounted for as purchases under SFAS 141 and a significant portion of the $4.3 billion purchase price represents goodwill, resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Such goodwill will not be amortized, but will be subject to impairment testing at least annually, as required by SFAS 142. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company reclassified $177.0 million of acquired mineral rights and leases from Property, plant and mine development, net to Mineral interests and other intangible assets, net. Acquired proven and probable reserves are amortized using the units of production basis over the respective mine lives. Undeveloped mineral interests are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, taking into account residual values. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established a methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement was adopted as required on January 1, 2003, when Newmont recorded the estimated fair value of reclamation liabilities (asset retirement obligations or ARO) and increased the carrying amount of the related assets (asset retirement cost or ARC) to be retired in the future. The ARC will be depreciated over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from revisions to either the timing or amount of the original ARO fair value estimate. Newmont expects to record increases of approximately $60 to $75 million in the ARC, net increases of approximately $110 million to $135 million to the ARO, increases of approximately $1 million to $3 million to accrued liabilities for worker participation bonuses in Peru, increases to deferred tax assets of approximately $10 million to $14 million, a reduction to Newmonts investment in Batu Hijau of approximately $3 million to $9 million and a reduction in minority interest in subsidiaries of approximately $14 million to $18 million, at January 1, 2003, with a cumulative effect of adoption of approximately $30 million to $40 million to be recorded in results of operations in the first quarter of 2003. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which established a single accounting model, based on the framework of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The statement was adopted January 1, 2002, and there was no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption. In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4 , 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. The statement nullified SFAS 4, SFAS 44 and SFAS 64 and established that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The Statement also amends SFAS Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions and to make technical corrections to various other FASB statements. For the provisions of the statement relating to the extinguishment of debt, SFAS 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions relating to SFAS 13 are effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002, and all other provisions are effective for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002. There was no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 67 Table of Contents In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addressed financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. It nullified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan as was required under EITF No. 94 3. SFAS 146 also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, and we do not anticipate any impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption except with respect to those exit or disposal activities that are initiated by the Company after that date. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, to provide alternative methods for voluntary transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. SFAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. SFAS 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB Statements 5, 57, 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 requires recognition and measurement of guarantees entered into or modified beginning on January 1, 2003 and requires expanded disclosure of guarantees as of December 31, 2002. The Company has conformed its disclosures with respect to guarantees to the requirements of FIN 45. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which provides guidance on the identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46 impacts accounting for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and requires expanded disclosure of variable interest entities for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The Company has determined that there will be no impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption. Liquidity and Capital Resources For 2002, Net cash provided by operating activities was $670.3 million, compared to $369.7 million and $534.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Increased operating cash flows in 2002 primarily reflect the impact of operating cash flows from the Normandy and Franco Nevada operations from February 15, 2002 and the impact of an increased average realized gold price in 2002 of $313 per ounce. Operating cash flows in 2001 declined from 2000 due to a lower average realized gold price of $271 per ounce in 2001 compared to $282 per ounce in 2000. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $112.1 million, $(385.0) million and $(510.5) million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Additions to property, plant and mine development were $(300.1) million, $(390.0) and $(387.4) million. See Capital Expenditures below for more information on capital expenditures in each year. Cash from investing activities in 2002 also included $404.4 million of proceeds from the sales of short term investments obtained as part of the acquisition of Franco Nevada, $84 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of Lihir and $50.8 million of proceeds from the settlement of cross currency swaps that were obtained as part of the Normandy acquisition, offset by $90.3 million of net cash outflows for the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco Nevada ($461.7 million cash consideration for Normandy shares, less cash acquired from acquisitions, net of acquisition costs, of $371.4 million), $24.8 million of cash advances to affiliated companies and $21.1 million of cash outflows to settle ineffective derivative instruments. There were 68 Table of Contents no significant investing cash flows other than capital expenditures in 2001, but in 2000, there were $78.8 million of advances to affiliated companies and $54.7 million of costs associated with the merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(530.1) million in 2002, compared to $85.1 million and $(65.4) million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Financing activities in 2002 included drawings on the Companys credit facilities of $493.4 million to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of Normandy. Such drawings were paid down shortly after the acquisition with the proceeds from the sale of the Franco Nevada short term investments. Including paying down the credit facilities, the Company repaid approximately $1.0 billion of debt. See Financing Activities below. Dividend payments for 2002 totaled $50.0 million, and the Company received approximately $67.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from the exercise of employee stock options. In 2001, Newmont received proceeds from long term debt of $1.0 billion and repaid $941.6 million, paid $31.0 million of dividends and benefited from the lifting of restrictions on $40.0 million of cash. Newmont made payments of debt, net of new proceeds, of $46.6 million and paid dividends of $27.6 million in 2000. Newmonts contractual obligations at December 31, 2002 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years (in millions) Long term debt $ 1,499.3 $ 78.6 $ 624.5 $ 117.5 $ 678.7 Capital lease obligations 317.3 36.7 61.5 72.1 147.0 Operating leases 25.9 3.8 6.8 5.9 9.4 Total $ 1,842.5 $ 119.1 $ 692.8 $ 195.5 $ 835.1 For information on the Companys long term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Notes 11 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Newmont believes it will be able to fund all existing obligations from Net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes it will be able to raise capital as needed in capital markets in the future as opportunities for expansion arise. 69 Table of Contents Investing Activities Additions to Property, plant and mine development Capital expenditures for property, plant and mine development decreased in 2002 from 2001 primarily from the completion of the development of the La Quinua project at Yanacocha in late 2001. Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 remained approximately the same.

Yanacocha capital expenditures included leach pad expansions ($69.2 million), mine development ($16.7 million), environmental expenditures ($14.3 million), carbon columns and refinery ($12.9 million) and other replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Zarafshan Newmont included $3.4 million for the completion of the heap leach pad expansion and associated conveyor support. Capital expenditures at Yandal included deferred mine development ($14.3 million). Capital expenditures at Pajingo included mine development ($5.6 million) and replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Kalgoorlie included haul truck purchases ($3.6 million) and replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Golden Grove included mine development of $6.1 million and replacement capital. 70 Table of Contents In 2001, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($15.7 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), mine facilities at Deep Post ($9.9 million), mining equipment ($6.3 million), development of the Phoenix project ($4.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($128.4 million), Yanacocha leach pad operations ($44.9 million), mining equipment ($44.3 million), Carachugo leach pad operations ($19.3 million) and other replacement capital. Capital expenditures at Zarafshan Newmont included $19 million for heap leach pad expansion and associated conveyor support facility. In 2000, capital expenditures in Nevada included deferred mine development ($27.5 million, primarily for the Deep Post underground mine), development of the Phoenix project ($9.8 million), mining equipment ($10.1 million) and other replacement capital. Yanacocha capital expenditures included the La Quinua mine ($144.2 million), unitization of regional properties ($45.7 million), leach pad expansion ($30.8 million), mine development ($30.0 million) and other replacement capital. Newmont expects to spend approximately $560 million to $590 million on capital projects in 2003, with approximately $123 million in North America, $95 million in Australia, $260 million in South America and approximately $97 million in other locations. The majority of budgeted expenditures are for mine development and replacement capital. In Nevada, two expansion projects, the Gold Quarry South Layback (GQSL) and the Leeville Underground Mine (Leeville), are under way. GQSL is located in South Area at Carlin and is expected to yield approximately 2.7 million ounces of production, with annual production of between 320,000 and 770,000 ounces commencing in 2004. Total capital expenditures for GQSL are projected to be approximately $37 million, of which $6.7 million had been spent as of December 31, 2002. Leeville is located in Carlins North Area and will produce approximately 3.0 million ounces, with annual production of approximately 500,000 commencing at the end of 2005. Total capital expenditures for Leeville are projected to be $185 million, of which $15.1 million had been spent as of December 31, 2002. Other Investing Activities TVX Newmont Americas and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. On January 31, 2003, Kinross Gold Corporation, Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and TVX Gold Inc. were combined, and TVX Gold acquired Newmonts 49.9% interest in the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture. Under the terms of the combination and acquisition, Newmont received a 13.8% interest in the restructured Kinross in exchange for its 45.67% interest in Echo Bay and $180 million for its interest in TVX Newmont Americas. Newmont recorded a pre tax gain on the exchange of its shares in Echo Bay of approximately $90 million. Batu Hijau As discussed above and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Newmont has an indirect 45% interest in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and its partner, an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation, has an indirect 35% interest. Because Newmont and Sumitomo carried the interest of the 20% Indonesian partner, Newmont recognizes 56.25% of Batu Hijaus income until recouping the bulk of its investment. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Newmonts investment in Batu Hijau was $610.1 million and $543.3 million, respectively. On May 9, 2002, P.T.Newmont Nusa Tenggara (PTNNT) completed a restructuring of its $1.0 billion project financing facility (Senior Debt) that provides PTNNT the ability to defer up to $173.4 million in principal payments scheduled for 2002 and 2003. The restructuring provides a better match between the expected cash flows of the project and the maturities of the debt. Any deferred principal amounts will be repaid between 2004 and 2010. Under this restructuring, Batu Hijau is not permitted to pay dividends or make other restricted payments to Newmont or its partner as long as any amount of deferred principal is outstanding; however, there is no restriction on prepaying any of the deferred principal amounts. Amounts outstanding under the project financing total $913.3 million at December 31, 2002. The amount of deferred principal at December 31, 2002 71 Table of Contents was $86.5 million. Newmont and its partner provide a contingent support line of credit to PTNNT. During 2002, Newmont funded $24.8 million under this contingent support facility as its pro rata share of capital expenditures. Additional support from Newmont and its partner available under this facility amounts to $115.0 million, of which Newmonts pro rata share is $64.7 million. Australian Magnesium Corporation As of December 31, 2002, Newmont had a 22.8% voting interest in Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC). Since then, AMC has raised additional equity to support the development of the Stanwell Magnesium Project, a proprietary chemical and dehydration process for producing anhydrous magnesium chloride as feed for an electrolytic cell to produce molten magnesium metal and magnesium alloys. Northerly Equities Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Australia Limited (NAL), contributed A$100 million (approximately $56 million) in equity to AMC on January 3, 2003, increasing our ownership percentage to 40.9%. However, due to additional equity contributions by third party shareholders, our voting interest decreased to 27.8% on January 31, 2003. NAL and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nottacar Investments Pty Ltd, had also provided to AMC a A$90 million (approximately $51 million) contingent equity commitment in the event the project does not achieve certain specified production and operating criteria by December 2006. Subsequent to year end, however, this contingent equity commitment was renegotiated to require instead that NAL and Nottacar Investments provide AMC with an A$75 million (approximately $42 million) contingent convertible debt and equity facility. NAL has also guaranteed a $30 million obligation payable by AMC to Ford Motor Company in the event the project does not meet certain specified production and operating criteria by November 2005. AMC has indemnified NAL for this obligation, but the indemnity is unsecured. NAL and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries are also guarantors of an $A71 million (approximately $40 million) amortizing loan facility of AMCs subsidiary, QMC Finance Pty Ltd. (QMC), of which A$69.8 million (approximately $39 million) was outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The QMC loan facility expires in November 2006. QMC also is a party to a series of foreign exchange hedging contracts. All obligations related to these contracts have been guaranteed by NAL and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The contracts include a series of foreign exchange forward contracts and bought put options, the last of which expire in June 2006. As of December 31, 2002, the fair value of these contracts was a negative A$12.7 million (approximately $7 million). The Ford guarantee and the guarantees under the QMC loan and hedging facilities arose in connection with NALs support of the project as an investor in AMC and its predecessor entities. The guarantees under the QMC loan facility and hedging contracts could be called in the event of a default by QMC. NALs liability under the QMC loan facility guarantee is limited to the total amount of outstanding borrowings under the facility at the time the guarantee is called. NALs maximum potential liability under its guarantee of the QMC hedging contracts, however, would depend on the market value of the hedging contracts at the time the guarantee is exercised. The principal lender and counterparty under the QMC loan and hedging facilities also has a fixed and floating charge over certain assets of AMC. In the event the guarantees are called, NAL would have a right of subrogation to the lender under Australian law. Takeover Bid for Otter Gold Mines Limited. On December 4, 2002, Newmont NFM announced its intentions to make an offer for all shares and options in Otter Gold Mines Limited (Otter Mines) that Newmont NFM did not already own. Newmont NFM is an Australian corporation that is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Otter Mines is a New Zealand corporation that is also listed on the ASX. As of the date of making the announcement, the Company, through subsidiaries, held an 85.86% interest in Newmont NFM and Newmont NFM, in turn, held 89.17% of the 72 Table of Contents outstanding Otter Mines shares. Newmont NFMs offer was made on January 9, 2003 and closed on February 25, 2003. By the close of the offer, Newmont NFM had acquired in excess of 90% of the total outstanding shares in Otter Mines, which, under New Zealand law, entitled Newmont NFM to compulsorily acquire all remaining outstanding Otter Mines shares. Newmont NFM has initiated the compulsory acquisition process and anticipates that through this process it will own 100% of Otter Mines by the end of April 2003. Newmont NFM Limited Arrangement NAL owns 85.86% of Newmont NFM. On November 28, 2002, Newmont Australia and Newmont NFM announced a proposal that, if approved by Newmont NFM shareholders and the Federal Court of Australia (the Court), would result in Newmont NFM becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of NAL. Under the proposal, Newmont NFM shareholders would have the opportunity to either participate in a share buy back in which Newmont NFM would pay A$16.50 for each Newmont NFM share or receive 4.40 ASX listed Newmont Mining Corporation CHESS Depository Instruments (Newmont CDIs) per Newmont NFM Share. Newmont CDIs are the equivalent of one tenth ( 1/10th) of a share of Newmont common stock. On February 21, 2003, the Court approved the information booklet that was proposed to be sent to Newmont NFM shareholders, and the Court also convened shareholders meetings for April 2, 2003. The information booklet was sent to Newmont NFM shareholders in early March. If the requisite majority of Newmont NFM shareholders vote in favor of the arrangement at the April 2, 2003 scheme meetings, Newmont NFM will apply to the Court for approval of the arrangement. The Court hearing is scheduled for April 11, 2003. If approved by the Court, the arrangement would become effective on the following day and processing of shareholder elections in respect of the buy back and the Newmont CDIs would be completed during April 2003. Pension Funding Due to poor returns on plan assets during the last few years, Newmont expects to fund approximately $20 million into its pension plans in 2003 from Net cash provided by operating activities. Financing Activities Scheduled minimum long term debt repayments are $115.3 million in 2003, $194.2 million in 2004, $491.8 million in 2005, $101.2 million in 2006, $88.4 million in 2007 and $825.7 million thereafter. Newmont expects to be able to fund maturities of its debt from operating cash flow. The Companys $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into June 1997, was replaced in October 2001 with two unsecured multi currency revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 million facility with an initial term of 364 days, which may be extended annually to October 2006; and a $400 million revolving facility, which matures in October 2006. In February 2002, in connection with the Normandy transaction, Newmont acquired an additional A$490 million committed revolving multi option facility with a syndicate of banks. In May 2002, Newmont repaid the $170.6 million outstanding under this facility, closed it and added an additional $150 million Australian bank tranche to the existing facilities for a total borrowing capacity of $750 million. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the Companys credit rating. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 0.70% to 0.975% or the greater of the federal funds rate or the lead banks prime rate. Annual fees vary from 0.10% to 0.40%. At December 31, 2002, the fees were 0.15%, 0.175% and 0.30% of the commitment, for the $200 million, the $400 million and the $150 million facilities, respectively. The facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified limitations on debt to capitalization and debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, 73 Table of Contents and restrictions on incurring liens and transactions with affiliates. There were no borrowings under the facilities as of December 31, 2002. The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. In July 1999, the Company entered into a prepaid forward gold sales contract (the Prepaid Forward) and a forward gold purchase contract (the Forward Purchase). Under the Prepaid Forward, the Company agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces (the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company also agreed under the Prepaid Forward to deliver semi annually 17,951 ounces of gold, beginning June 2000 through June 2007 (the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements) for a total gold delivery obligation over the life of the Prepaid Forward of 752,598 ounces. At the time the Prepaid Forward was entered into, the Company received net proceeds of $137.2 million ($145.0 million of gross proceeds before transaction costs of $653,000 and the purchase of a $7.1 million surety bond to guarantee delivery of the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company may also be entitled to receive additional proceeds in the future in connection with the annual deliveries of 161,111 ounces, to be determined at each delivery date based on the excess, if any, of the then market price for gold (up to a maximum of $380 per ounce) over $300 per ounce. At the time the Company entered into the Prepaid Forward, it also entered into the Forward Purchase, with the same counterparty, to hedge the price risk with respect to the Semi Annual Delivery Requirements. The Forward Purchase provides for semi annual purchases of 17,951 ounces of gold on each semi annual delivery date under the Prepaid Forward at prices increasing from $263 per ounce in 2000 to $354 per ounce in 2007. On each semi annual delivery date, the ounces purchased under the Forward Purchase are delivered in satisfaction of the Companys delivery requirements under the Prepaid Forward. The transaction has been accounted for as a single borrowing of $145 million, with interest accruing, based on an effective interest rate recognized over the full term of the borrowing. Unsecured notes with a principal amount of $150 million due April 1, 2002, bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625% were outstanding at December 31, 2001. Interest was payable semi annually in April and October and the notes were not redeemable prior to maturity. The notes were repaid in April 2002. In May 2001, Newmont issued unsecured notes with a principal amount of $275 million due May 2011 bearing an annual interest rate of 8.625%. Proceeds of $272 million, after transaction costs, were used to repay debt outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility, with the remainder for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in May and November and the notes are redeemable prior to maturity under certain conditions. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Newmont now consolidates two additional unsecured series of notes from Newmont Australia. In July 1998, Normandy Finance Limited (NFL) issued $150.0 million of ten year 7 5/8% guaranteed notes. Interest on the notes is paid semi annually in arrears in January and July and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Also, in July 1998, NFL issued $100.0 million of seven year 7 1/2% guaranteed notes. Interest on the notes is paid semi annually in arrears in January and July and the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The costs related to the issuance of the notes were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes. Both the 7 5/8% notes and the 7 1/2% notes are guaranteed by NAL and certain of its subsidiaries. In April 1998, Normandy Yandal Operations Limited (NYOL), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont, issued $300 million of ten year 8 7/8% senior unsecured notes. In conjunction with the Normandy acquisition, NYOL was acquired by Newmont in February 2002. In March 2002, Newmont, through an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, made an offer to repurchase any and all of NYOLs outstanding 8 7/8% Senior Notes due 2008. As of the offer date, $300 million principal amount of notes was outstanding. The repurchase offer was made pursuant to the terms of an Indenture dated as of April 7, 1998, between NYOL and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Indenture requires that Newmont Yandal, following a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture, make an offer to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. Although the applicable provisions of the 74 Table of Contents Indenture can be read to the contrary, Newmont took the position that a Change of Control occurred on February 20, 2002 when Newmont acquired control of Normandy. The Indenture provides that NYOL is not required to make the Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the offer. Newmonts offer, however, should not be construed as a commitment by Newmont to provide ongoing financial or credit support to NYOL. The Change of Control Offer was open until May 14, 2002, resulted in redemption of $62.8 million of the outstanding notes and gave rise to a $0.6 million loss on extinguishment recorded in Other expenses. At December 31, 2002, $237.2 million was outstanding in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The NYOL notes are non recourse to Newmont and have not been assumed or otherwise guaranteed by Newmont. Interest on the notes is paid semi annually in arrears in April and October. Certain financial instruments were entered into whereby NYOL has agreed to exchange US dollar fixed interest amounts payable with a gold interest rate. Of the total, US$183.6 million has been swapped into a gold interest rate, of which half is fixed at 3.87% and half is floating. The floating rate at December 31, 2002 was 0.865%. Because these notes are specialized, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the debt. See Note 11 for additional information. All NYOL debt is non recourse to Newmont. In April 2002, Newmont announced the redemption of all issued and outstanding shares of its $3.25 convertible preferred stock as of May 15, 2002. The Company paid a redemption price of $50.325 per share, plus $0.8125 per share for all accrued dividends at the redemption date. In settlement of the total redemption price of $51.1375 per share, Newmont issued to holders of record 1.9187 shares of its common stock. This redemption eliminated $7.5 million of annual preferred stock dividends prospectively. On April 26, 2002, Newmont filed post effective amendments to previous Registration Statements on Form S 3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the purpose of increasing its existing universal shelf registration from $500 million to $1.0 billion. This filing will provide the capability to access capital markets for debt or equity securities as required and as market conditions warrant. The Form S 3 has not yet been declared effective. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased $23.0 million, $52.3 million, $10.0 million and $30.9 million face amount of its outstanding 8 3/8%, 8 5/8%, NAL 7 1/2% and NAL 7 5/8% debentures, respectively, for total cash considerations of $135.8 million. Newmont recorded a pre tax charge of $19.6 million related to these repurchases during the first quarter of 2003. Environmental The Companys mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $268.2 million and $130.0 million, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 143, Asset Retirements Obligations (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements on page 67). In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk 75 Table of Contents profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Companys best estimate of its liability for these matters, $48.1 million and $55.7 million were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts are included in Other accrued liabilities and Reclamation and remediation liabilities. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 45% greater or 25% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2002. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Costs and expenses, Other in the period estimates are revised. For more information on the Companys reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in 2002 and 2001 capital expenditures was approximately $14.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Expenditures of $47.5 million are anticipated in 2003, primarily at Yanacocha. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of cash operating costs. Newmont spent $14.6 million, $8.1 million and $18.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former mining sites discussed in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and expects to spend approximately $14.4 million in 2003. 2002 expenditures relate primarily to the Dawn and Resurrection sites. In 2000, the remediation liability associated with the San Luis property in Colorado was increased $13.2 million. In June 2000, a transport contractor of Minera Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles southwest of the mine. Elemental mercury is a by product of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instruments and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Minera Yanacocha in response to the incident. In August 2000, Minera Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 soles (approximately $500,000) to the Peruvian government. Minera Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. In addition, it has entered into agreements with three of the communities impacted by this incident to provide a variety of public works as compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident. Costs of $13 million for public works, remediation efforts, personal compensation and the fine have been incurred for the Yanacocha spill to date. Neither the Company nor Minera Yanacocha can reasonably predict the likelihood of any additional expenditures related to this matter. Forward Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward Looking Statements in Item 1, Business, commencing on page 9. 76 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Metal Price Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; and global mine production levels. Based on estimates of Newmonts stand alone 2003 production and expenses, a $20 per ounce change in the gold price would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $107.5 million in cash flow from operations and approximately $87.5 million (about $0.21 per share) in net income. Changes in the market price of copper also affect Newmonts profitability and cash flow from its investment in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and its Golden Grove mine in Australia. Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. Based on estimates of Newmont stand alone 2003 production and expenses, a $0.10 per pound change in the copper price would result in an increase or decrease in net income of approximately $27.0 million (about $0.06 per share). Hedging Newmont generally sells its production at spot market prices. Newmont has historically, on a limited basis, entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold production and to manage risks associated with sales contracts, commodities, interest rates and foreign currency. In addition, at the time of Normandys acquisition, three of its affiliates had a substantial derivative instrument position. These three affiliates are now known as Newmont Gold Treasury Pty Ltd, the Newmont NFM, and Newmont Yandal Operations (NYOL). Following the Normandy acquisition, however, and in accordance with the Companys non gold hedging philosophy, efforts to proactively reduce and simplify the Normandy hedge positions have been undertaken. Accordingly, the Normandy gold hedge books have been reduced by approximately 3.3 million ounces since February 2002. Gold forward sales contracts and other instruments (committed hedging obligations) were reduced by 2,156,000 ounces since February 15, 2002 by delivering production into the contracts. Similarly, uncommitted contracts for 855,000 ounces were either delivered into or lapsed. In addition, 288,000 ounces of an overlaid position were closed out, leaving an open sold convertible put position of 240,000 ounces and an open bought call option position of 48,000 ounces. Combining the 2,156,000 committed ounces delivered, the 855,000 uncommitted ounces eliminated and the 288,000 ounces of overlaid positions closed out through December 31, 2002, the Normandy gold hedge books were reduced to 5.2 million committed ounces and 1.5 million uncommitted ounces for a total of 6.6 million ounces. The mark to market valuation of the Normandy gold hedge books at December 31, 2002, however, grew to a negative $433 million broken down as follows: Newmont Gold Treasury Pty Ltd: $(122) million; Newmont NFM: $(23) million; and, Newmont Yandal Operations Limited: $(288) million. The following table shows the approximate sensitivities of the US$ mark to market value of the Normandy gold hedge books to certain market variables as of December 31, 2002 (actual changes in the timing and amount of the following variables may differ from the assumed changes below): Market Variables Change in Variable Change in Mark to Market Value (millions) A$ Interest Rates +/ 1.0% /+$40.0 US$/A$ Exchange Rates +/ US$0.01 +/ $35.4 Gold Lease Rates +/ 1.0% +/ $15.2 US$ Interest Rates +/ 1.0% /+$10.5 US$ Gold Price/oz. +/ $1.00 /+$6.6 77 Table of Contents Newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. Credit risk is minimized by dealing only with major financial institutions/counterparties. A number of NYOLs hedge positions, however, are governed by agreements that confer on the relevant counterparties a right to terminate the position prior to its agreed scheduled maturity date. Such a termination would result in an immediate cash settlement of that contract based on the market value on the date of termination and could result in a cash settlement obligation to NYOL hedge counterparties in excess of available funds. NYOL obligations, however, are non recourse to Newmont and its other subsidiaries. The table below summarizes those NYOL contracts that are subject to rights to terminate and the mark to market value of those contracts as of December 31, 2002: Potential Termination Date (1) Ounces of Gold Fair Value at December 31, 2002 (in millions) January, 2003 (336,000 ) $ (5.1 ) January, 2004 (780,000 ) 11.8 June, 2004 (133,335 ) (10.4 ) April, 2005 (840,000 ) (31.0 ) May, 2005 (195,000 ) (15.7 ) June, 2005 30,000 (12.0 ) August, 2005 (1,304,997 ) (105.7 ) October, 2006 (13.0 )(2) Total (3,559,332 ) $ (181.1 ) (1) Earliest possible termination date permitted under the contract. (2) This position, which forms part of the US$/Gold swap contracts, is with a different counterparty than the original swap transaction and has no ounces associated with it. Effective January 1, 2001, Newmont adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to recognize derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measurement at fair value. Unless specific hedging criteria are met, changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized currently in earnings. Gains and losses on derivative hedging instruments are recorded in either Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax or Net income (loss), depending on the nature of the instrument. Gold Commodity Contracts The tables below are expressed in thousands of ounces of gold, and prices for contracts denominated in A$ have been translated to US$ at the exchange rate at December 31, 2002 of US$0.56 per A$1. For all floating rate instruments, the average prices quoted are gross contractual prices. The net forward prices ultimately realized on floating gold hedging contracts are the sum of the gross contractual forward prices less any associated future financing costs arising from gold borrowing commitments related to such floating rate instruments. Floating put option valuations include a deferred premium cost, which is payable in gold ounces upon expiration of the options. 78 Table of Contents Gold Forward Sales Contracts Newmont had the following gold forward sales contracts at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Gold Forward Sales Contracts: 2003 2004 2004 2005 Thereafter Total/ Average Fair Value US$ (000) (A$ Denominated) Fixed Forwards: Ounces 1,022 1,060 227 52 26 2,387 $ (138,095 ) Average price $ 297 $ 300 $ 293 $ 266 $ 254 $ 297 Floating Rate Forwards: Ounces 61 231 214 506 $ (37,401 ) Average price $ $ $ 332 $ 342 $ 352 $ 345 Synthetic Forwards: Ounces 39 80 80 80 160 439 $ (34,222 ) Average price $ 313 $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 $ 306 Total: Ounces 1,061 1,140 368 363 400 3,332 $ (209,717 ) Average Price $ 298 $ 300 $ 302 $ 323 $ 327 $ 305 Notes: Fixed forward sales contracts provide for delivery of a specified number of ounces at a specified price and date and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Floating rate forward contracts provide for a gold lease rate component in the price that takes into account market lease rates over the term of the contract. Gold lease rates reflect the borrowing cost for gold. Variations in gold lease rates have historically not materially impacted on the actual realized price achieved on the contract. As such, these contracts have been statistically proven to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under FAS 133. Synthetic forward contracts represent combinations of purchased put options and written call options at the same strike price, maturity date and number of ounces. The combination achieves the same risk management result as gold forward sales contracts. Both floating rate forwards and synthetic forwards are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Gold Put Option Contracts Newmont had the following gold put option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Fair Value Gold Put Option Contracts: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total/ Average US$ (000) US$ Denominated Fixed Purchased Puts: Ounces 209 203 205 100 20 737 $ (6,774 ) Average price $ 292 $ 292 $ 292 $ 338 $ 397 $ 301 A$ Denominated Fixed Purchased Puts: Ounces 91 88 49 228 $ (3,690 ) Average price $ 312 $ 318 $ 309 $ $ $ 314 A$ Denominated Floating Purchased Puts: Ounces 16 207 69 287 579 $ (12,140 ) Average price $ 316 $ $ 332 $ 342 $ 344 $ 338 Total: Ounces 316 291 461 169 307 1,544 $ (22,603 ) Average Price $ 299 $ 300 $ 312 $ 340 $ 347 $ 317 Notes: Fixed purchased put option contracts provide the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified number of ounces at a specified strike price and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Floating forward purchased put option contracts provide for a variable gold lease rate component in the strike price. These options are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Variations in gold lease rates have historically not materially impacted on the actual realized price achieved on the contract. As such, these contracts have been statistically proven to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under FAS 133. 79 Table of Contents Gold Convertible Put Options and Other Instruments Newmont had the following gold convertible put option contracts and other instruments outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Fair Value Gold Convertible Put Optionsand Other Instruments: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total/Average US$ (000) (A$ Denominated) Floating Convertible Put Options: Ounces 1,131 1,131 $ (102,952 ) Average price $ $ $ $ $ 376 $ 376 Knock out/knock in Contracts: Ounces 46 37 49 132 $ (6,794 ) Average price $ 311 $ 311 $ 311 $ $ $ 311 Indexed Forward Contracts: Ounces 33 65 98 196 $ (15,740 ) Average price $ $ $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 $ 305 Total: Ounces 46 37 82 65 1,229 1,459 $ (125,486 ) Average price $ 311 $ 311 $ 308 $ 305 $ 371 $ 361 Notes: Convertible put option contracts and other instruments are composed of: a) Convertible option contracts that provide minimum price protection for covered ounces, while providing the opportunity to participate in higher market prices under certain market conditions, and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. (These contracts have a floating lease rate component. Variations in gold lease rates have historically not materially impacted on the actual realized price achieved on the contract. As such, these contracts have been statistically proven to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under FAS 133); b) Knock out/knock in option contracts are contingent sold call options that either terminate (or knock out) and maintain upside gold price potential or convert (or knock in) to sold call options, depending on certain market conditions, and are marked to market, with the change reflected in income; and c) Indexed forward contracts that are potentially convertible to purchased put options, depending on the market gold price at set future value dates during the term of the contract, and are marked to market, with the change reflected in income. Gold Sold Convertible Put Options Newmont had the following gold convertible put option contracts and other instruments outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Fair Value Gold Sold Convertible Put Options: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total/ Average US$ (000) (A$ Denominated) Ounces 30 60 60 90 240 $ (14,295 ) Average price $ $ 331 $ 334 $ 337 $ 340 $ 337 Notes: Sold convertible put options are contracts that commit Newmont to buy gold ounces under certain market conditions at a predetermined price on a specified future date. At December 31, 2002 Newmont had a sold gold convertible put position of 240,000 ounces. This position was originally overlaid with a bought convertible put position, however, the bought position was closed out during the year. As the contracts are to buy gold, they cannot be treated as cash flow hedges; they are therefore marked to market with the change reflected in income. The cash flow on the close out of this bought position was an outflow of $10.9 million. 80 Table of Contents Price Capped Sales Contracts Newmont had the following price capped forward sales contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Total/ Average Fair Value US$ (000) Price capped contracts: 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter (US$ Denominated) Ounces 500 1,850 2,350 n/a Average price $ $ $ 350 $ $ 384 $ 377 US$/Gold Swap Contracts Newmont Australia entered into a US$/gold swap contract whereby principal payments on US$ bonds are swapped into gold denominated payments of 600,000 ounces in 2008. Newmont Australia also receives US$ fixed interest payments and pays gold lease rates, which are indexed to spot prices. This instrument is marked to market at each period end, with the change reflected in income, and at December 31, 2002, the fair value was a negative $87.2 million. Other Sales Contracts, Commodity and Derivative Instruments Foreign Currency In addition to the U.S., Newmont has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Uzbekistan, Bolivia and Turkey. To the extent that there are fluctuations in local currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, the devaluation of a local currency is generally economically neutral or beneficial to most operations since local salaries and supply contracts will decrease against the U.S. dollar based revenue stream. The appreciation of non U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar can increase the costs of gold production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States, making such mines less profitable. Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) were $14.0 million, $(5.1) million and $(6.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Newmont acquired certain cross currency swap contracts in the Normandy transaction intended to hedge the currency risk on repayment of US$ denominated debt. These contracts were closed out during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 for net proceeds of $50.8 million. The contracts were accounted for on a mark to market basis until closed out, resulting in a loss to income of $8.5 million for the period from February 15, 2002 through December 31, 2002. Newmont also acquired currency swap contracts to receive A$ and pay US$ designated as hedges of A$ denominated debt. The A$ denominated debt was repaid during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and the contracts are currently undesignated. The contracts are accounted for on a mark to market basis. At December 31, 2002, they had a negative fair value of $21.9 million. At December 31, 2002, Newmont had the following foreign currency contracts outstanding. Prices for contracts denominated in A$ have been translated at the exchange rate at December 31, 2002 of US$0.56 per A$1. A$/US$ CurrencyExchange Contracts: Expected Maturity Date or Transaction Date Total/ Average Fair Value US$ (000) 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Notional Amounts US$ (000) $ 45,390 $ 56,112 $ 30,700 $ $ $ 132,201 $ (21,924 ) Average Exchange Rate (US$ per A$1) Average price 0.645 0.646 0.682 0.654 Interest Rate Swap Contracts In the Normandy transaction, Newmont acquired A$125 million of interest rate swap contracts covering a portion of its US$100 million, 7 year bonds. These contracts were closed out during the quarter ended 81 Table of Contents June 30, 2002 for a net cash out flow of $1 million. The contracts were accounted for on a mark to market basis until closed out, resulting in a gain of $0.4 million for the period from February 15, 2002 through December 31, 2002. During the last half of 2001, Newmont entered into contracts to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its $275 million 8.625% notes and its $200 million 8.375% debentures. Newmont receives fixed rate interest payments at 8.625% and 8.375% and pays floating rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 4.25%. The notional principal amount of these transactions (representing the amount of principal tied to floating interest rate exposure) was $200 million at December 31, 2002. Half of these contracts expire in July 2005 and half expire in May 2011. These transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $5.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These transactions have been designated as fair value hedges and had a positive fair value of $13.8 million at December 31, 2002 and a negative fair value of $0.6 million at December 31, 2001. Fixed Rate Debt Newmont has both fixed and variable rate debt. Without considering the specialized $145 million Prepaid Forward Sales Obligation, 93% and 90% of debt was fixed and 7% and 10% was variable at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has managed some of its fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (See Interest Rate Swap Contracts above). The Companys fixed rate debt exposure at December 31, 2002 and 2001 is summarized as follows: 2002 2001 (in millions) Carrying value of fixed rate debt* $ 976 $ 755 Fair value of fixed rate debt* $ 1,075 $ 766 Pro forma fair value sensitivity of fixed rate debt of a +/ 10 basis point interest rate change** $ +/ 3.7 $ +/ 2.8 * Excludes specialized and hybrid debt instruments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair values and pro forma fair values or sensitivities. These instruments include the Sale Leaseback of the Refractory Ore Treatment Plant, Newmont Yandal 8 7/8% notes, Prepaid Forward Sales Obligation, Minera Yanacocha Trust Certificates and certain capital leases. The estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments. ** The pro forma information assumes a +/ 10 basis point change in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. Actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions.
