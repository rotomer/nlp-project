Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes. Overview We are the largest online entertainment subscription service in the United States providing more than 1,000,000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 14,500 movie, television and other filmed entertainment titles. Our standard subscription plan allows subscribers to have three titles out at the same time with no due dates, late fees or shipping charges for $19.95 per month. Subscribers can view as many titles as they want in a month. Subscribers select titles at our Web site (www.netflix.com) aided by our proprietary recommendation service, receive them on DVD by first class mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. Once a title has been returned, we mail the next available title in a subscribers queue. We were organized as a Delaware corporation in August 1997. We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We may continue to incur losses, especially if the variable component of our stock based compensation increases as a result of increases in our stock price. On May 29, 2002, the Company closed the sale of 5,500,000 shares of common stock and on June 14, 2002, the Company closed the sale of an additional 825,000 shares of common stock, in an initial public offering at a price of $15.00 per share. A total of $94,875,000 in gross proceeds was raised from these transactions. After deducting the underwriting fee of approximately $6,641,000 and approximately $2,060,000 of other offering expenses, net proceeds were approximately $86,174,000. Upon the closing of the initial public offering, all preferred stock was automatically converted into common stock. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 11 statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Change in Estimated Life of the Cost of Our Library In late 2000 and early 2001, we entered into a series of revenue sharing agreements with studios, which substantially changed our business model for acquiring DVDs and satisfying subscriber demand for titles. These revenue sharing agreements enable us to acquire DVDs at a lower upfront cost than traditional buying arrangements. We share a percentage of the net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with these studios over a fixed period of time, generally 12 months. Before the change in our business model, we typically acquired fewer copies of a particular title and utilized each copy over a longer period of time. The implementation of these revenue sharing agreements improved our ability to acquire larger quantities of newly released titles and satisfy a substantial portion of subscriber demand for such titles over a shorter period of time. On January 1, 2001, we revised the amortization policy for the cost of our library from an accelerated method using a three year life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a one year life. The change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and is accounted for on a prospective basis from January 1, 2001. Had we continued to amortize the DVDs acquired prior to January 1, 2001 using a three year life, amortization expense for 2001 would have been $4.7 million lower than the amount recorded in our financial statements. Amortization of Upfront Costs of Our Library Under our revenue sharing agreements, we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios. This payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized. Certain of these payments also include a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is expensed as revenue sharing obligations are incurred. The initial fixed license fee is amortized on an accelerated basis over one year. We believe the use of an accelerated method is appropriate because we normally experience heavy initial demand for a title, which subsides once initial demand has been satisfied. Revenues We derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees. From the launch of our Web site in April 1998 through January 1999, we generated revenues primarily from individual DVD rentals and sales to customers. In March 1999, we stopped selling new DVDs. From February 1999 through October 1999, we generated revenues primarily from individual DVD rentals to customers. In September 1999, we launched our subscription service, and through February 2000, for a fixed monthly subscription fee of $15.95, subscribers could have up to four titles per month with no due dates or late fees, and for $3.98, could order an additional title. In February 2000, we modified our standard subscription service to provide subscribers access to an unlimited number of titles for $19.95 per month, with a maximum of four titles out at any time. Existing subscribers were switched to our new service, some at $15.95 per month and the rest at $19.95 per month. In October 2000, we again modified our standard subscription service to provide subscribers access to an unlimited number of titles for a fixed monthly fee, with a maximum of three titles out at the same time. There is no minimum subscription period and subscribers can cancel our service at any time. We had no DVD sales in 2000 and insignificant amounts in 2001 and 2002. Beginning in late 2000, as part of the change in our business model, we began acquiring larger quantities of particular titles through our revenue 12 sharing agreements. As a result, once initial demand for a particular title has been satisfied, we may hold a number of titles in excess of the quantities needed to satisfy ongoing subscriber demand. Several studios allow us to sell the DVDs acquired from them at the end of the revenue sharing term. Before we sell a particular title, we compare the number of copies we hold to estimated future demand to determine the number of copies we can sell without jeopardizing our ability to satisfy future subscriber demand. From time to time, we expect to make bulk sales of our used DVDs to resellers. We recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscribers monthly subscription period. We record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues or deferred revenues, as appropriate. We recognize revenues from the sale of used DVDs to resellers when the DVDs are shipped to the reseller. Historically, revenues from DVD rentals and shipping revenues also were recognized when the product was shipped to the customer. In addition to our standard service, we also offer subscribers other service plans and price points that allow subscribers to keep either fewer or more titles and range in subscription price. Approximately 90% of our paying subscribers pay $19.95 or more per month. Cost of Revenues Cost of Subscription Revenues We acquire titles for our library using traditional buying methods and revenue sharing agreements. Traditional buying methods normally result in higher upfront costs when compared to titles obtained through revenue sharing agreements. Cost of subscription revenues consists of revenue sharing costs, amortization of our library, amortization of intangible assets related to equity instruments issued to certain studios and postage and packaging costs related to shipping titles to paying subscribers. Revenue sharing costs. Our revenue sharing agreements generally commit us to pay an initial upfront fee for each DVD acquired. Revenue sharing expense is recorded as DVDs subject to revenue sharing agreements are shipped to subscribers. Under certain of our revenue sharing agreements, we pay an additional minimum revenue sharing fee for each DVD shipped to a subscriber. Other than the initial upfront payment for DVDs acquired, we are not obligated to pay any minimum revenue sharing fee on DVDs that are not shipped to subscribers. We characterize these payments to the studios as revenue sharing costs. As of December 31, 2002, we had revenue sharing agreements with over 50 studios. Amortization of the cost of DVDs. On January 1, 2001, we revised the estimated life to one year and assumed a salvage value of $2.00 for the DVDs that we believe we will eventually sell. Prior to January 1, 2001, we amortized our cost of DVDs using an accelerated method over an estimated life of three years and assumed no salvage value. Amortization of intangible assets related to equity issued to studios. In 2000, in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment, Dreamworks International Distribution and Warner Home Video, we agreed to issue each of these studios an amount of our Series F Non Voting Preferred Stock equal to 1.204% of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding. In 2001, in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment and Universal Studios Home Video, we agreed to issue to each of the two studios an amount of our Series F Non Voting Preferred Stock equal to 1.204% of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate of Series F Non Voting Preferred Stock granted to these five studios equaled 6.02% of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding. Our obligation to maintain the studios equity interests at 6.02% of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding terminated immediately prior to our initial public offering. The studios Series F Preferred Stock automatically converted into 1,596,415 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering. We measured the original issuances and any subsequent adjustments using the fair value of the securities at the issuance and any subsequent adjustment dates. The fair value was recorded as an intangible asset 13 and is amortized to cost of subscription revenues ratably over the remaining term of the agreements which initial terms were either three or five years. Postage and packaging. Postage and packaging costs consist of the postage costs to mail titles to and from our paying subscribers, each of which was $0.34 through June 29, 2002 and increased to $0.37 on June 30, 2002, and the packaging and label costs for the mailers. Cost of Sales Revenues Cost of revenues for DVD sales includes the salvage value for used DVDs sold and, historically, cost of merchandise sold to customers. Operating Expenses Fulfillment Fulfillment expense represents those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our distribution and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing our library. Fulfillment expense also includes credit card fees and other collection related expenses. Through December 2001, we maintained only one distribution center in San Jose, California. As of December 31, 2002, we were operating from 13 shipping centers located throughout the United States, including our San Jose operations. During 2003, we anticipate opening between 10 to 15 additional shipping centers to continue to reduce delivery times and increase library utilization. Technology and Development Technology and development expense consists of payroll and related expenses we incur related to testing, maintaining and modifying our Web site, our recommendation service, telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internal use software systems. Technology and development expense also includes depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our Web site and store our data. We continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers experience. We expect to continue to invest in technology and improvements in our Web site and internal use software, and as a result, we expect our technology and development expense will continue to increase. We have capitalized technology and development related expenses of $1.3 million in 2000, $1.2 million in 2001 and $1.2 million in 2002. The capitalized amounts are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated period of benefit of each improvement, generally one year. Marketing Marketing expense consists of marketing expenditures and other promotional activities, including revenue sharing costs, postage and packaging costs and library amortization costs related to free trial periods. In the second half of 2001, we implemented several new subscriber acquisition activities which provide incentives in the form of pay for performance payments for each new subscriber provided to us. We anticipate that our marketing expense will increase in future periods as a result of the overall growth in our subscriber base, free trial offers and pay for performance arrangements. General and Administrative General and administrative expense consists of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance, content acquisition and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. 14 Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation for equity instruments issued to employees represents the aggregate difference, at the grant date, between the respective exercise price of stock options or stock grants and the fair market value of the underlying stock less forfeitures. Stock based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options or grants based on an accelerated amortization method. In 2001, we offered our employees and directors the right to exchange certain stock options. We exchanged options to purchase approximately 900,000 shares of common stock with varying exercise prices in exchange for options to purchase approximately 900,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.00. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 635,000 of these options were outstanding. The stock option exchange resulted in variable award accounting treatment for all of the exchanged options. Variable award accounting will continue until all options subject to variable accounting are exercised, cancelled or expire. Variable accounting treatment will result in unpredictable and potentially significant charges or credits to our operating expenses from fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. For each hypothetical one dollar increase or decrease in the fair value of our common stock, we will record deferred compensation in an amount equal to the number of shares underlying the variable awards multiplied by the one dollar change. However, to the extent these variable awards are not fully vested, our stock compensation expense will be less than the amount we record as deferred compensation. For example, if at December 31, 2002 the fair value of our common stock had increased or decreased by $1.00, our deferred stock based compensation would change by approximately $0.6 million and our stock based compensation expense would be affected by approximately $0.3 million. Once these variable awards become fully vested, our stock based compensation will be affected on a dollar for dollar basis and a change in our stock price will directly impact the amount we record as stock based compensation in an amount equal to the number of shares underlying the variable awards outstanding multiplied by the change in the fair value of our common stock. For example, assuming all 635,000 exchanged options are fully vested and outstanding and assuming an increase or decrease in the fair value of our common stock of $1.00 in a quarter, our stock based compensation expense or credit related to the variable awards for that quarter would be $0.6 million. As of December 31, 2002, most of these variable awards were not fully vested and had a variety of final vesting dates over the next two years. 15 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2000 2001 2002 Revenues: Subscription 100.0 % 97.8 % 98.7 % Sales 2.2 1.3 Total revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Subscription 69.3 64.7 50.4 Sales 1.1 0.7 Total cost of revenues 69.3 65.8 51.1 Gross profit 30.7 34.2 48.9 Operating expenses: Fulfillment 28.5 17.7 12.7 Technology and development 46.9 23.4 9.6 Marketing 71.7 27.7 23.4 General and administrative 19.5 6.1 4.4 Restructuring charges 0.9 Stock based compensation 24.5 7.5 6.4 Total operating expenses 191.1 83.3 56.5 Operating loss (160.4 ) (49.1 ) (7.6 ) Other income (expense): Interest and other income 4.6 0.6 1.1 Interest and other expense (4.0 ) (2.4 ) (7.8 ) Net loss (159.8 )% (50.9 )% (14.3 )% Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2002 Revenues Subscription revenues. Our subscription revenues increased from $74.3 million in 2001 to $150.8 million in 2002, representing a 103% increase. This increase was driven primarily by a 103% increase in the average number of subscribers between 2001 and 2002. We believe the increase in the number of subscribers was caused by our unrivalled selection of titles, consistently high levels of subscriber satisfaction, the rapid consumer adoption of DVD players and our increasingly effective marketing programs. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues increased by $27.9 million from $49.1 million in 2001 to $77.0 million in 2002, representing a 57% increase. This increase was attributable primarily to a 117% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to our subscribers which was driven by a 104% increase in average paying subscribers. Our DVD amortization costs decreased by $4.2 million, representing a 21% decrease. The decrease was attributable primarily to a $4.7 million increase in amortization in 2001, which was caused by the change in the estimated life of our DVD library from three years to one year effective January 1, 2001, partially offset by an increase in amortization related to increased acquisitions for our library. Our revenue sharing costs increased by $16.8 million, representing a 132% increase. This increase was due 16 primarily to a modest increase in the percentage of titles subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to our subscribers. Our postage and packaging costs increased by $14.5 million, representing a 99% increase. Our postage rate per title in 2002 was lower than 2001, notwithstanding the rate for first class postage increasing to $0.37 from $0.34 on June 30, 2002. This postage rate per title decrease was attributable primarily to a full year benefit of reduced postage per title as a result of packaging improvements completed during the second quarter of 2001. Our amortization of intangible assets increased by $0.8 million, representing a 43% increase. The increase in amortization was attributable to increases in intangible assets caused by our obligation to issue additional shares to these studios upon dilution, which ceased immediately prior to our initial public offering. Gross profit. Our gross profit increased from $26.0 million in 2001 to $74.7 million in 2002, representing 34.3% and 48.9% of revenues, respectively. Our gross profit percentages increased primarily as a result of the growth in our subscription revenues and a decrease in our direct incremental costs of providing those subscription services, coupled with the 21% reduction in DVD amortization costs in 2002 as compared to 2001. Operating Expenses Fulfillment. Fulfillment expenses increased from $13.5 million in 2001 to $19.4 million in 2002, representing a 44% increase. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in the overall volume of the activities of our fulfillment operations and an increase in credit card fees from $3.2 million in 2001 to $4.9 million in 2002. As a percentage of revenues, fulfillment expense decreased from 17.7% in 2001 to 12.7% in 2002 due primarily to a combination of an increasing revenue base and substantial improvements in our fulfillment productivity due to our continuous efforts to refine and streamline our fulfillment operations, and a reduction in credit cards fees as a percentage of revenues from 4.2% in 2001 to 3.2% in 2002. The rate of improvement in our fulfillment productivity may decrease in future periods as we reach diminishing marginal returns on the refinements and streamlining efforts to our operations. Credit card fees increased due to an increase in subscription revenues. Technology and development. Technology and development expenses decreased from $17.7 million in 2001 to $14.6 million in 2002, representing an 18% decrease. This decrease was caused primarily by decreases in personnel costs as a result of employees terminated as part of our restructuring in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, technology and development expenses decreased from 23.4% in 2001 to 9.6% in 2002 due primarily to an increase in revenues and a decrease in the absolute dollar amount we spent on technology and development. Marketing. Our marketing expenses increased from $21.0 million in 2001 to $35.8 million in 2001, representing a 70% increase. This increase was attributable primarily to a 101% increase in the number of new trial subscribers in 2002 compared to 2001, partially offset by decreases in the marketing cost per acquired subscriber from $37.16 to $31.39. The decrease in the cost per acquired subscriber was due primarily to costs related to free trials and marketing staff and other costs increasing only moderately in absolute dollars but declining 16% on a per acquired subscriber basis due to the large increase in new trial subscribers. As a percentage of revenues, marketing expenses decreased from 27.7% in 2001 to 23.4% in 2002 due primarily to an increase in revenues. General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses increased from $4.7 million in 2001 to $6.7 million in 2002, representing a 45% increase. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of personnel to support our increasing subscriber base as well as increased directors and officers insurance and property insurance costs and additional professional fees caused by public company filing requirements. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased from 6.1% in 2001 to 4.4% in 2002 due primarily to an increase in revenues. Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense increased from $5.7 million, consisting of $5.3 million related to fixed awards and $0.4 million related to variable awards, in 2001 to $9.8 million, consisting of $7.8 million related to fixed awards and $2.0 million related to variable awards, in 2002. 17 The increase in the fixed award compensation expense was attributable to the issuance of options in 2002, prior to our initial public offering, with exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock. Since our initial public offering, there is no longer any difference between fair market value and the exercise price for new option grants and as a result no new deferred stock based compensation has or is expected to arise from new awards. Consequently, we expect our future stock based compensation expense will relate to existing awards. The increase in stock based compensation expense related to variable awards was due to a full year of vesting for the variable awards, repriced in August of 2001, as compared to a partial year of vesting in 2001 partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of our common stock during 2002. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other expense, net increased substantially from ($1.4 million) in 2001 to ($10.3 million) in 2002. This increase was attributable primarily to a one time non cash charge of $10.7 million associated with our early repayment, triggered by the consummation of our initial public offering in May 2002, of all outstanding indebtedness under our subordinated promissory notes related to the acceleration of the accretion of the unamortized discount. Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Revenues Subscription revenues. Our subscription revenues increased from $35.9 million in 2000 to $74.3 million in 2001, representing a 107% increase. This increase was driven primarily by an 88% increase in the average number of subscribers between 2000 and 2001. We believe the increase in the number of subscribers was caused by our unrivalled selection of titles, consistently high levels of subscriber satisfaction, the rapid consumer adoption of DVD players and our increasingly effective marketing programs. In addition, part of the increase was due to a $4.00 increase in the monthly subscription fee charged to some of our subscribers beginning in October 2000. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues increased by $24.2 million from $24.9 million in 2000 to $49.1 million in 2001, representing a 97% increase. This increase was attributable primarily to 82% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to our subscribers which was driven by a 94% increase in average paying subscribers. Our revenue sharing costs increased by $11.4 million, representing a 816% increase. This increase was due primarily to a substantial increase in the percentage of titles subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to our subscribers. Our DVD amortization costs increased by $8.1 million, representing a 70% increase. This increase was attributable primarily to the decrease in the period over which we amortize the cost of our library. Our postage and packaging costs increased by $3.3 million, representing a 29% increase. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of DVDs mailed to our subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in the postage rate per title as a result of packaging improvements. Our amortization of intangible assets increased by $1.4 million, representing a 321% increase. This increase was attributable to a full year of amortization in 2001 as compared to a partial year of amortization in 2000, additional deferred charges for two new revenue sharing agreements in 2001 and increases in deferred charges caused by our obligation to issue additional equity securities to these studios. Gross profit. Our gross profit increased from $11.0 million in 2000 to $26.0 million in 2001, representing a 136% increase and gross profit percentages of 31% in 2000 and 34% in 2001. Our gross profit percentages increased primarily as a result of the growth in our subscription revenues and a decrease in our direct incremental costs of providing those subscription services. 18 Operating Expenses Fulfillment. Fulfillment expenses increased from $10.2 million in 2000 to $13.5 million in 2001, representing a 31% increase. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in the overall volume of the activities of our primary fulfillment center and an increase in credit card fees from $1.6 million in 2000 to $3.2 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, fulfillment expenses decreased from 29% in 2000 to 18% in 2001 primarily due to a combination of an increasing revenue base and improvements in our fulfillment productivity due to our continuous efforts to refine and streamline our fulfillment operations. Credit card fees increased due to an increase in subscription revenues. Technology and development. Excluding capitalized software development costs, our technology and development expenses increased from $16.8 million in 2000 to $17.7 million in 2001, representing a 5% increase. This increase was primarily the result of our investment in storing data, handling large increases in traffic on our Web site and maintaining and modifying our software related to our Web site, our recommendation service and our internal software infrastructure. As a percentage of revenues, technology and development expenses decreased from 47% in 2000 to 23% in 2001 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues. Marketing. Our marketing expenses decreased from $25.7 million in 2000 to $21.0 million in 2001, representing an 18% decrease. This decrease was primarily attributable to scaling back the number of free trial offers for part of 2001 and a reduction in our free trial offer period of 30 days to typically 14 days for the balance of 2001. As a percentage of revenues, marketing expenses decreased from 72% in 2000 to 28% in 2001 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues. General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses decreased from $7.0 million in 2000 to $4.7 million in 2001, representing a 33% decrease. This decrease was primarily attributable to our cost containment efforts in 2001 and the $1.3 million one time cost of our withdrawn public offering in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased from 20% in 2000 to 6% in 2001 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues. Restructuring. In 2001, we recorded a restructuring expense of $0.7 million relating to severance payments made to 45 employees we terminated in an effort to restructure our organization to streamline our processes and reduce expenses. We had no restructuring expense in prior years. Stock based compensation. Our stock based compensation expenses decreased from $8.8 million in 2000 to $5.7 million in 2001, representing a 35% decrease. This decrease was primarily attributable to reduced charges caused by utilization of the graded vesting method of stock compensation amortization and fewer options issued at exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net We had interest and other income, net of $0.2 million in 2000 and interest and other expense, net of ($1.4 million) in 2001. The change between 2000 and 2001 was attributable primarily to a decrease in interest income caused by a decrease in our interest bearing cash balances and additional interest charges caused by the issuance of subordinated notes payable with a face amount of $13.0 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our activities primarily through a series of private placements of convertible preferred stock, subordinated promissory notes and our initial public offering. As of December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents of $59.8 million and short term investments of $43.8 million. Although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our May 2002 public offering, together with our available funds and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require additional financing. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development 19 efforts, business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. See Risks Related to Our Business and Risks Related to Our Ownership. Net cash used in operating activities was $22.7 million in 2000. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.8 million in 2001 and $40.1 million in 2002. Net cash used in operating activities in 2000 was primarily attributable to a net loss of $57.4 million and an increase in prepaid and other current assets, partially offset by deferred compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non cash interest expenses, increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2001 was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, a decrease in operating expenses and an increase in accounts payable. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was attributable primarily to a $16.7 million reduction in net loss due to revenues growing at a much faster rate than operating expenses, offset by a $3.3 million reduction in depreciation and amortization, a $4.1 million increase in non cash stock based compensation, a $10.4 million increase in non cash interest expense, and a $9.3 million increase in operating assets and liabilities, offset by a $1.7 million gain on disposal of used DVDs. Net cash used in investing activities was $25.0 million in 2000, $12.7 million in 2001 and $67.3 million in 2002. Net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was primarily attributable to our acquisition of titles for our library and property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of short term investments. Net cash used in investing activities in 2001 was primarily attributable to our acquisition of titles for our library and property and equipment. The 63% decrease in cash used to acquire DVDs in 2001 from 2000, primarily reflects the reduced cash requirements to acquire DVDs under our revenue sharing agreements. Net cash used in investing activities in 2002 was attributable primarily to a $43.0 million purchase of short term investments with a portion of our initial public offering proceeds and $24.1 million related to the acquisition of titles for our DVD library. While DVD acquisition expenditures are classified as cash flows from investing activities you may wish to consider these together with cash flows from operating activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $48.4 million in 2000, $9.1 million in 2001 and $70.9 million in 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2000 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, partially offset by payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of common stock warrants and subordinated promissory notes, partially offset by payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2002 was attributable primarily to proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering that raised net proceeds of $86.2 million, partially offset by the repayment of $14.2 million on our subordinated notes payable and $2.9 million on our other notes payable and capital lease obligations. Commitments and Contingencies We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as December 31, 2002. We have lease obligations under noncancelable operating leases and capital leases with various expiration dates through March 2005. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases as of December 31, 2002, are as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December 31, Capital Leases Operating Leases 2003 $ 1,326 $ 2,952 2004 462 2,640 2005 56 1,466 Total minimum payments $ 1,844 $ 7,058 20 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from acquisition, construction, development, and or normal use of the assets. We also will record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS 146 will be effective in 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 02 16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor, addressing the accounting of cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor, including vendor rebates and refunds. The consensus reached states that consideration received should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendors products or services and should therefore be shown as a reduction of cost of sales in the income statement of the customer. The presumption could be overcome if the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration or the consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the customer in selling the vendors product or service. If one of these conditions is met, the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of those costs in the income statement of the customer. The consensus reached also concludes that if rebates or refunds can be reasonably estimated, such rebates or refunds should be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration to be received relative to the transactions that mark the progress of the customer toward earning the rebate or refund. The provisions of this consensus are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or operating results. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, addressing how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; (2) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and (3) delivery of any undelivered item is probable. Arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. The final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this consensus are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or operating results. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. This initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 21 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51. This Interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the Interpretation. The Interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For public enterprises, such as us, with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before February 1, 2003, the Interpretation is applied to the enterprise no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The application of this Interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. The Interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003 if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the Interpretation becomes effective. Factors that May Affect future Results of Operations If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business If our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful, our revenues will be affected adversely. We must continue to attract and retain subscribers. To succeed, we must continue to attract a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used video retailers, video rental outlets, pay cable channels, such as HBO and Showtime, and pay per view and video on demand, or VOD, for in home filmed entertainment. Our ability to attract and retain subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers a high quality experience for selecting, viewing, receiving and returning titles, including providing accurate recommendations through our recommendation service. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of high quality, or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers. In addition, many of our new subscribers originate from word of mouth advertising and referrals from existing subscribers. If our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to attract new subscribers, and as a result, our revenues will be affected adversely. We rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our DVDs and to manage other aspects of our operations, and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business. We use complex proprietary software to process deliveries and returns of our DVDs and to manage other aspects of our operations. Our proprietary technology is intended to allow our shipping centers throughout the United States to be operated on an integrated basis. We continually enhance or otherwise modify the software used for our distribution operations. For example, in early 2003 we introduced new software algorithms and procedures designed to enhance local delivery of available DVDs to our subscribers and to otherwise provide operational efficiencies at our shipping centers. We cannot be sure that the enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers. If we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of DVDs among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner, our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired. If we are not able to manage our growth, our business could be affected adversely. We have expanded rapidly since we launched our Web site in April 1998. We anticipate further expanding our operations to help grow our subscriber base and to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. Any 22 future expansion will likely place significant demands on our managerial, operational, administrative and financial resources. If we are not able to respond effectively to new or increased demands that arise because of our growth, or, if in responding, our management is materially distracted from our current operations, our business may be affected adversely. In addition, if we do not have sufficient breadth and depth of the titles necessary to satisfy increased demand arising from growth in our subscriber base, our subscriber satisfaction may be affected adversely. In 2002, we opened approximately 12 shipping centers throughout the United States. We currently plan to open approximately 10 to 15 additional shipping centers in 2003. Although we have a limited history in operating our shipping centers, we have seen a decrease in the delivery and return time for DVDs to those subscribers serviced by the shipping centers. In addition, we have experienced an increase in the exchange of titles by subscribers in those areas. The more frequent exchange of titles has increased our shipping and delivery costs and revenue sharing expenses while at the same time, along with other enhancements to our service, resulted in improved subscriber retention. If the improved retention is not maintained or improved as necessary to offset the costs resulting from any increased usage, or if other mitigating factors do not offset such costs, our operating results will be adversely affected. We have no experience offering our subscription service outside the United States. If we offer our service outside the United States, we will need to focus substantial resources to handling operations in a foreign environment, including addressing issues related to foreign labor markets and the regulatory environments. As a result, our managerial, operational, administrative and financial resources may be strained. Any international expansion may not achieve the subscriber acquisition or operating results anticipated by us at the time we determine to expand our operations internationally. If we experience excessive rates of subscriber churn, our revenues and business will be harmed. We must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers. Subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, delivery takes too long, the service is a poor value and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to continue to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base. If too many of our subscribers cancel our service, or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, our operating results will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers. We have a limited operating history and history of net losses, and we may experience net losses in the future. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in their early stage of development. We have experienced significant net losses since our inception and, given the significant operating and capital expenditures associated with our business plan, we may experience net losses in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such profitability. We incurred net losses of $21.9 million for the year ended 2002. Our operating results are expected to be difficult to predict based on a number of factors that also will affect our long term performance. We expect our operating results to fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and difficult to predict. As a result, period to period comparisons of our operating results may 23 not be a good indicator of our future or long term performance. The following factors may affect us from period to period and may affect our long term performance: our ability to manage our fulfillment processes to handle significant increases in the number of subscribers and subscriber selections; our ability to improve or maintain gross margins in our business; changes by our competitors to their product and service offerings; price competition; our ability to maintain an adequate breadth and depth of titles; our ability to manage our inventory levels; changes in promotional support offered by studios; our ability to maintain, upgrade and develop our Web site, our internal computer systems and our fulfillment processes and utilize efficiently our shipping centers; fluctuations in consumer spending on DVD players, DVDs and related products; fluctuations in the use of the Internet for the purchase of consumer goods and services such as those offered by us; technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet disruptions; our ability to attract new and qualified personnel in a timely and effective manner and retain existing personnel; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; our ability to effectively manage the development of new business segments and markets; our ability to maintain and develop new and existing marketing relationships; our ability to successfully manage the integration of operations and technology resulting from acquisitions; governmental regulation and taxation policies; and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the Internet, online commerce and the movie industry. In addition to these factors, our operating results may fluctuate based upon seasonal fluctuations in DVD player sales and in the use of the Internet. During our limited operating history, we have experienced greater additions of new subscribers during late fall and the winter months, and these seasonal fluctuations may continue in future periods. If our efforts to build strong brand identity, and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers, and our operating results will be affected adversely. The Netflix brand is young, and we must continue to build strong brand identity. To succeed, we must continue to attract and retain a large number of owners of DVD players who have traditionally relied on store based rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service through our Web site. We may be required to incur significantly higher advertising and promotional expenditures than we currently anticipate to attract large numbers of new subscribers. We believe that the importance of brand loyalty will increase with a proliferation of DVD subscription services and other means of distributing titles, such as VOD. If our branding efforts are not successful, our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers will be affected adversely. 24 If we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the U.S. mail system, we could lose subscribers, which could adversely affect our operating results. We rely exclusively on the U.S. Postal Service to deliver DVDs from our shipping centers and to return DVDs to us from our subscribers. We are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs, including delays caused by bioterrorism, potential labor activism and inclement weather. For example, in the fall of 2001 terrorists used the U.S. Postal Service to deliver envelopes containing Anthrax, following which mail deliveries around the United States experienced significant delays. Our DVDs also are subject to risks of breakage during delivery and handling by the U.S. Postal Service. The risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our DVDs. If the entities replicating our DVDs use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we otherwise fail to timely deliver DVDs to our subscribers, our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service, which could adversely affect our operating results and increased breakage rates for our DVDs will increase our cost of acquiring titles. Increases in the cost of delivering DVDs could adversely affect our gross profit and marketing expenses. Increases in postage delivery rates will adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription rates to offset the increase. For example, in June 2002, the rate for first class postage increased from $0.34 to $0.37 which increase will directly impact our cost of shipping DVDs. In addition, the U.S. Postal Service has announced long term plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient. If the Postal Service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of first class mail, including changes in size, weight or machinability qualifications, such changes could result in increased shipping costs for our DVDs and our gross profit could be affected adversely. Also, if the U.S. Postal Service curtails its services, such as by the discontinuation of Saturday delivery service, our ability to timely deliver DVDs could diminish, and our subscriber satisfaction could be affected adversely. Currently, most filmed entertainment is packaged on a single lightweight DVD. Our delivery process is designed to accommodate the delivery of one DVD to fulfill a selection. Because of the lightweight nature of a DVD, we generally mail one envelope containing a title using standard first class postage. However, studios occasionally provide additional content on a second DVD, or may package a title on two DVDs. If packaging of filmed entertainment on multiple DVDs were to become more prevalent, or if the weight of DVDs were to increase, our costs of delivery and fulfillment processing would increase. In addition, we expense shipping costs of free trial programs to new subscribers as marketing expense. Therefore, if the cost of delivering titles were to increase, our marketing expense would be adversely affected. If we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service, our business may suffer. Based on proprietary algorithms, our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandize our library to our subscribers. We believe that in order for our recommendation service to function most effectively, it must access a large database of user ratings. We cannot assure you that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles. We are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and therefore its usefulness to our subscribers. We may experience difficulties in implementing such refinements. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we did not launch a new version of our recommendation service due to implementation difficulties. While we did launch the new version in the first quarter of 2003, we cannot assure you that we will be will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service. 25 If our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements, our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful, in which event: our subscriber satisfaction may decrease, subscribers may perceive our service to be of lower value and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be affected adversely; our ability to effectively merchandise and utilize our library will be affected adversely; and our subscribers may default to choosing titles from among new releases or other titles that cost us more to provide, and our margins may be affected adversely. If we do not correctly anticipate our short and long term needs for titles that we acquire pursuant to revenue sharing agreements, our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be affected adversely. Under our revenue sharing agreements, we generally pre order titles prior to their release on DVD based on our anticipated needs. If we anticipate inaccurately and we acquire insufficient copy depth for specific titles, it is generally impracticable for us to acquire additional copy depth for such titles while such titles are subject to revenue sharing. If we do not acquire sufficient copies of titles, we may not satisfy subscriber demand, and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be affected adversely. Conversely, if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand, then our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be affected adversely. If our subscribers select titles that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver on a more frequent basis, our expenses would increase. Certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are acquired and the terms on which they are acquired. If subscribers select these more costly titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected, our revenue sharing and other DVD acquisition expenses could increase, and our gross margins could be adversely affected. If we are unable to offset increased demand for titles with increased subscriber retention or operating margins, our operating results may be affected adversely. Subscribers to our service can view as many titles as they want every month and, depending on the service plan, may have out between two and eight titles at a time. Currently we operate 18 shipping centers and plan to open additional centers in 2003. With our use of these shipping centers and the associated software and procedural upgrades, there has been a reduction in the transit time of DVDs. As a result, our subscribers have been able to exchange more titles per month, which has increased our operating costs. As we rollout additional shipping centers or further refine our distribution process, we may see an increase in usage by our subscribers. If our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of increased operating costs, our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, subscriber demand for titles may increase for a variety of other reasons beyond our control, including promotion by studios and seasonal variations in movie watching. Our subscriber growth and retention may be affected adversely if we attempt to increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business will be affected adversely. The market for in home filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in home filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. For example, consumers may subscribe to HBO, rent a DVD 26 from Blockbuster, buy a DVD from Wal Mart and subscribe to Netflix, or some combination thereof, all in the same month. Competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost. DVDs represent only one of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing filmed entertainment. In addition, the growth in adoption of DVD technology is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors and technologies, we may not be able to achieve adequate market share, increase our revenues, or achieve and maintain profitability. Our principal competitors include, or could include: video rental outlets, such as Blockbuster and Hollywood Entertainment; movie retail stores, such as Best Buy, Wal Mart and Amazon.com; subscription entertainment services, such as HBO and Showtime; pay per view and video on demand services; online DVD sites, such as FilmCaddy.com and Walmart.com; Internet movie providers, such as Movielink, backed by Columbia TriStar, Warner Bros. and a few other studios, Movies.com, backed by Walt Disney, CinemaNow.com, backed by Blockbuster and Microsoft, and Movie Flix; cable providers, such as AOL Time Warner and Comcast; and direct broadcast satellite providers, such as DirectTV and Echostar. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and Web site and systems development than we do. The rapid growth of our online entertainment subscription business since our inception may attract direct competition from larger companies with significantly greater financial resources and national brand recognition. In October of 2002, Wal Marts online affiliate Walmart.com announced that it was testing an online DVD subscription service, Wal Mart DVD Rentals, and that based on the result of such test, would likely rollout a service nationwide in 2003. Likewise, Blockbuster recently acquired an online DVD subscription service, FilmCaddy.com. Blockbuster is also testing in store DVD rental subscription programs. Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and reduced revenues. In addition, our competitors may form or extend strategic alliances with studios and distributors that could affect adversely our ability to obtain filmed entertainment on favorable terms. If consumer adoption of DVD players slows, our business could be adversely affected. The rapid adoption of DVD players has been fueled by strong retail support, strong studio support and falling DVD player prices. If retailers or studios reduce their support of the DVD format, or if manufacturers raise prices, continued DVD adoption by consumers could slow. If new or existing technologies, such as D VHS, were to become more popular at the expense of the adoption or use of DVD technology, consumers may delay or avoid purchasing a DVD player. Our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by future consumer adoption of DVD players, and if such adoption slows, our subscriber growth may also slow. We depend on studios to release titles on DVD for an exclusive time period following theatrical release. Our ability to attract and retain subscribers is related to our ability to offer new releases of filmed entertainment on DVD prior to their release to other distribution channels. Except for theatrical release, DVD and VHS currently enjoy a significant competitive advantage over other distribution channels, such as pay per view and VOD, because of the early timing of the distribution window for DVD and VHS. The window for DVD and VHS rental and retail sales is generally exclusive against other forms of non theatrical movie distribution, such as pay per view, premium television, basic cable and network and syndicated television. The length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. 27 Our business could suffer increased competition if: the window for rental were no longer the first following the theatrical release; or the length of this window were shortened. The order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the title, and we cannot assure you that the studios will not change their policies in the future in a manner that would be adverse to our business and results of operations. In addition, any conditions that adversely affect the movie industry, including constraints on capital, financial difficulties, regulatory requirements and strikes, work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers, actors or other essential personnel, could affect adversely the availability of new titles, consumer demand for filmed entertainment and our business. If we are unable to renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us, or if the cost to us of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis increases, our gross margins may be affected adversely. Since 2000, we have entered into over 50 revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors. These revenue sharing agreements generally have terms of up to five years. The length of time we share revenue on each title ends after a fixed period. As our revenue sharing agreements expire, we may be required to negotiate new terms that could be disadvantageous to us. During the course of our revenue sharing relationship with studios and distributors, various contract administration issues arise. To the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner, our relationship with the studios may be adversely impacted. Titles that we do not acquire under a revenue sharing agreement are purchased on a wholesale basis from studios or other distributors. If the price of titles that we purchase wholesale increases, our gross margin will be affected adversely. If the sales price of DVDs to retail consumers decreases, our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely. The cost of manufacturing DVDs is substantially less than the price for which new DVDs are generally sold in the retail market. Thus, we believe that studios and other resellers of DVDs have significant flexibility in pricing DVDs for retail sale. If the retail price of DVDs were to become significantly lower, consumers may choose to purchase DVDs rather than subscribe to our service. If disposable DVDs are adopted and supported as a method of content delivery by the studios, our business could be adversely affected. Certain companies have developed disposable DVDs. As currently designed, disposable DVDs allow a consumer to view a DVD for an unlimited number of times during a given time period, following which the DVD becomes unplayable by a chemical reaction, and is then disposable. For example, in November of 2002, scenes from the newly release James Bond film, Die Another Day, were distributed to members of the media in a promotion of the movie. The discs were rendered unplayable 36 hours after being exposed to the air. If disposable DVDs become a viable alternative method of content delivery supported by the studios, our business could be adversely affected. 28 If we fail to maintain or adequately replace our outside sources of new subscribers or are unable to continue to market our service in the manner currently conducted, our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our marketing expenses may increase. We obtain a large portion of our new subscribers through incentive based online marketing programs. We engage third parties to solicit new subscribers through the use of banner ads, pop under placements, direct links and e mails. We also have an active affiliate program by which third parties register with us and obtain particular advertisements from us for use on their Web sites or through other online marketing forums. In addition, we have engaged in various offline incentive based marketing programs. For example, we obtain subscribers through solicitations placed inside the packaging of stand alone DVD players through arrangements we have with DVD player manufacturers. We have also explored other incentive based advertising channels including newspaper and television advertising. These third parties may not continue to participate in our marketing programs if the programs do not provide sufficient value for their participation, our competitors offer better terms or the market for incentive based advertising decreases. If we are unable to maintain or replace these sources of subscribers, our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our cost of marketing may increase. In addition, while the DVD player manufacturers with whom we have promotional relationships are required to include our promotional materials with every DVD player they sell, we cannot effectively control what portion of DVD players sold by them actually include the promotional materials. If these DVD player manufacturers do not fully comply with the terms of our promotional relationships, our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely. In addition, as these agreements expire, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these arrangements on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to continue our current marketing activities, our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely. We may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by e mail or other online means if such activities are adverse to our business. Laws or regulations may be enacted which prohibit use of e mails or similar marketing activities. Even if no relevant law or regulation is enacted, we may discontinue use or support of these activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem them intrusive or they otherwise adversely affect our goodwill and brand. For example, we recently terminated our relationship with certain e mail marketers who did not meet our e mail marketing standards which include that all recipients have given permission to receive e mail solicitations directly from the marketer. If these marketing activities are curtailed, our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely. We may need additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available. Historically, we have funded our operating losses and capital expenditures through proceeds from private equity and debt financings, equipment leases and cash flow from operations. Although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our May 2002 public offering, together with our available funds and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require additional financing. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any significant disruption in service on our Web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers. Subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our Web site, where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our Web site, network 29 infrastructure and fulfillment processes. Interruptions in these systems could make our Web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections. Much of our software is proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems. Service interruptions or the unavailability of our Web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers. Our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations and loss, misuse or theft of data. Our Web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service. Any attempts by hackers to disrupt our Web site service or our internal systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. Our general business disruption insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our Web site or internal systems. Efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services. Any significant disruption to our Web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our Web site are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider. Hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers. Fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, break ins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely. Problems faced by our third party Web hosting provider, with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its subscribers, including us, could impact adversely the experience of our subscribers. Any of these problems could result in a loss of subscribers. Our executive offices and San Jose based shipping center are located in the San Francisco Bay area. In the event of an earthquake, other natural or man made disaster or power loss, our operations would be affected adversely. Our executive offices and San Jose based distribution center, which houses our customer service operations and our excess DVD inventory, are located in the San Francisco Bay area. Our business and operations could be materially adversely affected in the event of electrical blackouts, fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, break ins or similar events. We may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations due to disruptions in service in the San Francisco Bay area or any other facility. Because the San Francisco Bay area is located in an earthquake sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our primary distribution center and the surrounding transportation infrastructure. We are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes. Further, the State of California has experienced deficiencies in its power supply over the last few years, resulting in occasional rolling black outs. If rolling blackouts or other disruptions in power occur, our business and operations would be disrupted, and our business would be affected adversely. The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could seriously harm our existing business and new service developments. We depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Reed Hastings, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, Barry McCarthy, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Thomas R. Dillon, our Vice President of Operations, Leslie J. Kilgore, our Vice President of Marketing, and Neil Hunt, our Vice President of E Commerce. In addition, much of our key technology and systems are custom made for our business by our personnel so that the loss of our key technology personnel could disrupt the operation of our title selection and fulfillment systems and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and expand our systems. 30 Privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data. In the ordinary course of business, and in particular, in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service, we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the Internet regarding users browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self regulation, as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business. Our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons. To secure transmission of confidential information obtained by us for billing purposes, including subscribers credit card data, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology. In conjunction with the credit card companies, we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers credit card and other data. If, despite these measures, we experienced any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers data, current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers, and our business could be affected adversely. Similarly, if a well publicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer Web site were to occur, there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the Internet for commerce transactions, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, because we obtain subscribers billing information on our Web site, we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them. Under current credit card practices, to the extent we do not obtain cardholders signatures, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions, even where the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders. From time to time, fraudulent credit cards are used on our site to obtain service and access our discs. Typically, these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards. While we do have a number of other safeguards in place, we do nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions. We do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions. A failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations. Our relationship with subscribers and credit card companies could be harmed if our billing software fails. We have in the past experienced problems with our subscriber billing software, causing us to overbill subscribers. Although we have and will continue to credit the accounts of the subscribers we overbill, problems with our billing software may have an adverse effect on our subscriber satisfaction and may cause one or more of the major credit companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if our billing software fails and we fail to bill subscribers our cash flow and results of operations will be affected adversely. If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. Netflix is a registered trademark of Netflix, Inc. We have also filed trademark applications in the United States for the Netflix.com, and CineMatch names, and for the Netflix design logo and have filed U.S. patent applications for aspects of our technology. We have also filed trademark applications in certain foreign countries for the Netflix name. From time to time we expect to file additional trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement 31 without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected. Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, our recommendation service, title selection processes and marketing activities. Trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content on our Web site. We use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights. From time to time, third parties allege our violation of intellectual property rights. If there is any claim against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights, and we are unable to obtain sufficient rights or develop non infringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices, as appropriate, on a timely basis, our business and competitive position may be affected adversely. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology. If we are forced to defend ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, inability to use our current Web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandizing or marketing activities or take other action to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, costly or unavailable. If we are unable to protect our domain names, our reputation and brand could be affected adversely. We currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could affect adversely our reputation and brand, and make it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain names in the United States may change in the near future. Governing bodies may establish additional top level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Because our business is accessed over the Internet, if the Internet infrastructure is not developed or maintained, we will lose subscribers. The Internet may not become a viable commercial marketplace for many potential subscribers due to inadequate development of network infrastructure and enabling technologies that address consumer concerns about: network performance; security; 32 reliability; speed of access; ease of use; and bandwidth availability. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could frustrate public use of the Internet, including use of our Web site offerings. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to governmental regulation. If we become subject to liability for the Internet content that we publish or upload from our users, our results of operations would be affected adversely. As a publisher of online content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our community related content or movie reviews. If we become liable, then our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and harm our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover claims of these types or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us. We may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses, if government regulation of the Internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the Internet change. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. The manner in which Internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the Internet could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business. In addition, if consumer attitudes toward use of the Internet change, consumers may become unwilling to select their entertainment online or otherwise provide us with information necessary for them to become subscribers. Further, we may not be able to effectively market our services online to users of the Internet. If we are unable to interact with consumers because of changes in their attitude toward use of the Internet, our subscriber acquisition and retention and operating results may be affected adversely. Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership Our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over Netflix. Our executive officers and directors, their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds, as of March 12, 2003 beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 55% of our common stock. In particular, 33 Jay Hoag, one of our directors, beneficially owns approximately 34% of our common stock, and Reed Hastings, our president, chief executive officer, and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns approximately 13% of our common stock and Michael Schuh, one of our directors, beneficially owns approximately 12% of our common stock. These stockholders may have individual interests that are different from yours and will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. Our charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they will: authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; provide for a classified board of directors; prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. Our stock price is volatile The price at which our common stock has traded since our Initial Public Offering in May of 2002 has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control: variations in our operating results; variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community; announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; market volatility in general; and the operating results of our competitors. As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. This type of litigation, if directed at us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. 34 We will record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future. We are required to recognize, as a reduction of stockholders equity, deferred compensation equal to the difference between the fair market value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant. This deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options, generally three to four years, using the graded vesting method. At December 31, 2002, approximately $11.4 million of deferred compensation related to employee stock options remained unamortized. The resulting amortization expense will have a material negative impact on our operating results in future periods. In addition, in August and September 2001 we repriced options to purchase an aggregate of 913,795 shares of our common stock to $3.00 per share. We cannot predict the amount of compensation expense that we will have to recognize on a quarterly basis for these repriced options, and it could materially negatively impact our operating results for future periods. Financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our financial results will be difficult because of our limited operating history, and our actual results may differ from forecasts. As a result of our growth and our limited operating history, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenues, gross profit, operating expenses, number of paying subscribers, number of DVDs shipped per day and other financial and operating data. The inability by us or the financial community to accurately forecast our operating results could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected, which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We have a limited amount of meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses. We base our current and forecasted expense levels and DVD acquisitions on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues, which are dependent on the growth of our subscriber base and the demand for titles by our subscribers. As a result, we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts or to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls in revenues. We believe that these difficulties in forecasting are even greater for financial analysts that may publish their own estimates of our financial results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. To minimize this risk in the future, we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities. Our cash equivalents are generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. We intend to limit the percentage invested in short term investments to no more than fifty percent of the combined fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments. We also intend to limit the average duration on our short term investments to less than three years. As of December 31, 2002 all short term investments were invested in the Vanguard Short Term Bond Index Fund Admiral Shares (the Fund). The target index, for the Fund, the Lehman 1 5 Year Government/Credit Bond Index (the Index), is comprised of approximately 1,500 U.S. Treasury and agency securities and investment grade corporate bonds with maturities between 1 and 5 years. As of December 31, 2002 the Fund had investments in 363 issues with an average quality of Aa1/Aa2, an average duration of 2.4 years and an average yield, net of expenses, of 2.43%. As of December 31, 2002, the cost, unrealized gain and market value of our short term investments was $43,022,000, $774,000 and $43,796,000, respectively.
