Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our Business We are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the United States, providing approximately 7.5 million subscribers access to approximately 90,000 DVD titles plus a library of more than 6,000 choices that can be watched instantly on their PCs. We offer nine subscription plans, starting at $4.99 a month. There are no due dates, no late fees and no shipping fees. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service, receive them on DVD by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next available DVD in a subscribers queue. We also offer certain titles through our instant watching feature. The terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse. Our core strategy is to grow a large DVD subscription business and to expand into Internet based delivery of content as that market develops. We believe that the DVD format, along with its high definition successor formats, including Blu ray, will continue to be the main vehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large DVD subscription business, we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to Internet based delivery of content if it becomes the preferred consumer medium for accessing content. Key Business Metrics Management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies, allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business. The key business metrics include the following: Churn: Churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions, then divided by three months. Management reviews this metric to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans. Subscriber Acquisition Cost: Subscriber acquisition cost is defined as total marketing expense divided by total gross subscriber additions. Management reviews this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value. Gross Margin: Management reviews gross margin to monitor variable costs and operating efficiency. Management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric. Please see Results of Operations below for further discussion on these key business metrics. Performance Highlights The following represents our 2007 performance highlights: 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 1,205,340 $ 996,660 $ 682,213 Net income 66,952 49,082 42,027 Net income per share diluted $ 0.97 $ 0.71 $ 0.64 Total subscribers at end of period 7,479 6,316 4,179 Churn (annualized) 4.3 % 4.1 % 4.5 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 40.88 $ 42.96 $ 38.77 Gross margin 34.8 % 37.1 % 31.7 % 28 Table of Contents Recent Developments We believe that the DVD format, along with its high definition successor formats, including Blu ray, will continue to be the main vehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future. We introduced a new feature in January 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their PCs. We intend to broaden the distribution capability of this feature to multiple platforms over time, and, as a result, in January 2008 we announced a development arrangement with LG Electronics. While the terms of this arrangement have not been finalized, we anticipate developing, in conjunction with LG, a set top box device that will enable our instant watching feature to be viewed directly through subscribers televisions. In late 2006, Blockbuster launched its integrated store based and online program, Total Access, whereby Blockbuster online subscribers may return DVDs delivered to them from Blockbuster Online to Blockbuster stores in exchange for an in store rental. Total Access was aggressively priced and experienced rapid subscriber growth and large operating losses in the first half of 2007. In the second half of 2007, Blockbuster adopted a new competitive strategy which emphasized profitable growth. As part of this new strategy, Blockbuster reduced their marketing spending and raised prices on Total Access, which we believe contributed to an acceleration in our subscriber growth. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. Amortization of Content Library and Upfront Costs We acquire content from studios and distributors through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements or license agreements. We acquire content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues, and, as such, we consider our content library to be a productive asset, and classify our content library as a non current asset. Additionally, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, we classify cash outflows for the acquisition of the content library, net of changes in related accounts payable, as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. This is inclusive of any upfront non refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements. We amortize our DVDs, less estimated salvage value, on a sum of the months accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The useful life of the new release DVDs and back catalog DVDs is estimated to be 1 year and 3 years, respectively. In estimating the useful life of our DVDs, we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged DVDs. Volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are recorded as a reduction of DVD inventory when earned. For those direct purchase DVDs that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives, a salvage value of $3.00 per DVD has been provided. For those DVDs that we do not expect to sell, no salvage value is provided. We periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our DVDs. 29 Table of Contents Under revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors, we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or a fee based on utilization over a fixed period of time, or the Title Term, which is typically between 6 and 12 months for each title. At the end of the Title Term, we generally have the option of returning the DVD title to the studio, destroying the title or purchasing the title. In addition, we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements. This payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our content library amortization policy. In some cases, this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred. We amortize license fees on Internet based content on a straight line basis consistent with the terms of the license agreements. Stock Based Compensation We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123(R)) on January 1, 2006. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, (SFAS No 123) as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 in the second quarter of 2003, and restated prior periods at that time. Because the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. We changed our method of calculating the fair value of new stock based compensation awards under our stock plans from a Black Scholes model to a lattice binomial model on January 1, 2007. We continue to use a Black Scholes option model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares. The lattice binomial model has been applied prospectively to options granted subsequent to January 1, 2007. The lattice binomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Expected Volatility: Our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock. Our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. Suboptimal Exercise Factor: Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise behavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted, and is determined for both executives and non executives. We grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. We have elected to grant all options as non qualified stock options which vest immediately. As a result of immediate vesting, stock based compensation expense determined under SFAS No. 123(R) is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for post vesting option forfeitures. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the SFAS No. 123(R) disclosures. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2007, our deferred tax assets were $18.5 million. As of December 31, 2006, deferred tax assets did not include the tax benefits attributable to approximately $56 million of excess tax deductions related to stock options. In 2007, these benefits were realized as a reduction of taxes payable and credited to equity. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Descriptions of Consolidated Statements of Operations Components Revenues We generate all our revenues in the United States. We derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably over each subscribers monthly subscription period. We record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues. Cost of Revenues Subscription We acquire titles from studios and distributors through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements or license agreements. Direct purchases of DVDs normally result in higher upfront costs than titles obtained through revenue sharing agreements. Cost of subscription revenues consists of postage and packaging costs related to shipping titles to paying subscribers, amortization of our content library and revenue sharing expenses. Costs related to free trial subscribers are allocated to marketing expenses. Postage and Packaging. Postage and packaging expenses consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our paying subscribers and the packaging and label costs for the mailers. The rate for first class postage was $0.37 between June 29, 2002 and January 7, 2006. Between January 8, 2006 and May 13, 2007, the rate for first class postage was $0.39. The U.S. Postal Service increased the rate of first class postage by 2 cents to $0.41 effective May 14, 2007 and by one cent to $0.42 effective May 12, 2008. We receive discounts on outbound postage costs related to our mail preparation practices. Amortization of Content Library. The useful life of the new release DVDs and back catalog DVDs is estimated to be 1 year and 3 years, respectively. We provide a salvage value of $3.00 per DVD for those direct purchase DVDs that we estimate will sell at the end of their useful lives. For those DVDs that we do not expect to sell, no salvage value is provided. We amortize license fees on Internet based content on a straight line basis consistent with the terms of the license agreements. 31 Table of Contents Revenue Sharing Expenses. Our revenue sharing agreements generally commit us to pay an initial upfront fee for content acquired and either a percentage of revenue earned from such rentals for a defined period of time or to pay a fee based on utilization. A portion of the initial upfront fees are non recoupable for revenue sharing purposes and are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our content library amortization policy. The remaining portion of the initial upfront fee represents prepaid revenue sharing, and this amount is expensed as revenue sharing expense as content subject to revenue sharing agreements is shipped to or watched by subscribers. The terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles. We amortize minimum revenue sharing prepayments (or accrete an amount payable to studios if the payment is due in arrears) as revenue sharing obligations are incurred. A provision for estimated shortfall, if any, on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, the terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios provide for rebates based on achieving specified performance levels. Volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are accrued when earned based on historical title performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term. Fulfillment expenses Fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing our content library. Fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees. Operating Expenses Technology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in testing, maintaining and modifying our Web site, our recommendation service, developing solutions for the Internet based delivery of content to subscribers, telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internal use software systems. Technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our Web site and store our data. Marketing. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses. Advertising expenses include marketing program expenditures and other promotional activities, including revenue sharing expenses, postage and packaging expenses and content amortization related to free trial periods. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for marketing personnel. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance, content acquisition and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. Stock Based Compensation. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method. We had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 and restated prior periods at that time. We grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. We have elected to grant all options as non qualified stock options which vest immediately. As a result of immediate vesting, stock based compensation expense determined under SFAS No. 123(R) is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post vesting option forfeitures. Gain on disposal of DVDs. Gain on disposal of DVDs represents the difference between proceeds from sales of DVDs and associated cost of DVD sales. Cost of DVD sales includes the net book value of the DVDs sold, shipping charges and, where applicable, a contractually specified fee for the DVDs that are subject to revenue sharing agreements. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues: Subscription 55.1 53.4 57.7 Fulfillment expenses 10.1 9.5 10.6 Total cost of revenues 65.2 62.9 68.3 Gross profit 34.8 37.1 31.7 Operating expenses: Technology and development 5.9 4.9 5.2 Marketing 18.1 22.6 21.2 General and administrative 4.4 3.6 5.2 Gain on disposal of DVDs (0.6 ) (0.5 ) (0.3 ) Gain on legal settlement (0.6 ) Total operating expenses 27.2 30.6 31.3 Operating income 7.6 6.5 0.4 Other income (expense): Interest and other income (expense) 1.7 1.6 0.8 Income before income taxes 9.3 8.1 1.2 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 3.7 3.2 (5.0 ) Net income 5.6 % 4.9 % 6.2 % Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber) Revenues $ 1,205,340 $ 996,660 $ 682,213 Percentage change over prior period 20.9 % 46.1 % Other data: Average number of paying subscribers 6,718 5,083 3,169 Percentage change over prior period 32.2 % 60.4 % Average monthly revenue per paying subscriber $ 14.95 $ 16.34 $ 17.94 Percentage change over prior period (8.5 )% (8.9 )% We currently generate all of our revenues in the United States. We derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscribers monthly subscription period. The increase in our revenues in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily a result of the substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online 33 Table of Contents DVD rentals. This increase was offset in part by a decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower cost subscription plans, as well as a price reduction for our most popular subscription plans during the second quarter of 2007. We expect the average revenue per paying subscriber to continue to decline until the mix of new subscribers and existing subscribers is approximately equivalent by subscription plan price point. The increase in our revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily a result of the substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers offset in part by a decline in average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber. We believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven primarily by increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online DVD rentals and continuing improvements in our service. The decline in the average monthly revenue per paying subscriber was a result of the continued popularity of our lower cost subscription plans. Churn was 4.3% as of December 31, 2007 and remained relatively flat as compared to 2006 and 2005. The following table presents our ending subscriber information: As of December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Free subscribers 153 162 153 As a percentage of total subscribers 2.0 % 2.6 % 3.7 % Paid subscribers 7,326 6,154 4,026 As a percentage of total subscribers 98.0 % 97.4 % 96.3 % Total subscribers 7,479 6,316 4,179 Percentage change over prior period 18.4 % 51.1 % Cost of Revenues Subscription Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Subscription $ 664,407 $ 532,621 $ 393,788 As a percentage of revenues 55.1 % 53.4 % 57.7 % Percentage change over prior period 24.7 % 35.3 % The increase in cost of subscription revenues in absolute dollars for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the following factors: The number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers increased 20%. This was driven by a 32% increase in the number of average paying subscribers, partially offset by a decline in monthly movie rentals per average paying subscriber attributed to the continued growth of our lower priced plans. Postage and packaging expenses increased by 24%. This was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers, as well as an increase in the rate of first class postage of 2 cents in May 2007. Content amortization increased by 39% primarily due to increased acquisitions of our content library, while revenue sharing expenses remained flat. In addition, costs related to our instant watching feature have been included in cost of subscription revenues since its introduction in January 2007. 34 Table of Contents The increase in cost of subscription revenues in absolute dollars for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the following factors: The number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers increased 42%. This was driven by a 60% increase in the number of average paying subscribers offset by a slight decline in monthly movie rentals per average paying subscriber attributed to the increased popularity of our lower priced plans. Postage and packaging expenses increased by 48%. This was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers, as well as the first class postage rate increase of 2 cents that was effective January 8, 2006. DVD amortization increased by 47% primarily due to increased acquisitions for our DVD library. Revenue sharing expenses increased by 10%. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of average paying subscribers offset by a decrease in the percentage of DVDs subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to paying subscribers. Fulfillment Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Fulfillment expenses $ 121,761 $ 94,364 $ 71,987 As a percentage of revenues 10.1 % 9.5 % 10.6 % Percentage change over prior period 29.0 % 31.1 % The increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers, coupled with higher credit card fees as a result of 32% growth in the average number of paying subscribers. In addition, the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facility related costs resulting from the expansion of our customer service center, the expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones. The increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers, coupled with higher credit card fees as a result of 60% growth in the average number of paying subscribers. In addition, the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facility related costs resulting from the expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones. We anticipate that fulfillment expenses will increase in 2008 due to higher volume of shipped discs and continued expansion of our network of distribution centers. Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross profit $ 419,172 $ 369,675 $ 216,438 Gross margin 34.8 % 37.1 % 31.7 % The decrease in gross margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in postage rates effective May 2007 and a reduction in the prices of our most popular subscription plans during the second quarter of 2007. In addition, costs related to our instant watching feature have been included in cost of subscriptions beginning January 2007. 35 Table of Contents The increase in gross margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in revenue sharing cost per paid shipment, which includes a decline in the percentage of DVDs subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to paying subscribers, as well as an increase in revenue per paid shipment as a result of a decline in overall usage and the continued popularity of our lower priced plans. The increase in postage rates by 2 cents effective January 8, 2006 negatively impacted gross margin, however, this impact was offset by a decline in fulfillment costs as a result of increased operational efficiencies. We anticipate that gross margin will decline in 2008, due to the impact of lower prices coupled with the postage rate increase of one cent, which is effective May 2008. Operating Expenses Technology and Development Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Technology and development $ 71,395 $ 48,379 $ 35,388 As a percentage of revenues 5.9 % 4.9 % 5.2 % Percentage change over prior period 47.6 % 36.7 % The increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily the result of an increase in personnel related costs due to growth in headcount and expenses related to the development of solutions for the Internet based delivery of content. The increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of an increase in personnel and facility related costs, as well as expenses related to the development of solutions for the Internet based delivery of content. We continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers experience. Additionally, we continue to develop and enhance solutions for the Internet based delivery of content to our subscribers. As a result, we expect our technology and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in 2008. Marketing Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages andsubscriber acquisition cost) Marketing $ 218,280 $ 225,524 $ 144,562 As a percentage of revenues 18.1 % 22.6 % 21.2 % Percentage change over prior period (3.2 )% 56.0 % Other data: Gross subscriber additions 5,340 5,250 3,729 Percentage change over prior period 1.7 % 40.8 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 40.88 $ 42.96 $ 38.77 Percentage change over prior period (4.8 )% 10.8 % The decrease in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing program costs, principally in television advertising and direct mail. In the second half of 2007, we lowered prices on our most popular subscription plans and decided to partially offset the 36 Table of Contents cost of our investment in lower prices by reducing our spending on marketing programs. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to a mix of lower prices and more efficient marketing spending. The increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing program costs, which included direct mail, online advertising and television advertising, to attract new subscribers. Subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in marketing program spending offset in part by a decrease in cost of providing free trials associated with our lower priced plans coupled with a slight decline in personnel related costs. We anticipate that our marketing expense will decrease in absolute dollars in 2008 due to more efficient use of our marketing dollars. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 52,532 $ 36,155 $ 35,486 As a percentage of revenues 4.4 % 3.6 % 5.2 % Percentage change over prior period 45.3 % 1.9 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs due to growth in headcount. The increase was also attributable to higher costs related to legal proceedings. The increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to ongoing legal proceedings, personnel costs and professional fees to support our growing operations. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2008 in order to support our growing operations. Gain on Disposal of DVDs Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Gain on disposal of DVDs $ (7,196 ) $ (4,797 ) $ (1,987 ) As a percentage of revenues (0.6 )% (0.5 )% (0.3 )% Percentage change over prior period 50.0 % 141.4 % The increase in gain on disposal of DVDs in absolute dollars in 2007 and 2006 as compared to 2006 and 2005, respectively, was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of DVDs sold, offset in part by an increase in the cost of DVD sales. Gain on Legal Settlement On June 25, 2007, we resolved a pending patent litigation with Blockbuster, Inc. As part of the settlement, we received a one time payment of $7.0 million during the second quarter of 2007. 37 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income (expense) $ 20,340 $ 15,904 $ 5,346 As a percentage of revenues 1.7 % 1.6 % 0.8 % Percentage change over prior period 27.9 % 197.5 % The increase in interest and other income in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily a result of our newly invested short term investment portfolio which was higher yielding than our money market funds. Interest and other income (expense) consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and short term investments. Interest and dividend income was approximately $19.7 million, $15.9 million and $5.8 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest and other income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents due to increased interest rates as well as higher average cash balances resulting from a net increase in cash flows and net proceeds of $101.1 million from the secondary public offering of our common stock in May 2006. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 44,549 $ 31,236 $ (33,692 ) Effective tax rate 40.0 % 38.9 % (404.2 )% In 2007 and 2006, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes. In 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of $33.7 million on pretax income of $8.3 million. Our 2005 income tax benefit includes a tax benefit for the reduction in the valuation allowance of $34.9 million. In 2005 we reduced the valuation allowance after determining that substantially all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable due to expected future income. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001. Many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including, but not limited to, the number of subscribers who sign up for our service, the growth or reduction in our subscriber base and our ability to develop new revenue sources. In addition, we may have to or otherwise choose to lower our prices and increase our marketing expenses in order to grow faster or respond to competition. Although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require or choose to obtain additional financing. Our ability to obtain financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations, which consists primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items such as amortization of our content library and the depreciation of property and equipment. Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition of content, marketing and fulfillment expenses. In 2008, operating cash flows will be a significant source of liquidity, while the acquisition of content, marketing and fulfillment expenses will continue to be significant uses of cash. In addition, on January 31, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of 38 Table of Contents our common stock through the end of 2008. We completed this stock repurchase program in February 2008. The following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 177,439 $ 400,430 $ 212,256 Short term investments 207,703 $ 385,142 $ 400,430 $ 212,256 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 291,823 $ 247,862 $ 157,507 Net cash used in investing activities $ (450,813 ) $ (185,869 ) $ (133,248 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (64,001 ) $ 126,181 $ 13,314 Operating Activities Our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $67.0 million, increased by non cash adjustments of $194.8 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $30.0 million during 2007. The majority of the non cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $203.4 million which increased by $62.3 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles, including Internet delivered content in 2007, in order to support our larger subscriber base. Cash provided by operating activities increased $44.0 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. This was primarily due to an increase in net income of $17.9 million, increased non cash adjustments of $31.2 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $5.1 million. Our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $49.1 million, increased by non cash adjustments of $163.7 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $35.1 million during 2006. The majority of the non cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $141.2 million, which increased $44.3 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base. Cash provided by operating activities increased $90.4 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to higher net income of $7.1 million, non cash adjustments of $80.8 million and net changes in assets and liabilities of $2.5 million. Investing Activities Our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of available for sale securities, acquisitions of content library, including Internet delivered content in 2007, and purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities increased $264.9 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we started an investment portfolio which is comprised of short term investments consisting of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset and mortgage backed securities. The majority of the portfolio is invested in AAA rated residential and commercial mortgage backed securities. The mortgage bonds owned represent the senior tranches of the capital structure and provide credit enhancement through over collateralization and their subordinated characteristics. We continue to purchase additional titles, including Internet delivered content in 2007, for our content library in order to support our larger subscriber base. Content acquisitions were $53.9 million higher in 2007 as compared to 2006. Purchases of property and equipment consisted of expenditures related to Company expansion, primarily to our headquarters in Los Gatos, California. In March 2006, we exercised our option to lease a building adjacent to our headquarters in Los Gatos, California. The building will comprise approximately 80,000 square feet of office space and have an initial term of 5 years. The building is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, purchases of property and equipment consisted of automation equipment for our various shipping centers in order to achieve increased operational efficiencies. 39 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities increased $52.6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Investing activities primarily consisted of additional titles being purchased for our content library in order to support our larger subscriber base and purchases of property and equipment in order to support our growing operations. Content acquisitions were $58.1 million higher in 2006 as compared to 2005 while purchases of property and equipment were flat. Financing Activities Our financing activities consisted primarily of issuance of common stock, repurchases of our common stock and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation. Cash provided by financing activities decreased by $190.2 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to stock repurchases of $99.9 million in 2007 and a decrease of $103.4 million in issuances of common stock as we had raised $101.1 million in a secondary offering in 2006. On April 18, 2007, we announced a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our common stock through the end of 2007. As of November 2007, we completed our stock repurchase program. We did not have any stock repurchases during 2006. This use of cash was offset by the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $26.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities increased $112.9 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the proceeds of $101.1 million from the secondary public offering of our common stock in May 2006, as well as $13.2 million of tax benefits from stock based compensation. Contractual Obligations For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2007. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual obligations (in thousands): Total Less than1 year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 years Operating lease obligations $ 54,229 $ 15,133 $ 24,232 $ 14,167 $ 697 Other purchase obligations (1) 68,702 49,820 16,132 2,750 Total $ 122,931 $ 64,953 $ 40,364 $ 16,917 $ 697 (1) Other purchase obligations relate primarily to acquisitions for our content library. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. License Agreements In addition to the above contractual obligations, we have certain license agreements with studios that include a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future. Access to these titles is based on the discretion of the studios and, as such, we may not receive these titles. If we did receive access to the maximum number of titles, we would incur up to an additional $25.5 million in commitments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off balance sheet risks. 40 Table of Contents Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow us to challenge the other partys claim. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by it under these agreements. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141 R, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141 R), to replace SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 R requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer, establishes the acquisition date and broadens the scope to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The statement requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 also amends certain provisions of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, although earlier adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards which permit, or in some cases require, estimates of fair market value. SFAS No. 157 was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year. In December 2007, the FASB issued proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 b (FSP No. 157 b), which would delay the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. FSP No. 157 b partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP No. 157 b. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Specifically, the pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on the related derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, 41 Table of Contents disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions. The interpretation was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. To minimize this risk, we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities. At December 31, 2007, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset and mortgage backed securities. The majority of the portfolio is invested in AAA rated residential and commercial mortgage backed securities. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis point) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair market value of our short term investments of approximately $3.5 million.
