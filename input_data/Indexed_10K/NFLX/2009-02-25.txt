Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our Business With more than 10 million subscribers, we are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the United States. We offer a variety of subscription plans, with no due dates, no late fees, no shipping fees and no pay per view fees. We provide subscribers access to over 100,000 DVD and Blu ray titles plus more than 12,000 streaming content choices. Subscribers select titles at our Web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service and merchandising tools. Subscribers can: Receive DVDs by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next available DVD in a subscribers queue. Watch streaming content without commercial interruption on personal computers (PCs), Intel based Macintosh computers (Macs) and televisions (TVs). The viewing experience is enabled by Netflix controlled software that can run on a variety of devices. These devices include PCs, Macs, Internet connected Blu ray players, such as those manufactured by LG Electronics and Samsung, set top boxes, such as TiVo and the Netflix Player by Roku, game consoles, such as Microsofts Xbox 360, and planned for later this year, TVs from Vizio and LG Electronics. Our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of DVD by mail and streaming content. We offer over 100,000 titles on DVD. In comparison, the 12,000 content choices available for streaming are relatively limited. We expect to substantially broaden the content choices as more content becomes available to us. Until such time, by bundling DVD and streaming as part of the Netflix subscription, we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price. We believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service. This advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the Internet from competing services, by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand, distribution, and our proprietary merchandising platform. Despite the growing popularity of Internet delivered content, we expect that DVD will continue to be the primary means by which most Netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future. However, at some point in the future, we expect that Internet delivery of content directly to the home will surpass DVD. Key Business Metrics Management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies, allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business. The key business metrics include the following: Churn: Churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions, then divided by three months. Management reviews this metric to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans. Subscriber Acquisition Cost: Subscriber acquisition cost is defined as total marketing expense divided by total gross subscriber additions. Management reviews this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value. Gross Margin: Management reviews gross margin to monitor variable costs and operating efficiency. Management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric. Please see Results of Operations below for further discussion on these key business metrics. 26 Table of Contents Performance Highlights The following represents our performance highlights for 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands, except for per share amounts, percentages and subscriber acquisition costs): 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 1,364,661 $ 1,205,340 $ 996,660 Net income 83,026 66,608 48,839 Net income per share diluted $ 1.32 $ 0.97 $ 0.71 Total subscribers at end of period 9,390 7,479 6,316 Churn (annualized) (1) 4.2 % 4.3 % 4.1 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 29.12 $ 40.86 $ 42.94 Gross margin 33.3 % 34.8 % 37.1 % (1) Churn (annualized) is the average of Churn for the four quarters of each respective year Recent Developments We continue to broaden the content available for streaming including recent additions of content from CBS, Disney, Sony and Starz Play. We have also announced several partnerships with technology and consumer electronics companies that enable our subscribers to watch streaming content without commercial interruption. These partners include Roku, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Samsung, TiVo and Vizio. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Content Accounting We obtain content from studios and distributors through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements or license agreements. We acquire DVD content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues, and, as such, we consider our DVD library to be a productive asset. Accordingly, we classify our DVD library as a non current asset on our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, (SFAS 95) cash outflows for the acquisition of the DVD library, net of changes in related accounts payable, are classified as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. This is inclusive of any upfront non refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements. We amortize our DVDs, less estimated salvage value, on a sum of the months accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The useful life of the new release DVDs and back catalog DVDs is estimated to be one year and three years, respectively. In estimating the useful life of our DVDs, we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged DVDs. 27 Table of Contents For those direct purchase DVDs that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives, a salvage value of $3.00 per DVD has been provided. For those DVDs that we do not expect to sell, no salvage value is provided. We periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our DVDs. We also obtain content distribution rights in order to stream movies and TV episodes without commercial interruption to subscribers. We account for streaming content in accordance with SFAS No. 63, Reporting by Broadcasters (SFAS 63), which requires classification of streaming content as either a current or non current asset in the consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated time of usage after certain criteria have been met, including availability of the streaming content for its first showing. We amortize our streaming content on a straight line basis generally over the term of the related license agreements or the titles window of availability. Cash outflows associated with the streaming content are classified as cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. We also obtain DVD and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors. We generally obtain titles for low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or a fee, based on utilization, over a fixed period, or the Title Term, which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title. The initial cost may be in the form of an upfront non refundable payment. This payment is capitalized in the content library in accordance with our DVD and streaming content policies as applicable. The initial cost may also be in the form of a prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense. The terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles. We amortize minimum revenue sharing prepayments (or accrete an amount payable to studios if the payment is due in arrears) as revenue sharing obligations are incurred. A provision for estimated shortfall, if any, on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Under the revenue sharing agreements for our DVD library, at the end of the Title Term, we generally have the option of returning the DVD to the studio, destroying the DVD or purchasing the DVD. Additionally, the terms of certain DVD direct purchase agreements with studios provide for volume purchase discounts or rebates based on achieving specified performance levels. Volume purchase discounts are recorded as a reduction of DVD library when earned. We accrue for rebates as earned based on historical title performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term. Stock Based Compensation We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), on January 1, 2006. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We changed our method of calculating the fair value of new stock based compensation awards under our stock plans from a Black Scholes model to a lattice binomial model on January 1, 2007. We continue to use a Black Scholes option model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares. The lattice binomial model has been applied prospectively to options granted subsequent to January 1, 2007. The lattice binomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Expected Volatility: Our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock. Our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. 28 Table of Contents Suboptimal Exercise Factor: Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise behavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted, and is determined for both executives and non executives. We grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. We have elected to grant all options as non qualified stock options which vest immediately. As a result of immediate vesting, stock based compensation expense determined under SFAS No. 123(R) is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for post vesting option forfeitures. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding SFAS No. 123(R). Income Taxes We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying the enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. As of December 31, 2008, our deferred tax asset balance was $28.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, our deferred tax asset balance was $19.1 million. There was no valuation allowance as of December 31, 2008 or 2007. During 2007, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Boards (FASB) Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 changes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a new framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present and disclose uncertain tax positions in their financial statements. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Descriptions of Consolidated Statements of Operations Components Revenues We derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably over each subscribers monthly subscription period. We record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues. We generate all our revenues in the United States. 29 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues Subscription Cost of subscription revenues consists of postage and packaging costs related to shipping DVDs to subscribers as well as content related expenses. Costs related to free trial periods are allocated to marketing expenses. Postage and Packaging. Postage and packaging expenses consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our paying subscribers and the packaging and label costs for the mailers. Between January 8, 2006 and May 13, 2007, the rate for first class postage was $0.39. The U.S. Postal Service increased the rate of first class postage by 2 cents to $0.41 effective May 14, 2007 and by one cent to $0.42 effective May 12, 2008. We receive discounts on outbound postage costs related to our mail preparation practices. Content Expenses. We obtain titles from studios and distributors through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements or license agreements. Direct purchases of DVDs normally result in higher upfront costs than titles obtained through revenue sharing agreements. Content related expenses consist of costs incurred in obtaining titles such as amortization of content and revenue sharing expense. Fulfillment expenses Fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing our content library. Fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees. Operating Expenses Technology and Development. Technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in testing, maintaining and modifying our Web site, our recommendation service, developing solutions for streaming content to subscribers, telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internal use software systems. Technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our Web site and store our data. Marketing. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses. Advertising expenses include marketing program expenditures and other promotional activities, including allocated costs of revenues relating to free trial periods Also included in marketing expense are payments made to our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service as well as payroll related expenses. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance, content acquisition and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. Stock Based Compensation. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method. We grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. We have elected to grant all options as non qualified stock options which vest immediately. As a result of immediate vesting, stock based compensation expense determined under SFAS No. 123(R) is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post vesting option forfeitures. Gain on disposal of DVDs. Gain on disposal of DVDs represents the difference between proceeds from sales of DVDs and associated cost of DVD sales. Cost of DVD sales includes the net book value of the DVDs sold, shipping charges and, where applicable, a contractually specified fee for the DVDs that are subject to revenue sharing agreements. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs of revenues: Subscription 55.8 55.1 53.4 Fulfillment expenses 10.9 10.1 9.5 Total cost of revenues 66.7 65.2 62.9 Gross profit 33.3 34.8 37.1 Operating expenses: Technology and development 6.6 5.9 4.8 Marketing 14.6 18.1 22.6 General and administrative 3.6 4.3 3.6 Gain on disposal of DVDs (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.5 ) Gain on legal settlement (0.6 ) Total operating expenses 24.4 27.2 30.5 Operating income 8.9 7.6 6.6 Other income (expense): Interest expense on lease financing obligations (0.2 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Interest and other income (expense) 0.9 1.7 1.5 Income before income taxes 9.6 9.2 8.0 Provision for income taxes 3.5 3.7 3.1 Net income 6.1 % 5.5 % 4.9 % Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthlysubscription revenue pre paying subscriber) Revenues $ 1,364,661 $ 1,205,340 $ 996,660 Percentage change over prior period 13.2 % 20.9 % Other data: Average number of paying subscribers 8,268 6,718 5,083 Percentage change over prior period 23.1 % 32.2 % Average monthly revenue per paying subscriber $ 13.75 $ 14.95 $ 16.34 Percentage change over prior period (8.0 )% (8.5 )% The increase in our revenues in 2008 as compared to 2007, and 2007 as compared to 2006, was primarily a result of the substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online movie and TV episode rentals and other aspects of our service. This increase was offset in part by a decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower cost subscription plans, as well as a price reduction for our most popular subscription plans during the third quarter of 2007. We expect the average revenue per paying subscriber to continue to decline until the mix of new subscribers and existing subscribers is approximately equivalent by subscription plan price point. 31 Table of Contents The following table presents our ending subscriber information: As of December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Free subscribers 226 153 162 As a percentage of total subscribers 2.4 % 2.0 % 2.6 % Paid subscribers 9,164 7,326 6,154 As a percentage of total subscribers 97.6 % 98.0 % 97.4 % Total subscribers 9,390 7,479 6,316 Percentage change over prior period 25.6 % 18.4 % Cost of Revenues Subscription Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Subscription $ 761,133 $ 664,407 $ 532,621 As a percentage of revenues 55.8 % 55.1 % 53.4 % Percentage change over prior period 14.6 % 24.7 % The increase in cost of subscription revenues in absolute dollars for 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to the following factors: The number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers increased 19%. This was driven by a 23% increase in the number of average paying subscribers, partially offset by a decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber attributed to the continued growth of our lower priced plans. Postage and packaging expenses increased by 23%. This was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers and increases in the rates of first class postage in May 2007 and May 2008. Content expenses increased by 7%. This increase was primarily attributable to the increased investments in streaming content in 2008, as well as an increase in DVD revenue sharing costs. The increase in cost of subscription revenues in absolute dollars for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the following factors: The number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers increased 20%. This was driven by a 32% increase in the number of average paying subscribers, partially offset by a decline in monthly movie rentals per average paying subscriber attributed to the continued growth of our lower priced plans. Postage and packaging expenses increased by 24%. This was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers, as well as an increase in the rate of first class postage of 2 cents in May 2007. Content expenses increased by 26%. This increase was primarily attributable to the increased acquisition of DVD library with the remaining increase attributable to the investment in streaming content as we introduced Internet delivery of content in January 2007. 32 Table of Contents Fulfillment Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Fulfillment expenses $ 149,101 $ 121,761 $ 94,364 As a percentage of revenues 10.9 % 10.1 % 9.5 % Percentage change over prior period 22.5 % 29.0 % The increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2008 as compared to 2007, and 2007 as compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our shipping centers and customer service location, coupled with higher credit card fees as a result of the growth in the average number of paying subscribers. In addition, the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facility related costs resulting from the addition of new shipping centers, and for 2007, the expansion of our customer service center. Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross profit $ 454,427 $ 419,172 $ 369,675 Gross margin 33.3 % 34.8 % 37.1 % The decrease in gross margin in 2008 as compared to 2007, and 2007 as compared to 2006, was primarily due to an increase in postage rates effective May 2008 and 2007 and a reduction in the prices of our most popular subscription plans during the second half of 2007. In addition, costs related to our streaming content have been included in cost of subscriptions beginning January 2007. We anticipate that gross margin will decline in 2009, due to increased investment in content library coupled with an expected increase in postage rates effective May 2009. Operating Expenses Technology and Development Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Technology and development $ 89,873 $ 70,979 $ 47,831 As a percentage of revenues 6.6 % 5.9 % 4.8 % Percentage change over prior period 26.6 % 48.4 % The increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in personnel related costs due to growth in headcount and expenses related to the development of solutions for streaming content and continued improvements to our service. The increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily the result of an increase in personnel related costs due to growth in headcount and expenses related to the development of solutions for streaming content. 33 Table of Contents Marketing Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages andsubscriber acquisition cost) Marketing $ 199,713 $ 218,212 $ 225,436 As a percentage of revenues 14.6 % 18.1 % 22.6 % Percentage change over prior period (8.5 )% (3.2 )% Other data: Gross subscriber additions 6,859 5,340 5,250 Percentage change over prior period 28.4 % 1.7 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 29.12 $ 40.86 $ 42.94 Percentage change over prior period (28.7 )% (4.8 )% The decrease in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing program spending, principally in direct mail and inserts. In the second half of 2007, we lowered prices on our most popular subscription plans and decided to partially offset the cost of our investment in lower prices by reducing our spending on marketing programs. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to more efficient marketing spending. The decrease in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing program spending, principally in television advertising and direct mail. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to more efficient marketing spending. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 49,662 $ 52,404 $ 35,987 As a percentage of revenues 3.6 % 4.3 % 3.6 % Percentage change over prior period (5.2 )% 45.6 % The decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to a decrease in costs related to our subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, as well as a decrease in costs related to legal proceedings. These decreases were offset by an increase in personnel related costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs due to growth in headcount. The increase was also attributable to higher costs related to legal proceedings. Gain on Disposal of DVDs Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Gain on disposal of DVDs $ (6,327 ) $ (7,196 ) $ (4,797 ) As a percentage of revenues (0.4 )% (0.5 )% (0.5 )% Percentage change over prior period (12.1 )% 50.0 % The decrease in gain on disposal of DVDs in absolute dollars in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the sales price of DVDs. 34 Table of Contents The increase in gain on disposal of DVDs in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of DVDs sold, offset in part by an increase in the cost of DVD sales. In the first quarter of 2009, we discontinued retail sales of previously viewed DVDs to subscribers. However, we will continue to sell previously viewed DVDs through wholesale channels. Gain on Legal Settlement On June 25, 2007, we resolved a pending patent litigation with Blockbuster, Inc. As part of the settlement, we received a one time payment of $7.0 million during the second quarter of 2007. Interest Expense on Lease Financing Obligations Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest expense on lease financing obligations $ 2,458 $ 1,188 $ 1,210 As a percentage of revenues 0.2 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Percentage change over prior period 106.9 % (1.8 )% In June 2004 and June 2006, we entered into two separate lease arrangements whereby we leased a building that was constructed by a third party. As discussed in Note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements, we have accounted for these leases in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 97 10, The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction (EITF 97 10), and SFAS No. 98, Accounting for Leases: Sale Leaseback Transactions Involving Real Estate, Sales Type Leases of Real Estate, Definition of the Lease Term, and Initial Direct Costs of Direct Financing Leases; an amendment of FASB Statements No. 13, 66, and 91 and a rescission of FASB Statement No. 26 and Technical Bulletin No. 79 11 (SFAS 98), which causes Netflix to be considered the owner (for accounting purposes) of the two buildings. Accordingly, we have recorded assets on our balance sheet for the costs paid by our lessor to construct our headquarters facilities, along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessor paid construction costs. The monthly rent payments we make to our lessor under our lease agreements are recorded in our financial statements as land lease expense and principal and interest on the financing liabilities. Interest expense on lease financing obligations reflects the portion of our monthly lease payments that is allocated to interest expense. Interest and Other Income (Expense) Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income, net $ 12,452 $ 20,340 $ 15,904 As a percentage of revenues 0.9 % 1.7 % 1.5 % Percentage change over prior period (38.8 )% 27.9 % The decrease in interest and other income in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily a result of the lower cash balance resulting from the repurchase of our common stock. Interest and other income (expense) consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and short term investments. Interest and dividend income was approximately $9 million, $20 million and $16 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, in 2008 interest and other income included approximately $3 million gain on the sale of short term investments. 35 Table of Contents The increase in interest and other income in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily a result of our newly invested short term investment portfolio which was higher yielding than our money market funds, and higher average cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 48,474 $ 44,317 $ 31,073 Effective tax rate 36.9 % 40.0 % 38.9 % In 2008, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes of $5 million or 4% of income before income tax. This was partially offset by R&D tax credits of $3 million. In 2007 and 2006, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001. Many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including, but not limited to, the number of subscribers who sign up for our service and the growth or reduction in our subscriber base. In addition, we may have to or otherwise choose to lower our prices and increase our marketing expenses in order to grow faster or respond to competition. Although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require or choose to obtain additional financing. Our ability to obtain financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations, which consists primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items such as amortization of our content library, depreciation of property and equipment and stock based compensation related to the issuance of common stock. Our primary uses of cash include our stock repurchase programs, shipping and packaging expenses, the acquisition of content, capital expenditures related to IT and automation equipment for operations, marketing and fulfillment expenses. In 2009, operating cash flows will be a significant source of liquidity, while the shipping and packaging expenses, acquisition of content, marketing and fulfillment expenses will continue to be significant uses of cash. In addition, on January 26, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase our common stock through the end of 2009. Based on the Boards authorization, the Company anticipates a repurchase program of up to $175 million in 2009. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. The following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 139,881 $ 177,439 $ 400,430 Short term investments 157,390 207,703 $ 297,271 $ 385,142 $ 400,430 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 284,037 $ 277,424 $ 248,190 Net cash used in investing activities $ (144,960 ) $ (436,024 ) $ (185,869 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (176,635 ) $ (64,391 ) $ 125,853 36 Table of Contents Operating Activities During 2008, our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $83.0 million, increased by non cash adjustments of $225.1 million offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $24.1 million. The majority of the non cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $209.8 million which increased by $6.3 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base. The decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content library related to our streaming content, as we continued to increase our investments in streaming content in 2008. Cash provided by operating activities increased $6.6 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. This was primarily due to an increase in net income of $16.4 million, increased non cash adjustments of $29.8 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $39.6 million. During 2007, our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $66.6 million, increased by non cash adjustments of $195.3 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $15.5 million. The majority of the non cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $203.4 million which increased by $62.3 million over the prior period as we continued to purchase additional titles, including streaming content in 2007, in order to support our larger subscriber base. Cash provided by operating activities increased $29.2 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. This was primarily due to an increase in net income of $17.8 million, increased non cash adjustments of $31.1 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $19.7 million. See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to reclassifications in cash flows in 2007. Investing Activities Our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of available for sale securities, acquisitions of content library related to DVDs and purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities decreased $291.1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the purchases of short term investments of $148.4 million coupled with an increase in the proceeds from the sale of short term investments of $106.5 million. In addition, content acquisitions related to acquisitions of DVDs decreased by $45.8 million as more DVDs were obtained through revenue sharing agreements in 2008. Cash used in investing activities increased $250.2 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we started an investment portfolio which is comprised of short term investments consisting of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset and mortgage backed securities. Content acquisitions were $39.1 million higher in 2007 as compared to 2006. Purchases of property and equipment consisted of expenditures related to Company expansion, primarily to our headquarters in Los Gatos, California. In March 2006, we exercised our option to lease a building adjacent to our headquarters in Los Gatos, California. The building comprises approximately 80,000 square feet of office space and has an initial term of 5 years. The building was completed in the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, purchases of property and equipment consisted of automation equipment for our various shipping centers in order to achieve increased operational efficiencies. Financing Activities Our financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of our common stock, issuance of common stock, and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation. Cash used by financing activities increased by $112.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in stock repurchases of $100.0 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation decreased by $21.0 million in 2008, as the Company utilized the remaining benefits from its net operating losses. This use of cash was offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of $9.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities decreased by $190.2 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to stock repurchases of $99.9 million in 2007 and a decrease of $103.4 million in issuances of common stock as we had raised $101.1 million in a secondary offering in 2006. We did not have any stock repurchases during 2006. This use of cash was offset by the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $26.2 million. 37 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2008. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual obligations (in thousands): Total Less than1 year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 years Operating lease obligations $ 30,398 $ 11,137 $ 13,150 $ 4,672 $ 1,439 Lease financing obligations 23,930 5,521 11,646 6,763 Other purchase obligations (1) 158,739 91,058 62,450 5,231 Total $ 213,067 $ 107,716 $ 87,246 $ 16,666 $ 1,439 (1) Other purchase obligations relate primarily to acquisitions for our content library. License Agreements In addition to the above contractual obligations, we have certain license agreements with studios that include a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future. Access to these titles is based on the discretion of the studios and, as such, we may not receive these titles. If we did receive access to the maximum number of titles, we would incur up to an additional $14.6 million in commitments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off balance sheet risks. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142 3). FSP 142 3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under FASB 38 Table of Contents Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142 3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141 R) and SFAS 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 5 (SFAS 160). SFAS 141 R requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer, establishes the acquisition date and broadens the scope to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. SFAS 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be re characterized as non controlling interests and classified as a component of equity. These statements are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards which permit, or in some cases require, estimates of fair market value. SFAS 157 was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157 2 (FSP 157 2), which would delay the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. FSP 157 2 partially defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP 157 2. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis. The partial adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 for non financial assets and non financial liabilities to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. As a result of current adverse financial market conditions, investments in some financial instruments, such as structured investment vehicles, sub prime mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, may pose risks arising from recent market liquidity and credit concerns. As of December 31, 2008, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short term investment portfolio relating to such adverse financial market conditions. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2008, our cash 39 Table of Contents equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset and mortgage backed securities. Approximately 60% of the portfolio is invested in government and agency issued securities. At December 31, 2008, we had securities classified as short term investments of $157.4 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. Due within one year $ 32,689 Due within five years 118,127 Due within ten years Due after ten years 6,574 Total $ 157,390 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2008. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. This methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values (in $ thousands) of our debt securities classified as short term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 31, 2008: Fair Value December 31, 2008 150 BPS 100 BPS 50 BPS +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS 160,283 159,319 158,354 156,426 155,462 154,497
