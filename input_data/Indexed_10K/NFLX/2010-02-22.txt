Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our Business With more than 12 million subscribers, we are the worlds largest subscription service streaming movies and TV episodes over the Internet and sending DVDs by mail. Our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited movies and TV episodes streamed to their TVs and computers and can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes. We offer a variety of subscription plans, with no due dates, no late fees, no shipping fees and no pay per view fees. Aided by our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology, subscribers can select from a growing library of titles that can be watched instantly and a vast array of titles on DVD. On average, approximately 2 million discs are shipped daily from our distribution centers across the United States. Additionally, more than 48% of our subscribers instantly watched more than 15 minutes of streaming content in the fourth quarter of 2009. Subscribers can: Watch streaming content without commercial interruption on their computers and TVs. The viewing experience is enabled by Netflix controlled software that can run on a variety of consumer electronics devices (Netflix Ready Devices). These Netflix Ready Devices currently include Blu ray disc players, Internet connected TVs, digital video players and game consoles. Receive DVDs by U.S. mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers. After a DVD has been returned, we mail the next available DVD in a subscribers queue. Our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of streaming and DVD bymail content. By combining streaming and DVD as part of the Netflix subscription, we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of movies for one low monthly price. We believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service. This advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the Internet from competing services, by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand, distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform. Despite the growing popularity of Internet delivered content, we expect that the standard definition DVD, along with its high definition successor, Blu ray (collectively referred to as DVD), will continue to be the primary means by which a majority of Netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future. However, at some point in the future, we expect that Internet delivery of content to the home will surpass DVD as the primary means by which most Netflix subscribers view content. 27 Table of Contents Performance Highlights The following represents our performance highlights for 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands, except for per share amounts, percentages and subscriber acquisition costs): 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 1,670,269 $ 1,364,661 $ 1,205,340 Net income 115,860 83,026 66,608 Net income per share diluted $ 1.98 $ 1.32 $ 0.97 Total subscribers at end of period 12,268 9,390 7,479 Churn (annualized) (1) 4.2 % 4.2 % 4.3 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 25.48 $ 29.12 $ 40.86 Gross margin 35.4 % 33.3 % 34.8 % (1) Churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber addition, then divided by three months. Churn (annualized) is the average of Churn for the four quarters of each respective year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Content Accounting We obtain content through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with studios, distributors, and other suppliers. DVD content is obtained through direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements. Streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement but may also be obtained through a revenue sharing agreement. We acquire DVD content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues, and, as such, we consider our direct purchase DVD library to be a productive asset. Accordingly, we classify our DVD library as a non current asset on our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, cash outflows for the acquisition of the DVD library, net of changes in related accounts payable, are classified as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. This is inclusive of any upfront non refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements. We amortize our direct purchase DVDs, less estimated salvage value, on a sum of the months accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The useful life of the new release DVDs and back catalog DVDs is estimated to be one year and three years, respectively. In estimating the useful life of our DVDs, we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged DVDs. For those direct purchase DVDs that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives, a salvage value is provided. For those DVDs that we do not expect to sell, no salvage value is provided. We periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our DVDs. 28 Table of Contents Additionally, the terms of certain DVD direct purchase agreements with studios and distributors provide for volume purchase discounts or rebates based on achieving specified performance levels. Volume purchase discounts are recorded as a reduction of DVD library when earned. We accrue for rebates as earned based on historical title performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term. We obtain content distribution rights in order to stream movies and TV episodes without commercial interruption to subscribers computers and TVs via Netflix Ready Devices. We account for streaming content in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) topic 920 Entertainment Broadcasters. Cash outflows associated with the streaming content are classified as cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. We classify our streaming content obtained through a license agreement as either a current or non current asset in the consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated time of usage after certain criteria have been met, including availability of the streaming content for its first showing. We amortize licensed streaming content on a straight line basis generally over the term of the related license agreements or the titles window of availability. We also obtain DVD and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors. We generally obtain titles for low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee, based on utilization, for a defined period of time, or the Title Term, which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title. The initial cost may be in the form of an upfront non refundable payment. This payment is capitalized in the content library in accordance with our DVD and streaming content policies as applicable. The initial cost may also be in the form of a prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense. The terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles. We amortize minimum revenue sharing prepayments (or accrete an amount payable to studios if the payment is due in arrears) as revenue sharing obligations are incurred. A provision for estimated shortfall, if any, on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Under the revenue sharing agreements for our DVD library, at the end of the Title Term, we generally have the option of returning the DVD to the studio, destroying the DVD or purchasing the DVD. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We calculate the fair value of new stock based compensation awards under our stock option plans using a lattice binomial model. We use a Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares. These models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Expected Volatility: Our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock. Our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. Suboptimal Exercise Factor: Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise behavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted and is determined for both executives and non executives. We grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. We have elected to grant all options as non qualified stock options which vest immediately. As a result of immediate vesting, stock based compensation 29 Table of Contents expense is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for post vesting option forfeitures. We also issue shares through our employee stock purchase program (ESPP) which has been determined to be compensatory in nature. Stock based compensation expense for shares issued under this program is expensed over the offering period of six months. Our stock based compensation expenses totaled $12.6 million, $12.3 million and $12.0 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result of changes in our compensation structure and related employee elections for 2010 resulting in an increase in the number of options granted to employees, we expect our stock based compensation expense for 2010 and future periods will increase significantly. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about stock based compensation. Income Taxes We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying the enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. We may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

We record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues. We currently generate all our revenues in the United States, although we plan to launch a limited international expansion with a streaming subscription service in 2010. We offer a variety of subscription plans combining streaming movies and TV episodes over the Internet and sending DVDs by mail. The price per plan varies based on the number of DVDs that a subscriber has out at any given point and based on whether the service has limited or unlimited usage. All of our unlimited plans allow the subscriber unlimited streaming to their computer or Netflix Ready Device. The vast majority of our subscriber base has chosen a 1, 2 or 3 out Unlimited plan. Customers electing access to the high definition Blu ray discs in addition to standard definition DVDs pay a surcharge ranging from $1 to $4 for our most popular plans. Pricing of our plans is as follows: Price permonth 1 out Limited $ 4.99 1 out Unlimited 8.99 2 out Unlimited 13.99 3 out Unlimited 16.99 All other Unlimited Plans 23.99 to 47.99 31 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs 2008 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthlyrevenue per paying subscriber) Revenues $ 1,670,269 $ 1,364,661 22.4 % Other data: Average number of paying subscribers 10,464 8,268 26.6 % Average monthly revenue per paying subscriber $ 13.30 $ 13.75 (3.3 )% The $305.6 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 26.6% growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and DVDs by mail for one low price and other benefits of our service. This increase was offset in part by a 3.3% decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans. The total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2 out plans grew by 48.1% as compared to a 1.1% decline in all other plans during the year ended December 31, 2009. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthlyrevenue per paying subscriber) Revenues $ 1,364,661 $ 1,205,340 13.2 % Other data: Average number of paying subscribers 8,268 6,718 23.1 % Average monthly revenue per paying subscriber $ 13.75 $ 14.95 (8.0 )% The $159.3 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 23.1% growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and DVDs by mail for one low price and other benefits of our service. This increase was offset in part by an 8.0% decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans, as well as a price reduction for our most popular subscription plans during the third quarter of 2007. The total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2 out plans grew by 39.8% as compared to 6.1% in all other plans during the year ended December 31, 2008. Until the average price paid by our new subscriber additions is equal to the average price paid by existing subscribers, we expect our average monthly revenue per paying subscriber will continue to decline, as the lower priced plans grow as a percentage of our subscriber base. This decline could be partially offset by the growth in the number of subscribers electing to receive Blu ray discs for a surcharge as described above. Our revenues and average monthly revenue per paying subscriber could be impacted by future changes to our pricing structure which may result from competitive effects that we are unable to predict. The following table presents our year end subscriber information: As of December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Free subscribers 376 226 153 As a percentage of total subscribers 3.1 % 2.4 % 2.0 % Paid subscribers 11,892 9,164 7,326 As a percentage of total subscribers 96.9 % 97.6 % 98.0 % Total subscribers 12,268 9,390 7,479 Percentage change over prior period 30.6 % 25.6 % 32 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues Cost of Subscription Cost of subscription revenues consists of content delivery costs related to shipping DVDs and providing streaming content to subscribers as well as expenses related to the acquisition of content. Costs related to free trial periods are allocated to marketing expenses. Content delivery expenses consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our paying subscribers, the packaging and label costs for the mailers and all costs associated with streaming content over the Internet. We utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream content in high volume to our subscribers over the Internet. Content acquisition expenses consist of costs incurred in obtaining content such as amortization of content and revenue sharing expense. We obtain content from studios, distributors and other suppliers through direct purchases, revenue sharing agreements and license agreements. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of subscription $ 909,461 $ 761,133 19.5 % As a percentage of revenues 54.4 % 55.8 % The $148.3 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors: Content delivery expenses increased $101.7 million primarily due to an 18.6% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers. The increase in the number of DVDs mailed was driven by a 26.6% increase in the average number of paying subscribers, partially offset by a 6.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber primarily attributed to the growing popularity of our lower priced plans. Content acquisition expenses increased by $46.6 million. This increase was primarily attributable to investments in streaming content. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of subscription $ 761,133 $ 664,407 14.6 % As a percentage of revenues 55.8 % 55.1 % The $96.7 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors: Content delivery expenses increased $72.7 million primarily due to a 19.0% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers. The increase in the number of DVDs mailed was driven by a 23.1% increase in the average number of paying subscribers, partially offset by a 3.2% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber primarily attributed to the growing popularity of our lower priced plans. The increase is also due to an increase in the rates of first class postage in May 2008. Content acquisition expenses increased by $24.0 million This increase was primarily attributable to the increased investments in streaming content, as well as an increase in DVD revenue sharing costs. 33 Table of Contents Fulfillment Expenses Fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers, including costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing our content library. Fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Fulfillment expenses $ 169,810 $ 149,101 13.9 % As a percentage of revenues 10.2 % 10.9 % The $20.7 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following: Shipping and customer service centers expenses increased $10.5 million primarily due to a 14.0% increase in headcount to support the higher volume of content delivery and growth in subscribers. Credit card fees increased $10.2 million as a result of the 22.4% growth in revenues. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Fulfillment expenses $ 149,101 $ 121,761 22.5 % As a percentage of revenues 10.9 % 10.1 % The $27.3 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following: Shipping and customer service centers expenses increased $22.0 million primarily due to a 29.8% increase in headcount to support the higher volume of content delivery and the addition of new shipping centers. Credit card fees increased $5.3 million as a result of the 13.2% growth in revenues. Gross Margin Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross profit $ 590,998 $ 454,427 30.1 % Gross margin 35.4 % 33.3 % Average monthly gross profit per paying subscriber $ 4.71 $ 4.58 2.8 % The 2.1% increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower DVD content acquisition expenses per DVD mailed and a 6.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber driven by the growing popularity of our lower priced plans. This decline was higher than the decline in average revenue per paying subscriber of 3.3%. This was offset partially by increased investments in our streaming content. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross profit $ 454,427 $ 419,172 8.4 % Gross margin 33.3 % 34.8 % Average monthly gross profit per paying subscriber $ 4.58 $ 5.20 (11.9 )% The 1.5% decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in postage rates effective May 2008 and a reduction in the prices of our most popular subscription plans during the second half of 2007. 34 Table of Contents We expect to continue to make substantial investments in our content library and in particular may increase spending associated with streaming content. These investments would reduce our gross margin to the extent that increases outpace growth in our revenues. Operating Expenses Technology and Development Technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in testing, maintaining and modifying our Web site, our recommendation and merchandising technology, developing solutions for streaming content to subscribers, telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internal use software systems. Technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our Web site and store our data. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Technology and development $ 114,542 $ 89,873 27.4 % As a percentage of revenues 6.9 % 6.6 % The $24.7 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a $17.4 million increase in personnel related costs due to 26.6% growth in headcount to develop solutions for streaming content and continued improvements to our service. The increase is also partly due to a $6.7 million increase in facilities and equipment expenses to support the increased headcount and overall growth of operations. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Technology and development $ 89,873 $ 70,979 26.6 % As a percentage of revenues 6.6 % 5.9 % The $18.9 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a $10.4 million increase in personnel related costs due to 28.0% growth in headcount and an $8.5 million increase in other expenses to develop solutions for streaming content and continued improvements to our service. Marketing Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates including consumer electronics partners. Advertising expenses include marketing program expenditures and other promotional activities, including allocated costs of revenues relating to free trial periods. Also included in marketing expense are payroll related expenses. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Marketing $ 237,744 $ 199,713 19.0 % As a percentage of revenues 14.2 % 14.6 % Other Data: Gross subscriber additions 9,332 6,859 36.1 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 25.48 $ 29.12 (12.5 )% The $38.0 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $21.4 million in spending related to affiliates including our consumer electronics partners. The increase is also due to an 35 Table of Contents $11.5 million increase in marketing program spending, principally in TV and radio advertising and direct mail to promote our hybrid service of streaming content and DVDs by mail. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased primarily due to momentum associated with the launch of new consumer electronics partner devices and the broad appeal of streaming content. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 Marketing $ 199,713 $ 218,212 (8.5 )% As a percentage of revenues 14.6 % 18.1 % Other Data: Gross subscriber additions 6,859 5,340 28.4 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 29.12 $ 40.86 (28.7 )% The $18.5 million decrease in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a $34.2 million decrease in marketing program spending, principally in direct mail and inserts, offset partially by an increase of $11.5 million in spending related to affiliates including our consumer electronics partners. In the second half of 2007, we lowered prices on our most popular subscription plans and decided to partially offset the cost of our investment in lower prices by reducing our spending on marketing programs. The decrease was partially offset by higher personnel related costs due to higher headcount and an increase in the costs of free trial periods due to the 28.4% increase in gross subscriber additions. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to more efficient marketing spending. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance, content acquisition and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 51,333 $ 49,662 3.4 % As a percentage of revenues 3.1 % 3.6 % The $1.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $7.4 million increase in legal costs offset partially by a $2.7 million decrease in costs related to our subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, a $2.1 million release of accruals in 2009 associated with a former class action suit that was settled in 2008, and decreases in personnel related costs. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 49,662 $ 52,404 (5.2 )% As a percentage of revenues 3.6 % 4.3 % The $2.7 million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $2.6 million decrease in costs related to our subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, as well as a $3.2 million decrease in legal costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnel related costs due to a 9.6% increase in headcount. 36 Table of Contents Gain on Disposal of DVDs Gain on disposal of DVDs represents the difference between proceeds from sales of DVDs and associated cost of DVD sales. Cost of DVD sales includes the net book value of the DVDs sold, shipping charges and, where applicable, a contractually specified fee for the DVDs that are subject to revenue sharing agreements. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Gain on disposal of DVDs $ (4,560 ) $ (6,327 ) (27.9 )% As a percentage of revenues (0.3 )% (0.4 )% The $1.8 million decrease in gain on disposal of DVDs was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of retail sales of previously viewed DVDs to subscribers in the first quarter of 2009. We continue to sell previously viewed DVDs through wholesale channels and expect our future gains to continue to be insignificant in relation to our overall operations. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Gain on disposal of DVDs $ (6,327 ) $ (7,196 ) (12.1 )% As a percentage of revenues (0.4 )% (0.5 )% The $0.9 million decrease in gain on disposal of DVDs in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to a decrease in the sales price of DVDs. Gain on Legal Settlement On June 25, 2007, we resolved a pending patent litigation with Blockbuster, Inc. As part of the settlement, we received a one time payment of $7.0 million during the second quarter of 2007. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of the interest on our lease financing obligations and the interest on our 8.50% senior notes including the amortization of debt issuance costs. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we expensed the debt issuance costs related to our line of credit. In June 2004 and June 2006, we entered into two separate lease arrangements whereby we leased a building that was constructed by a third party. As discussed in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, we have accounted for these leases in accordance with ASC topic 840.40 Leases Sale Leaseback Transactions as it applies to situations in which an entity is involved with the construction funding of an asset that will be leased when the construction project is completed. This guidance requires Netflix to be considered the owner (for accounting purposes) of the two buildings. 37 Table of Contents Accordingly, we have recorded assets on our balance sheet for the costs paid by our lessor to construct our headquarters facilities, along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessor paid construction costs. The monthly rent payments we make to our lessor under our lease agreements are recorded in our financial statements as land lease expense and principal and interest on the financing liabilities. Interest expense on lease financing obligations reflects the portion of our monthly lease payments that is allocated to interest expense. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest Expense $ 6,475 $ 2,458 163.4 % As a percentage of revenues 0.4 % 0.2 % The $4.0 million increase in interest expense is entirely attributable to the interest expense associated with our 8.50% senior notes and line of credit. Interest expense in 2009 includes $2.8 million for our lease financing obligations, $2.6 million of interest payments due on our notes and $1.1 million of amortization of debt issuance costs. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest Expense $ 2,458 $ 1,188 106.9 % As a percentage of revenues 0.2 % 0.1 % The $1.3 million increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the interest on our lease financing obligations arising when the lease term for the second of our headquarter buildings commenced. Interest and Other Income (Expense) Interest and other income (expense) consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and short term investments. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income (expense) $ 6,728 $ 12,452 (46.0 )% As a percentage of revenues 0.4 % 0.9 % The $5.7 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily attributable to lower cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock, and a $1.6 million decrease in realized gains recognized as compared to the prior year. The decrease was offset by a $1.8 million dollar gain realized in 2009 on the sale of our investment in a private company which we accounted for under the cost method. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income (expense) $ 12,452 $ 20,340 (38.8 )% As a percentage of revenues 0.9 % 1.7 % The $7.9 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily a result of the lower cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock. The decrease was offset by a $2.4 million increase in realized gains. 38 Table of Contents Interest and dividend income was approximately $3.7 million, $9.2 million and $19.7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest and other income included gains of approximately $1.5 million, $3.1 million and $0.7 million on the sale of short term investments in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 76,332 $ 48,474 57.5 % Effective tax rate 39.7 % 36.9 % In 2009, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes of $10 million or 5% of income before income tax. This was partially offset by Federal and California research and development (R&D) tax credits of $2 million. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2008 for prior period R&D tax credits. Year ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2008 vs. 2007 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 48,474 $ 44,317 9.4 % Effective tax rate 36.9 % 40.0 % In 2008, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes of $5 million or 4% of income before income tax. This was partially offset by R&D tax credits of $3 million. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2008 for prior period R&D tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001. Many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including, but not limited to, the price of our service, the number of subscribers who sign up for our service and the growth or reduction in our subscriber base. In September 2009, we entered into a credit agreement which provided for a $100 million three year revolving credit facility. In October 2009, the Company borrowed $20 million under the credit agreement. In November 2009, we issued $200 million of our 8.50% senior notes due in 2017. In connection with the notes offering, we repaid all outstanding amounts under our credit agreement and terminated it. Although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require or choose to obtain additional financing. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations. Additionally, debt financing has also been a source of liquidity in fiscal 2009. Our primary uses of cash include our stock repurchase programs, shipping and packaging expenses, the acquisition of content, capital expenditures related to information technology and automation equipment for operations, marketing and fulfillment expenses. In addition, on August 6, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program through the end of 2010 allowing us to repurchase $300 million of our common stock of which we have purchased $149.1 million as of December 31, 2009. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we purchased an 39 Table of Contents additional $62.4 million of our common stock under the program. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. The following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 134,224 $ 139,881 $ 177,439 Short term investments 186,018 157,390 207,703 $ 320,242 $ 297,271 $ 385,142 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 325,063 $ 284,037 $ 277,424 Net cash used in investing activities $ (246,079 ) $ (144,960 ) $ (436,024 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (84,641 ) $ (176,635 ) $ (64,391 ) Operating Activities During 2009, our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $115.9 million, increased by non cash adjustments of $254.9 million and offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $45.7 million. The majority of the non cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $219.5 million which increased by $9.7 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base. The decrease in cash flow attributable to the net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content library related to our streaming content, as we continued to increase our investments in streaming content in 2009. Cash provided by operating activities increased $41.0 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. This was primarily due to an increase in net income of $32.8 million, increased non cash adjustments of $27.3 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $19.1 million. During 2008, our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $83.0 million, increased by non cash adjustments of $227.6 million offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $26.6 million. The majority of the non cash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of $209.8 million which increased by $6.3 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base. The decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content library related to our streaming content, as we continued to increase our investments in streaming content in 2008. Cash provided by operating activities increased $6.6 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. This was primarily due to an increase in net income of $16.4 million, increased non cash adjustments of $32.3 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $42.1 million. Investing Activities Our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities, acquisitions of DVD content library and purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities increased $101.1 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. This increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short term investments of $105.0 million offset partially by a decrease in the purchases of short term investments of $29.0 million. In addition, acquisitions of DVDs increased by $30.2 million. Cash used in investing activities decreased $291.1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the purchases of short term investments of $148.4 million coupled with an increase in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short term investments of $106.5 million. In addition, acquisitions of DVDs decreased by $45.8 million as more DVDs were obtained through revenue sharing agreements in 2008. 40 Table of Contents Financing Activities Our financing activities consist primarily of issuance of debt, repurchases of our common stock, issuance of common stock, and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation. Cash used by financing activities decreased by $92.0 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the $193.9 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 8.50% senior notes and a $16.4 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock through option exercises and through our employee stock purchase plan. In addition, the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation increased by $7.5 million in 2009. These cash inflows were offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock of $124.4 million. Cash used by financing activities increased by $112.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in stock repurchases of $100.0 million. In addition, the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation decreased by $21.0 million in 2008, as remaining benefits from net operating losses were utilized. This use of cash was offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of $9.3 million. Contractual Obligations For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2009. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual obligations (in thousands): Total Less than1 year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 years 8.50% senior notes $ 336,472 $ 17,472 $ 34,000 $ 34,000 $ 251,000 Operating lease obligations 40,347 13,313 17,354 7,812 1,868 Lease financing obligations 12,399 3,901 8,102 396 Other purchase obligations (1) 388,056 235,435 145,252 7,369 Total $ 777,274 $ 270,121 $ 204,708 $ 49,577 $ 252,868 (1) Other purchase obligations relate primarily to acquisitions for our content library and to marketing activities. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $13.2 million and an additional $0.9 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. License Agreements In addition to the above contractual obligations, we have certain license agreements with studios that include a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future. Access to these titles is based on the discretion of the studios and, as such, we may not receive these titles. If we did receive access to the maximum number of titles, we would incur up to an additional $6 million in commitments during 2010. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not engaged in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not presently subject to off balance sheet risks. 41 Table of Contents Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2009, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2009, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset and mortgage backed securities. Approximately 52% of the portfolio is invested in government and agency issued securities. At December 31, 2009, we had securities classified as short term investments of $186.0 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. (in thousands) Due within one year $ 44,455 Due within five years 137,763 Due within ten years Due after ten years 3,800 Total $ 186,018 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2009. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. This methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment. 42 Table of Contents The following tables present the hypothetical fair values (in $ thousands) of our debt securities classified as short term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 31, 2009: Fair Value December 31, 2009 150 BPS 100 BPS 50 BPS +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS $ 190,243 $ 188,835 $ 187,426 $ 184,610 $ 183,201 $ 181,793
