Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview With 20 million subscribers as of December 31, 2010, we are the worlds leading Internet subscription service for enjoying TV shows and movies. Our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited TV shows and movies streamed over the Internet to their TVs, computers and mobile devices and, in the United States, subscribers can also receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes. Our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business within the United States and globally. We are continuously improving the customer experience, with a focus on expanding our streaming content, enhancing our user interfaces, and extending our streaming service to even more Internet connected devices, while staying within the parameters of our operating margin targets. By continuously improving the customer experience, we believe we drive additional subscriber growth in the following ways: Additional subscriber growth enables us to obtain more content, which in turn drives more subscriber growth. Additional subscriber growth leads to greater word of mouth promotion of our service, which in turn leads to more subscriber growth at an increasingly cost effective marketing spend. Additional subscriber growth enables us to invest in further improvements to our service offering, which in turn leads to more subscriber growth. The following represents our performance highlights for 2010, 2009 and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands, except per share data) Revenues $ 2,162,625 $ 1,670,269 $ 1,364,661 Operating income 283,641 191,939 121,506 Net income 160,853 115,860 83,026 Net income per share diluted $ 2.96 $ 1.98 $ 1.32 Total subscribers at end of period 20,010 12,268 9,390 Net subscriber additions 7,742 2,878 1,911 The increase in total subscribers, as well as the acceleration in our net subscriber additions, has fueled the significant growth in our revenues. These increases are offset partially by a reduction in the average revenue per paying subscriber which reflects the popularity of our lower priced plans. In 2010, we passed a significant milestone with the majority of our subscribers viewing more of their TV shows and movies via streaming than by DVD. Streaming hours are currently growing faster than DVD hours and while DVD shipments have grown 9.7% in 2010, we expect shipments will be flat to declining in future periods. In September 2010, we began international operations by offering an unlimited streaming plan without DVDs in Canada. Substantially all of our revenues, operating income and net income are still generated in the United States; however initial results from our Canada expansion indicate positive operating margins may be achieved during 2011. As a result of this early success, we anticipate further international expansion into 22 Table of Contents additional markets in the second half of 2011 and will manage our business going forward with two distinct operating segments: United States and International. In 2011 operating margins for the United States are expected to increase, while international operating margins are expected to be negative as we invest in our international operations. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues: Subscription 53.4 54.4 55.8 Fulfillment expenses 9.4 10.2 10.9 Total cost of revenues 62.8 64.6 66.7 Gross margin 37.2 35.4 33.3 Operating expenses: Technology and development 7.6 6.9 6.6 Marketing 13.6 14.2 14.6 General and administrative 3.3 3.1 3.6 Gain on disposal of DVDs (0.4 ) (0.3 ) (0.4 ) Total operating expenses 24.1 23.9 24.4 Operating income 13.1 11.5 8.9 Other income (expense): Interest expense (0.9 ) (0.4 ) (0.2 ) Interest and other income 0.2 0.4 0.9 Income before income taxes 12.4 11.5 9.6 Provision for income taxes 5.0 4.6 3.5 Net income 7.4 % 6.9 % 6.1 % Revenues We derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably over each subscribers monthly subscription period. We record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues. We currently generate substantially all of our revenues in the United States. In 2010, we began international operations by offering an unlimited streaming plan without DVDs in Canada. We anticipate further international expansion in the second half of 2011. We offer subscription plans in the United States and Canada that allow our subscribers to instantly watch unlimited TV shows and movies streamed over the Internet to their TVs, computers and mobile devices. In the United States, we offer a variety of subscription plans that in addition to streaming, offer subscribers DVDs by mail. The price per plan varies based on the number of DVDs that a subscriber has out at any given point. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 85% of our subscriber base has chosen either the unlimited streaming plan without DVDs at $7.99 per month or a 1 or 2 DVD out unlimited plan, which are priced at $9.99 and $14.99 per month, respectively. Customers electing access to high definition Blu ray discs in addition to standard definition DVDs pay a surcharge ranging from $1 to $4 for our most popular plans. 23 Table of Contents The following table presents our year end subscriber information: As of December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Free subscribers 1,742 376 226 As a percentage of total subscribers (1) 8.7 % 3.1 % 2.4 % Paid subscribers 18,268 11,892 9,164 As a percentage of total subscribers 91.3 % 96.9 % 97.6 % Total subscribers 20,010 12,268 9,390 Percentage change over prior period 63.1 % 30.6 % (1) The 5.6 percentage point increase in free subscribers as a percentage of total subscribers as of December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009 is due to the expanded use of our one month free trial subscriptions over the previously used two week free trials, as well as increased demand during the holiday season. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthly revenue per paying subscriber) Revenues $ 2,162,625 $ 1,670,269 29.5 % Other data: Average number of paying subscribers 14,786 10,464 41.3 % Average monthly revenue per paying subscriber $ 12.19 $ 13.30 (8.3 )% The $492.4 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 41.3% growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from the continuous improvement to our customer experience which in turn, drives consumer awareness of our service benefits. This increase was offset in part by an 8.3% decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans. The total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2 out plans grew by 69.8% as compared to a 15.0% decline in all other plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, when we introduced the unlimited streaming plan without DVDs, over one third of new subscribers elected this option. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthly revenue per paying subscriber) Revenues $ 1,670,269 $ 1,364,661 22.4 % Other data: Average number of paying subscribers 10,464 8,268 26.6 % Average monthly revenue per paying subscriber $ 13.30 $ 13.75 (3.3 )% The $305.6 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 26.6% growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and DVDs by mail for one low price and other benefits of our service. This increase was offset in part by a 3.3% decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans. The total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2 out plans grew by 48.1% as compared to a 1.1% decline in all other plans during the year ended December 31, 2009. Until the average price paid by our new subscriber additions is equal to the average price paid by existing subscribers, our average monthly revenue per paying subscriber will continue to decline. We expect lower priced plans to continue to grow as a percentage of our subscriber base. 24 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues Cost of Subscription Cost of subscription revenues consists of expenses related to the acquisition and licensing of content, as well as content delivery costs related to providing streaming content and shipping DVDs to subscribers. Costs related to free trial periods are allocated to marketing expenses. Content acquisition and licensing expenses consist primarily of amortization of streaming content licenses, amortization of DVD library and revenue sharing expenses. We obtain content through streaming content license agreements, DVD direct purchases and DVD and streaming revenue sharing agreements with studios, distributors and other suppliers. Content delivery expenses consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our paying subscribers, the packaging and label costs for the mailers and all costs associated with streaming content over the Internet. We utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream content in high volume to our subscribers over the Internet. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of subscription $ 1,154,109 $ 909,461 26.9 % As a percentage of revenues 53.4 % 54.4 % The $244.6 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors: Content acquisition and licensing expenses increased by $165.9 million. This increase was primarily attributable to investments in streaming content, partially offset by decreases in DVD content acquisitions. Content delivery expenses increased $78.7 million primarily due to a 9.7% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers. The increase in the number of DVDs mailed was driven by a 41.3% increase in the average number of paying subscribers, partially offset by a 22.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber primarily attributed to the growing popularity of our lower priced plans and growth in streaming. In addition, content delivery expenses increased due to higher costs associated with our use of third party delivery networks resulting from an increase in the total number of hours of streaming content viewed by our subscribers. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of subscription $ 909,461 $ 761,133 19.5 % As a percentage of revenues 54.4 % 55.8 % The $148.3 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors: Content delivery expenses increased $101.7 million primarily due to an 18.6% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers. The increase in the number of DVDs mailed was driven by a 26.6% increase in the average number of paying subscribers, partially offset by a 6.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber primarily attributed to the growing popularity of our lower priced plans. Content acquisition and licensing expenses increased by $46.6 million. This increase was primarily attributable to investments in streaming content. 25 Table of Contents Fulfillment Expenses Fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in content processing, including operating and staffing our shipping centers, as well as receiving, encoding, inspecting and warehousing our content library. Fulfillment expenses also include operating and staffing our customer service centers and credit card fees. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages) Fulfillment expenses $ 203,246 $ 169,810 19.7 % As a percentage of revenues 9.4 % 10.2 % The $33.4 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following: Shipping and customer service centers expenses increased $13.4 million primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in personnel costs resulting from a 10.0% increase in headcount to support the higher volume of content delivery and growth in subscribers. In addition, encoding costs increased $7.0 million in support of the increasing number of titles and platforms offered for streaming content. These increases were partially offset by a $4.7 million increase in costs related to free trials allocated to marketing due primarily to the 74.7% increase in gross subscriber additions. Credit card fees increased $20.0 million as a result of the 29.5% growth in revenues. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Fulfillment expenses $ 169,810 $ 149,101 13.9 % As a percentage of revenues 10.2 % 10.9 % The $20.7 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following: Shipping and customer service centers expenses increased $10.5 million primarily due to a 14.0% increase in headcount to support the higher volume of content delivery and growth in subscribers. Credit card fees increased $10.2 million as a result of the 22.4% growth in revenues. Gross Margin Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthlygross profit per paying subscriber) Gross profit $ 805,270 $ 590,998 36.3 % Gross margin 37.2 % 35.4 % Average monthly gross profit per paying subscriber $ 4.54 $ 4.71 (3.6 )% 26 Table of Contents The 1.8 percentage point increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower DVD content acquisition expenses per DVD mailed and a 22.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber driven by the growing popularity of our lower priced plans and streaming. This decline in DVD usage was larger than the decline in average revenue per paying subscriber of 8.3%. The resulting increase to gross margin was offset partially by increased investments in our streaming content. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages and average monthlygross profit per paying subscriber) Gross profit $ 590,998 $ 454,427 30.1 % Gross margin 35.4 % 33.3 % Average monthly gross profit per paying subscriber $ 4.71 $ 4.58 2.8 % The 2.1 percentage point increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower DVD content acquisition expenses per DVD mailed and a 6.3% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber driven by the growing popularity of our lower priced plans. This decline was larger than the decline in average revenue per paying subscriber of 3.3%. The resulting increase to gross margin was offset partially by increased investments in our streaming content. We have increased and expect to continue to increase investments in content, in particular streaming content. These investments would reduce our gross margin to the extent that increases in content acquisition and licensing expenses outpace growth in our revenues. Operating Expenses Technology and Development Technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offering, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interfaces, our recommendation and merchandising technology, as well as, telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internal use software systems. Technology and development expenses also include costs associated with computer hardware and software, as well as certain costs paid for third party Internet based or cloud computing services used in connection with our business. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages) Technology and development $ 163,329 $ 114,542 42.6 % As a percentage of revenues 7.6 % 6.9 % The $48.8 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a $27.7 million increase in personnel related costs and a $14.2 million increase in facilities and equipment related expenses. These increases are primarily due to a 21% growth in headcount supporting continued improvements to our service. Personnel related costs also increased due to a $5.7 million increase in stock based compensation. In addition, costs paid for cloud computing services increased $7.7 million. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Technology and development $ 114,542 $ 89,873 27.4 % As a percentage of revenues 6.9 % 6.6 % The $24.7 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a $17.4 million increase in personnel related costs due to 26.6% growth in headcount to develop solutions for streaming 27 Table of Contents content and continued improvements to our service. The increase is also partly due to a $6.7 million increase in facilities and equipment expenses to support the increased headcount and overall growth of operations. Marketing Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners and payroll related expenses. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as television and online advertising as well as, allocated costs of revenues relating to free trial periods. Payments to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners, may be in the form of a fixed fee or may be a revenue sharing payment. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages andsubscriber acquisition cost) Marketing $ 293,839 $ 237,744 23.6 % As a percentage of revenues 13.6 % 14.2 % Other Data: Gross subscriber additions 16,301 9,332 74.7 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 18.03 $ 25.48 (29.2 )% The $56.1 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $17.4 million in spending related to our consumer electronics partners, as we continued to expand the number of devices on which subscribers can view Netflix content. The increase is also due to a $16.2 million increase in other marketing program spending, principally in TV and radio advertising to promote our service, offset by a decrease in direct mail and inserts. In addition, costs of free trials increased $21.0 million due to the 74.7% increase in gross subscriber additions, coupled with shipments of instant streaming discs which enable subscribers to stream content to certain consumer electronic devices and the expanded use of one month free trials. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased primarily due to continued strong organic subscriber growth. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages andsubscriber acquisition cost) Marketing $ 237,744 $ 199,713 19.0 % As a percentage of revenues 14.2 % 14.6 % Other Data: Gross subscriber additions 9,332 6,859 36.1 % Subscriber acquisition cost $ 25.48 $ 29.12 (12.5 )% The $38.0 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of $21.4 million in spending related to affiliates including our consumer electronics partners. The increase is also due to an $11.5 million increase in other marketing program spending, principally in TV and radio advertising and direct mail to promote our service. Subscriber acquisition cost decreased primarily due to momentum associated with the launch of new consumer electronics partner devices and the broad appeal of streaming content. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive, finance, content acquisition and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting, professional fees and other general corporate expenses. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 70,555 $ 51,333 37.4 % As a percentage of revenues 3.3 % 3.1 % 28 Table of Contents The $19.2 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs of $11.7 million attributed to a $7.6 million increase in stock based compensation and a 23.1% increase in headcount. Legal costs increased $8.9 million primarily resulting from ongoing litigation of claims against the Company as well as a $2.1 million release of accruals in 2009 that was associated with a former class action suit that settled in 2008. The terms of the class action settlement provided certain former and current subscribers with an optional free month subscription or free one month upgrade to be utilized prior to the third quarter of 2009. The accrual related to those subscribers who did not utilize the free month prior to expiration was released in 2009. We expect legal costs to continue at a high level for the foreseeable future as we defend these claims. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 51,333 $ 49,662 3.4 % As a percentage of revenues 3.1 % 3.6 % The $1.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $7.4 million increase in legal costs resulting from ongoing litigation of claims against the Company. This increase is offset partially by a $2.7 million decrease in costs related to a significant reduction in the level of operations of our subsidiary, Red Envelope Entertainment, and a $2.1 million release of accruals in 2009 associated with a former class action suit that was settled in 2008. The terms of the class action settlement provided certain former and current subscribers with an optional free month subscription or free one month upgrade to be utilized prior to the third quarter of 2009. The accrual related to those subscribers who did not utilize the free month prior to expiration was released. We also had decreases in personnel related costs due to lower headcount as we streamline our administrative functions. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of the interest on our lease financing obligations and the interest on our 8.50% senior notes including the amortization of debt issuance costs. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we expensed the debt issuance costs related to our line of credit. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest Expense $ 19,629 $ 6,475 203.2 % As a percentage of revenues 0.9 % 0.4 % The $13.2 million increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense associated with our 8.50% senior notes. Interest expense in 2010 includes $2.3 million for our lease financing obligations, $17.0 million of interest payments due on our notes and $0.5 million of amortization of debt issuance costs. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest Expense $ 6,475 $ 2,458 163.4 % As a percentage of revenues 0.4 % 0.2 % The $4.0 million increase in interest expense is entirely attributable to the interest expense associated with our 8.50% senior notes and line of credit. Interest expense in 2009 includes $2.8 million for our lease financing obligations, $2.6 million of interest payments due on our notes and $1.1 million of amortization of debt issuance costs. 29 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and short term investments. Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income $ 3,684 $ 6,728 (45.2 )% As a percentage of revenues 0.2 % 0.4 % The $3.0 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily attributable to a $1.8 million dollar gain realized in 2009 on the sale of our investment in a private company which we had accounted for under the cost method, coupled with lower average cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income $ 6,728 $ 12,452 (46.0 )% As a percentage of revenues 0.4 % 0.9 % The $5.7 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily attributable to lower cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock, and a $1.6 million decrease in realized gains recognized as compared to the prior year. The decrease was offset by a $1.8 million dollar gain realized in 2009 on the sale of our investment in a private company which we accounted for under the cost method. Interest and dividend income was approximately $2.7 million, $3.7 million and $9.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest and other income included gains of approximately $1.0 million, $1.5 million and $3.1 million on the sale of short term investments in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 2010 vs. 2009 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 106,843 $ 76,332 40.0 % Effective tax rate 39.9 % 39.7 % In 2010, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes of $15.6 million or 5.8% of income before income tax. This was partially offset by Federal and California research and development (R&D) tax credits of $3.3 million. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was relatively flat as compared to our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was signed into law. One of the major components of this legislation is the reinstatement of the Federal R&D Credit retroactively to January 1, 2010. As a result, we recorded a Federal R&D Credit of approximately $1.8 million as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2010. Year ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 2009 vs. 2008 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 76,332 $ 48,474 57.5 % Effective tax rate 39.7 % 36.9 % 30 Table of Contents In 2009, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% principally due to state income taxes of $10.4 million or 5.4% of income before income tax. This was partially offset by Federal and California R&D tax credits of $1.6 million. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2008 for prior period R&D tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations. Additionally, in November 2009, we issued $200 million of our 8.50% senior notes due in 2017. Our primary uses of cash include payroll, advertising and payments to consumer electronics partners, stock repurchases, acquisition and licensing of content, content delivery, fulfillment expenses, taxes and capital expenditures related to information technology and automation equipment. We expect to continue to make substantial investments to obtain content, and in particular expect to increase spending associated with streaming content. Streaming content commitments have grown and continue to grow as we typically enter into multi year, fixed fee licenses. These investments could impact our liquidity and in particular our operating cash flows. Although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require or choose to obtain additional financing. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. On June 11, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2012. As of December 31, 2010, $240.6 million of this authorization is remaining. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, debt covenant requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. The following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 194,499 $ 134,224 $ 139,881 Short term investments 155,888 186,018 157,390 $ 350,387 $ 320,242 $ 297,271 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 276,401 $ 325,063 $ 284,037 Net cash used in investing activities $ (116,081 ) $ (246,079 ) $ (144,960 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (100,045 ) $ (84,641 ) $ (176,635 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $48.7 million or 15.0% during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to increased spending for content acquisition and licensing other than DVD library of $267.8 million. This increase was coupled with increased content delivery expenses of $78.7 million primarily resulting from a 9.7% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers and higher costs associated with our use of third party delivery networks to deliver streaming content, increased promotional advertising activities and expenses related to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners totaling $33.6 million, increased payroll expenses of $36.2 million due to a 11% increase in employees, increased fulfillment expenses of $33.4 million, and increased current tax provision of 31 Table of Contents $30.5 million. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock based compensation increased by $49.5 million. The increase in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in subscription revenues of $492.4 million resulting from a 41.3% increase in the average number of paying subscribers. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $41.0 million or 14.4% during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues of $305.6 million resulting from a 26.6% increase in the average number of paying subscribers. This increase in subscription revenues was partially offset by an increase in spending for content acquisition and licensing other than DVD library of $67.7 million. This increase was coupled with increased content delivery expenses of $101.7 million primarily resulting from an 18.6% increase in the number of DVDs mailed to paying subscribers and higher costs associated with our use of third party delivery networks to deliver streaming content, increased promotional advertising activities and expenses related to our affiliates and consumer electronic partners totaling $32.9 million, increased payroll expenses of $27.3 million due to a 25% increase in employees, increased fulfillment expenses of $20.7 million, and increased current tax provision of $27.9 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $130.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a $120.6 million decrease in the purchases of available for sale securities and a $69.1 million decrease in acquisitions of DVD content library, as more DVDs were obtained through revenue sharing arrangements. In addition, purchases of property and equipment decreased by $12.1 million, as a significant amount of payments for automation equipment for our various shipping centers were made in 2009. This decrease was partially offset by a $65.7 million decrease in proceeds from the sales and maturities of available for sale securities. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $101.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a $105.0 million decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of available for sale securities partially offset by a decrease in the purchases of available for sale securities of $29.0 million. In addition, acquisitions of DVDs increased by $30.2 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $15.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the $193.9 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 8.50% senior notes in 2009. This decrease was partially offset by a $114.1 million decrease in repurchases of our common stock coupled with a $49.5 million increase in the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and a $14.5 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $92.0 million as compared to 2008 primarily due to the $193.9 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 8.50% senior notes and a $16.4 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock. In addition, the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation increased by $7.5 million in 2009. These cash inflows were offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock of $124.4 million. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the non operational cash flows from purchases and sales of short term investments and cash flows from investments in businesses. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, repurchase our stock, and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is considered a non GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow from operating 32 Table of Contents activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) Non GAAP free cash flow reconciliation: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 276,401 $ 325,063 $ 284,037 Acquisition of DVD content library (123,901 ) (193,044 ) (162,849 ) Purchases of property and equipment (33,837 ) (45,932 ) (43,790 ) Acquisition of intangible assets (505 ) (200 ) (1,062 ) Proceeds from sale of DVDs 12,919 11,164 18,368 Other assets (70 ) 71 (1 ) Non GAAP free cash flow $ 131,007 $ 97,122 $ 94,703 Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $33.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to lower DVD content library and property and equipment expenditures. These reduced spending levels more than offset the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities described above. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $2.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to an increase in cash flow from operations, offset by higher DVD content library expenditures and a decrease in the proceeds from sale of previously viewed DVDs. Contractual Obligations For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2010. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010: Payments due by Period Contractual obligations (in thousands): Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years 8.50% senior notes $ 319,000 $ 17,000 $ 34,000 $ 34,000 $ 234,000 Operating lease obligations 53,038 13,693 21,995 12,304 5,046 Lease financing obligations (1) 23,573 4,184 7,372 5,886 6,131 Content obligations (2) 1,299,176 530,878 531,698 236,600 Other purchase obligations 157,957 85,546 68,036 4,375 Total $ 1,852,744 $ 651,301 $ 663,101 $ 293,165 $ 245,177 (1) In the first quarter of 2010, we extended the facilities leases for the Los Gatos buildings. See note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our lease financing obligations. (2) Content obligations include agreements to acquire and license content that represent long term liabilities or that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate what the total obligation may be beyond any minimum quantities and/ or pricing as of the reporting date. For those agreements that include renewal provisions that are solely at the option of the content provider, we include the commitments associated with the renewal period to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. For these reasons, the amounts presented in the table may not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows. 33 Table of Contents We have entered into certain license agreements that include an unspecified or a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future and or that include pricing contingent upon certain variables, such as domestic theatrical exhibition receipts for the title. As of the reporting date, it is unknown whether we will receive access to these titles or what the ultimate price per title will be. Accordingly such amounts are not reflected in the above contractual obligations table. However such amounts are expected to be significant. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $20.7 million and an additional $1.7 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not engaged in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not presently subject to off balance sheet risks. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Content Accounting We obtain content through streaming content license agreements, DVD direct purchases and DVD and streaming revenue sharing agreements with studios, distributors and other suppliers. We obtain content distribution rights in order to stream TV shows and movies to subscribers TVs, computers and mobile devices. Streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement. The license agreement may or may not be recognized in content library. 34 Table of Contents When the streaming license fee is known or reasonably determinable for a specific title and the specific title is first available for streaming to subscribers, the title is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as current content library for the portion available for streaming within one year and as non current content library for the remaining portion. New titles recognized in the content library are classified in the line item Acquisition of streaming content library within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We amortize the content library on a straight line basis over each titles window of availability. The amortization is classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item Amortization of content library within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. For the titles recognized in content library, the license fees due but not paid are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as Accounts payable for the amounts due within one year and as Other non current liabilities for the amounts due beyond one year. Changes in these liabilities are classified in the line items Accounts payable and Other assets and liabilities within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Commitments for the titles not yet available for streaming are not yet recognized in the content library and are included in footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements. When the streaming license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title, the title does not meet the criteria for recognition in the content library. The license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title in fixed fee license agreements that do not specify the number of titles, the license fee per title and the windows of availability per title. Over the term of these agreements, we typically make periodic fixed prepayments that are classified in prepaid content on the consolidated balance sheets. We amortize the license fees on a straight line basis over the term of each license agreement. The amortization is classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item Net income within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Changes in prepaid content are classified within net cash provided by operating activities in the line item Prepaid content in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Commitments for licenses that do not meet the criteria for recognition in the content library are included in footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements. We acquire DVD content for the purpose of renting such content to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues, and, as such, we consider our direct purchase DVD library to be a productive asset. Accordingly, we classify our DVD library as a non current asset on the consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition of DVD content library, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified in the line item Acquisition of DVD content library within cash used in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows because the DVD content library is considered a productive asset. Other companies in the in home entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. We amortize our direct purchase DVDs, less estimated salvage value, on a sum of the months accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The useful life of the new release DVDs and back catalog DVDs is estimated to be one year and three years, respectively. In estimating the useful life of its DVDs, we consider historical utilization patterns, primarily the number of times a DVD title is shipped to subscribers in a given period, as well as an estimate for lost or damaged DVDs. The amortization of the DVD content library is classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statement of operations and in the line item Amortization of content library within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We also obtain DVD and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors. Revenue sharing obligations incurred based on utilization are classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item Net income within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The terms of some revenue sharing agreements obligate us to make a low initial payment for certain titles, representing a minimum contractual obligation under the agreement. The low initial payment is in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee, based on utilization, for a defined period of time, or the title term, which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title. The initial payment may be in the form of an upfront non refundable payment. This payment is capitalized in the content library in accordance with our DVD and streaming content policies as applicable. The initial payment may also be in the form of a prepayment of future 35 Table of Contents revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid content. This payment is amortized as revenue sharing obligations are incurred. If during the title term, we determine that the full prepayment will not be amortized based on utilization, a provision for the estimated difference is recorded in the period that such shortfall is deemed probable. Under the revenue sharing agreements for our DVD library, at the end of the title term, we generally have the option of returning the DVDs to the studio, destroying the DVDs or purchasing the DVDs. In most cases, we purchase the DVDs when we have the ability to do so. This end of term buy out is also included in DVD library at the time of purchase. Stock Based Compensation Stock based compensation cost at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We calculate the fair value of new stock based compensation awards under our stock option plans using a lattice binomial model. We use a Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares. These models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted. Expected Volatility: Our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock. Our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. We include the historical volatility in our computation due to low trade volume of our tradable forward call options in certain periods thereby precluding sole reliance on implied volatility. An increase of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase the total stock based compensation expense by approximately $1.2 million. Suboptimal Exercise Factor: Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise behavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted and is determined for both executives and non executives. An increase in the suboptimal exercise factor of 10% would increase the total stock based compensation by approximately $1.5 million. Income Taxes We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current 36 Table of Contents assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2010, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $20.7 million of which $16.8 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2010, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2010, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset and mortgage backed securities. At December 31, 2010, we had securities classified as short term investments of $155.9 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. (in thousands) Due within one year $ 18,966 Due within five years 134,014 Due within ten years Due after ten years 2,908 Total $ 155,888 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2010. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. This methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment. 37 Table of Contents The following table presents the hypothetical fair values (in $ thousands) of our debt securities classified as short term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 31, 2010: Fair Value December 31, 2010 150 BPS 100 BPS 50 BPS +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS $159,307 $ 158,167 $ 157,028 $ 154,749 $ 153,609 $ 152,469
