ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities. We use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. As is generally the case, our producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by steep declines. As a result, we must 15 locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop, acquire and produce oil and gas reserves. We believe that our working capital and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures in 2002. Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special rules that are unique to the oil and gas business. These rules require us to make several difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. These judgments or estimates primarily relate to the capitalization and amortization of costs and the valuation of oil and gas price hedging activities. Our judgments and estimates have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We believe that the policies described below are critical to the reporting of our financial position and operating results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Our most significant estimates are: remaining proved oil and gas reserves; timing of our future drilling activities; future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties; and the value of derivative positions. For additional risks associated with these items see "Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results" in this Item 7. ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES. Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special rules that are unique to the oil and gas business. Two generally accepted methods for accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of such costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserves. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method provides for a comparison of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires a comparison of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows of related proved reserves, using period end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. Full Cost Method. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are directly related to exploration activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development also are capitalized. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves is a significant component of amortization and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Generally, if reserve volumes increase or decrease, then the amortization rate per unit of production will change inversely. However, when capitalized costs change, the amortization rate moves in the same direction. The per unit rate is not affected by production volumes. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. 16 Future Development and Abandonment Costs. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our offshore production platforms, FPSOs, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically occur many years in the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. A ceiling test writedown is a non cash charge to earnings. If required, it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires the most subjective judgments. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and oil prices decline, even if for only a short period of time, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The future net revenues associated with our estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. With the concurrence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, our impairment calculation uses a hedge adjusted price (net realized price after considering cash flow hedges) applied to the quantity of proved reserves covered by our hedges. Unevaluated Costs. Unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage, unamortized seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are not initially included in our amortization base. Leasehold and seismic costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base if a reduction in value has occurred. The decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of transferring such costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of management judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. Beginning in 2001, the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. All of our derivative instruments represent hedges against the price we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Although our derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value, to the extent that changes in those fair values offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced. To the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the change is recorded in income in the period it occurs. We also record the periodic change in the time value component of the option contracts used in our hedging strategy in income in the period the change occurs. 17 In determining the amounts to be recorded, we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location. Where necessary, we adjust NYMEX prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices. Our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent third parties quotations. WRITEDOWN OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES Based on oil and gas prices in effect on December 31, 2001 ($2.65 per MMBtu for gas and $19.84 per barrel for oil), the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling. In accordance with full cost accounting rules, we recorded a domestic ceiling test writedown at December 31, 2001 of $106 million ($68 million after tax). With the concurrence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the impairment was calculated using a hedge adjusted price. The writedown would have been $184 million ($118 million after tax) if we had not used hedge adjusted prices. Because of the volatility of oil and gas prices, no assurance can be given that we will not experience a ceiling test writedown in future periods.

(2) For purposes of this table, average realized prices for natural gas and oil and condensate are presented net of all applicable transportation expenses, which reduced the realized price of natural gas by $0.03, $0.04 and $0.05 for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The realized price of oil and condensate is reduced by $0.24, $0.27 and $0.32 for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Average realized prices include the effect of hedges. 18 PRODUCTION. Our total oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) increased 25% in 2001 and 23.3% in 2000. Gas production in 2001 was impacted by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately five Bcfe in the fourth quarter of 2001 in response to low commodity prices. Without the curtailment, our production would have increased 29% over 2000 levels. Natural Gas. Our 2001 natural gas production increased 26% over 2000. The significant increase was attributable to a balance between acquisitions and drilling. About half of the production increase in 2001 came from the Mid Continent acquisition, which closed in January 2001. Our development drilling program in South Texas was also a major contributor to our production growth. Following the drilling of six development wells in the East Sarita Field of South Texas, net production increased from about 25 MMcfe/d to a peak of nearly 80 MMcfe/d in the third quarter of 2001. Our onshore Gulf Coast production averaged about 81 MMcfe/d in 2001, a 25% increase over the 65 MMcfe/d we averaged in 2000. The following Gulf of Mexico development projects were also major contributors: West Cameron 294, West Cameron 240 A and High Island A 521. Gains in production were partially offset by natural declines from other producing properties. In 2000, our natural gas volumes increased 21% over 1999. Our acquisition of three producing gas fields in South Texas in early 2000 added about nine Bcfe of production. Development projects in the Gulf of Mexico at Eugene Island 198/199/202, West Cameron 522 and Main Pass 264 also contributed to the production increase. Crude Oil and Condensate. Our crude oil production in 2001 increased 21% over 2000 levels. The increase in 2001 oil production primarily relates to our early 2001 acquisition in the Mid Continent and the success of our drilling efforts. During 2001, our oil production in Australia averaged 4,043 BOPD and accounted for about 21% of our total oil production. Major development projects in the Gulf of Mexico that increased our 2001 oil production were Viosca Knoll 738/739, Eugene Island 182 and Main Pass 138. The increase in 2000 oil production primarily relates to the full year affect of our acquisition of two producing oil fields in Australia and development projects in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2000, our Australian oil production averaged about 4,573 BOPD and accounted for 29% of our total oil production. Major development projects in the Gulf of Mexico that contributed to our increased oil production in 2000 were Vermilion 215, Eugene Island 198/199/202, High Island 474 and Main Pass 138 and 264. Our crude oil and condensate production in 2000 was 32% more than our crude oil production in 1999. EFFECT OF HEDGING ON REALIZED PRICES. The following table presents information about the effect of our hedging program on realized prices. AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES RATIO OF HEDGED TO WITH WITHOUT NON HEDGED HEDGE HEDGE PRICE(1) Natural Gas Year ended December 31, 2001.......................... $ 4.32 $ 4.14 104% Year ended December 31, 2000.......................... $ 3.56 $ 4.05 88% Year ended December 31, 1999.......................... $ 2.32 $ 2.27 102% Crude Oil and Condensate Year ended December 31, 2001.......................... $24.00 $24.17 99% Year ended December 31, 2000.......................... $25.29 $29.71 85% Year ended December 31, 1999.......................... $18.15 $19.31 94% (1) The ratio is determined by dividing the realized price (which includes the effects of hedging) by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities. NET INCOME AND REVENUES. For 2001, we had net income of $119.0 million, or $2.56 per diluted share. These results include an impairment charge of $106 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, and a loss of $4.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, reflecting the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to hedging transactions (FAS 133). This compares to 2000 net income of $132.3 million (which includes a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $2.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share), or $2.93 per diluted share, and 1999 net income of $33.2 million, or $0.79 cents per diluted 19 share. Revenues for 2001 were $749.4 million, 42% above 2000 revenues of $526.6 million. Revenues in 1999 were $287.9 million. The increase in revenues in 2001 was primarily due to a 25% increase in production volumes and higher realized natural gas prices. OPERATING EXPENSES. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two years ended December 31, 2001. UNIT OF PRODUCTION AMOUNT (PER MCFE) (IN MILLIONS) YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, PERCENTAGE DECEMBER 31, PERCENTAGE INCREASE INCREASE 2001 2000 (DECREASE) 2001 2000 (DECREASE) United States: Lease operating................... $0.52 $0.40 30% $ 85,683 $ 51,509 66% Production and other taxes........ 0.09 0.04 125% 14,424 5,643 156% Transportation.................... 0.03 0.05 (40%) 5,569 5,984 (7%) Depreciation, depletion and amortization................... 1.65 1.41 17% 274,893 183,739 50% General and administrative (exclusive of stock compensation).................. 0.24 0.22 9% 39,870 28,426 40% Total operating.............. 2.53 2.17 17% 420,439 275,301 53% Australia: Lease operating................... $1.95 $1.38 41% $ 17,239 $ 13,863 24% Production and other taxes........ 0.35 0.46 (24%) 3,099 4,645 (33%) Transportation....................

The reasons for these increases are described below. The increased lease operating expense per Mcfe reflects higher oilfield service costs in all our domestic focus areas, and relatively higher Australian lease operating expenses associated with the operations and maintenance of our two FPSOs. The increase in production and other taxes is primarily related to higher natural gas prices, our expanding onshore Gulf Coast operations and the acquisition of Mid Continent properties in early 2001. The increase was partly offset by resource rent tax in Australia, which was 33% lower in 2001 compared to 2000 due to unsuccessful drilling efforts. The increase in the domestic DD&A rate is primarily related to lower than expected reserve additions from several of our recently completed wells, increases in the cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and facilities construction and the completion of several higher cost wells. The increase in the Australian DD&A rate is primarily a result of our unsuccessful drilling activities in 2000. 20 The increase on a unit of production basis in G&A expense primarily is due to our growing workforce. Performance based compensation, excluding stock compensation expense, was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter 2001 ceiling test write down. Performance based compensation, a component of general and administrative expense, was $11.6 million, or $0.07 per Mcfe, in 2001 compared to $12.8 million, or $0.09 per Mcfe, in 2000. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two years ended December 31, 2000.

The reasons for these increases are described below. Higher lease operating expense per Mcfe reflects increased oilfield service costs in the Gulf of Mexico, relatively higher Australian lease operating expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of our two FPSOs and production downtime due to in fill drilling operations during the year in Australia. We experienced higher production and other taxes on a unit of production basis due to increased production onshore, including the acquisition of three producing gas fields in South Texas during early 2000. Australian production and other taxes increased primarily due to higher commodity prices. The increase in our domestic DD&A rate is due to several factors, including increases in the cost of drilling goods and services, platforms and facilities construction, industry transportation costs and the completion of several higher cost wells. The Australian DD&A rate increased as a result of our unsuccessful drilling activities in 2000. 21 The increase in G&A expense on a per Mcfe basis is primarily the result of an increase in performance based pay, some non recurring expenses associated with a transition to more sophisticated business systems and our growing workforce. Performance based compensation, excluding stock compensation expense, a component of general and administrative expense, increased from $3.9 million in 1999, or $0.03 per Mcfe, to $12.8 million in 2000, or $0.09 per Mcfe. The increase in performance based compensation is a result of our higher earnings. Performance based pay is limited by profitability. INTEREST EXPENSE. We incur interest expense on our $125 million principal amount 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007, our $175 million principal amount 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 and on borrowings under our reserve based revolving credit facility and money market credit lines. Outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements may vary significantly from period to period. Distributions are paid on our 6.5% convertible trust preferred securities we issued in August 1999.

In 2000, our higher total interest expense was the result of borrowings in January 2000 to finance our acquisition of three producing properties in South Texas for $139 million. UNREALIZED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INCOME. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001, we are now required to record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The $24.8 million of unrealized income for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily represents the change in the time value component of the option contracts used in our hedging strategy. TAXES. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was 35%, 34% and 36%, respectively. The effective tax rate was less than the statutory tax rate in 2000 because the valuation allowance on our Australian net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by $2.3 million primarily as a result of a substantial increase in estimated taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices, estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating and capital costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES WORKING CAPITAL. Our working capital balance is not a good indicator of our liquidity because it fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements. We had working capital of $65.6 million as of December 31, 2001. This compares to $38.5 million at the end of 2000 and $35.2 million at the end of 1999. Historically, we have funded our oil and gas activities through cash flow from operations, equity capital, public debt and bank borrowings. DEBT. In association with our acquisition of Lariat Petroleum in early 2001, we borrowed $265 million through our reserve based revolving credit facility. At year end 2001, we had $120 million outstanding under the credit facility and an additional $9 million outstanding under our money market lines of credit. At year end 2001, our long term debt was $428.6 million, which includes our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 of $125 million and our 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 of $175 million. On January 23, 2001, we acquired Lariat Petroleum for total consideration of approximately $333 million, inclusive of the assumption of debt and certain other obligations of Lariat. The consideration included 22 1.9 million shares of our common stock. We financed the cash portion of the consideration under a new $425 million reserve based revolving credit facility obtained on January 23, 2001 with The Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent. On February 22, 2001, we placed $175 million of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011. The offering was done under an existing shelf registration statement. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. The notes were issued at 99.931% of par to yield 7.635%, with interest payable on each March 1 and September 1, commencing September 1, 2001. The amount available under our credit facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks holding 75% of the aggregate commitments. The borrowing base is reduced by the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our senior notes ($300 million). The borrowing base is currently $510 million and is redetermined at least semi annually. No assurances can be given that the banks will not elect to redetermine the borrowing base in the future. The facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions. The facility matures on January 23, 2004. At February 28, 2002 we had $102 million available under our credit facility and had outstanding borrowings of $108 million. We also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount limited by the credit facility to $40 million. As of February 28, 2002, there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit. Our credit arrangements are not subject to any debt rating or similar triggers or conditions. However, applicable commitment fees and interest rates under our credit facility vary based on our credit rating. CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. Our net cash flow from operations in 2001 increased 59% over 2000 to $502.4 million. The increase is due to significantly higher commodity prices and increased production, partially offset by higher operating expenses. This compares to cash flow from operations in 2000 of $316.4 million. Net cash flow from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities for 2001 was $526.8 million compared to $383.5 million in 2000. The increase is primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and increased production, offset by increased operating expenses. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. In 2001, our capital spending totaled $855 million, including $435 million in acquisitions. The largest component of acquisition spending was our first quarter acquisition of Lariat Petroleum. In 2001, we invested $302 million in development, $97 million in domestic exploration and $21 million internationally. Total spending in 2000 was $379 million. Our 2000 capital spending program included $139 million for acquisitions, $129 million for development, $91 million for domestic exploration and $20 million for international activities. We have budgeted $360 million for capital spending in 2002. The lower budget reflects our anticipation of lower cash flows due to weak commodity prices in early 2002. Approximately $200 million has been budgeted for development, $135 million for domestic exploration and $25 million for international projects. The 2002 estimated exploratory budget is the largest exploration budget in our history. Acquisitions are opportunistic and are not budgeted under our capital program. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing, size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable. We anticipate that our capital expenditure budget for 2002 will be funded principally from cash flow from operations and working capital. We do not anticipate additional borrowings under our credit facility or money market lines of credit during 2002 unless we make another significant acquisition. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which proved properties are acquired. 23 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments, other than hedging contracts, by maturity as of December 31, 2001.

Through December 31, 2001, we had purchased 823,000 shares for total consideration of $24.7 million, an average of $29.97 per share. Additional repurchases may be effected from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately negotiated transactions. No limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program. Subject to applicable securities laws, purchases will be at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate. As of February 28, 2002, no shares had been purchased during the first quarter of 2002. HEDGING We enter into various commodity price hedging contracts with respect to a portion of our anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production. During 2000, approximately 45% of our production was subject to hedge positions. Approximately 68% of our production in 2001 was subject to hedge positions. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counter parties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2001, Bank of Montreal, J Aron & Company and Barclays Bank PLC were the counterparties with respect to 77% of our future hedged production. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Please see the discussion in Note 3 "Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this report. 24 NATURAL GAS. At December 31, 2001, we had outstanding the commodity price hedging contracts set forth in the table below with respect to our U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas production.

WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD AND VOLUME IN CONTRACT PRICE FAIR VALUE TYPE OF CONTRACT MMMBTUS PER MMBTU (IN MILLIONS) January 2002 December 2002 Swaps.......................................... 3,650 $2.62 January 2003 March 2003 Swaps.......................................... 900 2.61 $(0.4) Since December 31, 2001, we have entered into the additional natural gas price hedging contracts with respect to our Gulf Coast natural gas production set forth in the table below. We continue to evaluate additional hedging transactions for 2002 and future years.

As of December 31, 2001, we had outstanding the commodity price hedging contracts set forth in the table below with respect to our U.S. Gulf Coast oil production.

The actual cash price we receive, however, generally is about $2.00 per barrel less than the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate price when adjusted for location and quality differences. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. The estimated fair value of these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. With respect to any particular swap transaction, the counter party is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such transaction, and we are required to make a payment to the counter party if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such transaction. For any particular collar transaction, the counter party is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction, and we are required to make a payment to the counter party if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price of such transaction. For any particular floor transaction, the counter party is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction. We are not required to make any payment in connection with the settlement of a floor transaction. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved its proposed SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 141, all business combinations should be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting; use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited. This statement will apply to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and to all acquired intangible assets. This statement generally will supersede Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Adoption of SFAS No. 142 will 26 result in ceasing amortization of goodwill. This statement should be applied in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entitys statement of financial position at that date, regardless of when those assets were initially recognized. The adoption of this statement will have no effect on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB recently issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement changes the method of accruing for costs associated with the retirement of fixed assets (e.g. oil & gas production facilities, etc.). It will require that the fair value of the obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset. Implementation of this standard is required no later than January 1, 2003, with earlier application encouraged. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard. REGULATION WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT THE COST, MANNER OR FEASIBILITY OF DOING BUSINESS. Exploration, development, production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include: discharge permits for drilling operations; drilling bonds; reports concerning operations; the spacing of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation. The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final decisions. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on 27 these matters. Some of the FERCs more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the Outer Continental Shelf, or the Shelf, provide open access, non discriminatory service. Historically, the FERC has opted not to impose regulatory requirements under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction. However, the FERC has issued Order No. 639, requiring that virtually all non proprietary pipeline transporters of natural gas on the Shelf report information on their affiliations, rates and conditions of service. These reporting requirements apply, in certain circumstances, to operators of production platforms and other facilities on the Shelf with respect to gas movements across such facilities. In a recent decision, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia permanently enjoined the FERC from enforcing Order No. 639, on the basis that the FERC did not possess the requisite rule making authority under the OCSLA for issuing Order No. 639. The FERCs appeal of the courts decision is pending in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. We cannot predict the outcome of this appeal, nor can we predict what further action the FERC will take with respect to this matter. In addition, the FERC retains authority under OCSLA to exercise jurisdiction over entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction if necessary to ensure non discriminatory access to service on the Shelf. We do not believe that any FERC action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL. Our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are currently not regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers. FEDERAL LEASES. The majority of our U.S. operations are located on federal oil and gas leases, which are administered by the MMS. These leases are issued through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed MMS regulations and orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject to change by the MMS). For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the MMS prior to the commencement of drilling. The MMS has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the Shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. The MMS also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas, and has proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization. Similarly, the MMS has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the MMS may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 28 The MMS has issued a rule that amended its regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases. This rule provides that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases. The lawfulness of the new rule has been challenged in federal court. We cannot predict what action the MMS will take on this matter. We believe that these rules will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION OF DRILLING AND PRODUCTION. We own interests in properties located onshore Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, drilling permits, bonds and reports concerning operations. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing of waste materials, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, imposes regulations on "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA also requires responsible parties to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under OPA and a MMS rule, responsible parties of covered offshore facilities that have a worst case oil spill of more than 1,000 barrels must demonstrate financial assurance in amounts ranging from at least $10 million in state waters to at least $35 million in federal waters, with higher amounts of up to $150 million in certain limited circumstances where the MMS believes the additional coverage is warranted, based on the risk of covered operations or the size of a worst case oil spill. In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. CWA prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to comply with CWA, including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans. OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. 29 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste "drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy," legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes," which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could increase our operating costs, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under the Superfund law may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. These recently acquired onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous state laws, and we potentially could be required to remediate such properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Our foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such foreign requirements pertaining to the environment. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OIL AND GAS PRICES FLUCTUATE WIDELY, AND LOW PRICES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas. These prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are: the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; weather conditions; the price of foreign imports; world wide economic conditions; political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; the level of consumer demand; domestic and foreign governmental regulations; and the price and availability of alternative fuels. 30 OUR USE OF OIL AND GAS PRICE HEDGING CONTRACTS INVOLVES CREDIT RISK AND MAY LIMIT FUTURE REVENUES FROM PRICE INCREASES AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR NET INCOME AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. We use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use may also limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133 on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 generally requires us to record each hedging transaction as an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Each quarter we must record changes in the value of our hedges, which could result in significant fluctuations in net income and stockholders equity from period to period. See Note 3 "Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to our consolidated financial statements. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE THE RESERVES THAT WE PRODUCE. Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. As is generally the case, our producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by steep declines. As a result, we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. We must do this even during periods of low oil and gas prices when it may be difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance these activities. Without successful exploration or acquisition activities, our reserves, production and revenues will decline rapidly. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost. SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO REPLACE AND GROW RESERVES. We make, and will continue to make, substantial expenditures to find, develop, acquire and produce oil and gas reserves. We believe that we will have sufficient cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our credit arrangements to fund planned capital expenditures in 2002. If, however, lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit facility, we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete our drilling program unless we raise additional funds through debt or equity financings. We cannot assure you that debt or equity financing, cash generated by operations or borrowing capacity will be available to meet these requirements. RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND DEPEND ON MANY ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY TURN OUT TO BE INACCURATE. Estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices. Our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties. 31 You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. IF OIL AND GAS PRICES DECREASE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE WRITEDOWNS. There is a risk that we will be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results. We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties. Under the full cost accounting method, the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, using period end oil and gas prices and a 10% discount factor, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. This type of charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities, but it will reduce the book value of our stockholders equity. We review the carrying value of our properties quarterly, based on prices in effect (including the value of our hedge positions) as of the end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results. The carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country by country basis. Therefore, while our properties in one country may be subject to a writedown, our properties in other countries could be unaffected. Once incurred, a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including: recoverable reserves; future oil and gas prices; operating costs; and potential environmental and other liabilities. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We are often not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an "as is" basis. COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS. Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage. Major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies. DRILLING IS A HIGH RISK ACTIVITY. Our future success will depend on the success of our drilling program. In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; 32 equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment. THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS INVOLVES MANY OPERATING RISKS THAT CAN CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES; INSURANCE MAY NOT PROTECT US AGAINST ALL THESE RISKS. These risks include: fires; explosions; blow outs; uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, formation water or drilling fluids; natural disasters; pipe or cement failures; casing collapses; embedded oilfield drilling and service tools; abnormally pressured formations; and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases. If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of: injury or loss of life; severe damage or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment; pollution and other environmental damage; clean up responsibilities; regulatory investigation and penalties; suspension of our operations; and repairs to resume operations. If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected. Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our drilling and development programs and acquisitions, or result in loss of properties. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us. WE HAVE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. We continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in areas where we can use our core competencies. To date, we have expanded our operations to Australia and China. 33 Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the United States is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include: currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of expropriation, nationalization, war or insurrection; increases in taxes and governmental royalties; renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies; changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies; labor problems; and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. EXPLORATION IN DEEPWATER INVOLVES GREATER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RISKS THAN EXPLORATION AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS. THESE RISKS COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. We have developed a three phase strategy to enter the deepwater play. Deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure. We will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs for any deepwater wells we may drill. In addition, much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment, resulting in significant financial and operating risks. OTHER INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANIES LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MAY CHANGE OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS. Many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities. As a result, some of the other working interest owners of our wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. These problems could cause us to change, suspend or terminate our drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION This report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as production targets, anticipated production rates, planned capital expenditures, the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, wells planned to be drilled in the future, our financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services the availability of capital resources and other factors affecting our business described above under the captions "Regulation" and "Other Factors Affecting Our Business." All written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. OIL AND GAS PRICES As independent oil and gas producer, our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of natural gas, crude oil and hydrocarbon condensate. Prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. We utilize and expect to continue to utilize hedging transaction with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow, as well as to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption "Hedging" in Item 7 of this report. INTEREST RATES At December 31, 2001, we had approximately $300 million of outstanding long term debt ($125 million of 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 and $175 million of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011) subject to a fixed rate of interest. Additionally, we had $144 million of convertible trust preferred securities bearing a fixed distribution rate of 6.5%. However, the $129 million outstanding under our reserve based credit facility and money market lines of credit are subject to a rate of interest that fluctuates based on short term interest rates. Because the majority of our long term obligations were at fixed rates, approximately 70% of our total debt at December 31, 2001, we consider our interest rate exposure at such date to be minimal. The impact on annual cash flow of a 25% change (up or down) in the floating rate (approximately 80 basis points) applicable to our borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit would be $1.1 million. At December 31, 2001, we had no open interest rate hedge positions to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES Our cash flow from certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2001. 37
