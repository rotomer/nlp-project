ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. OIL AND GAS PRICES. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production to, among other things, reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. RESERVE REPLACEMENT. As is generally the case, our producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by steep declines. As a result, we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES. We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are: remaining proved oil and gas reserves; timing of our future drilling activities; future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties; allocating the purchase price associated with business combinations; and the valuation of our derivative positions. Please see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results" in this Item 7 for a more detailed discussion of the foregoing matters. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REVENUES. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production and the settlement of hedging contracts associated with our production. Our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices. Revenues for 2002 were 12% lower than 2001 primarily because of lower natural gas prices, a decrease in oil and condensate production and downtime in the Gulf of Mexico associated with Tropical Storm Isidore. The increase in revenues in 2001 when compared to 2000 was primarily due to a 25% increase in production and higher realized natural gas prices. 16 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 PRODUCTION: United States: Natural gas (Bcf)........................................ 144.7 133.2 105.4 Oil and condensate (MBbls)............................... 5,235 5,522 4,090 Total (Bcfe)............................................. 176.1 166.3 130.0 Australia(1): Oil and condensate (MBbls)............................... 1,340 1,476 1,674 Total: Natural gas (Bcf)........................................ 144.7 133.2 105.4 Oil and condensate (MBbls)............................... 6,575 6,998 5,764 Total (Bcfe)............................................. 184.1 175.2 140.0 AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES(2): United States: Natural gas (per Mcf).................................... $ 3.42 $ 4.32 $ 3.56 Oil and condensate (per Bbl)............................. 24.22 24.01 23.33 Australia: Oil and condensate (per Bbl)............................. $26.05 $23.96 $30.08 Total: Natural gas (per Mcf).................................... $ 3.42 $ 4.32 $ 3.56 Oil and condensate (per Bbl)............................. 24.60 24.00 25.29 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe)........................ 3.56 4.25 3.72 (1) Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced. (2) For purposes of this table, average realized prices for natural gas and oil and condensate are presented net of all applicable transportation expenses, which reduced the realized price of natural gas by $0.03, $0.03 and $0.04 for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The realized price of oil and condensate was reduced by $0.28, $0.24 and $0.27 for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Average realized prices include the effects of hedging. PRODUCTION. Our total oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) increased 5% in 2002. Production increased because of acquisitions (including EEX) and successful drilling efforts. These increases were partially offset by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately one Bcf of production in the first quarter of 2002 in response to low prices and by the shut in of four Bcfe in the second half of the year in response to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Gas production in 2001 increased primarily through our acquisition of properties in the Mid Continent, partially offset by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately five Bcfe in the fourth quarter of 2001 in response to low commodity prices. Natural Gas. Our 2002 natural gas production increased nearly 9% when compared to 2001. The increase was the result of successful drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Mid Continent and the acquisition of EEX in late 2002. Partially offsetting this increase was the voluntary curtailment in the first quarter of 2002 in response to low prices and the shut in during the second half of the year related to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Our 2001 natural gas production increased 26% over 2000. About half of the production increase in 2001 came from the Mid Continent acquisition, which closed in January 2001. Our development drilling programs in South Texas and the Gulf of Mexico also were major contributors to our production growth. Gains in production were partially offset by natural declines from other producing properties. Crude Oil and Condensate. Our 2002 oil production decreased about 6% when compared to 2001; primarily reflecting natural field declines in Australia and the U.S. Partially offsetting these declines were increases at High Island 474, Viosca Knoll 738 and other Gulf of Mexico fields. Our crude oil production in 2001 increased 21% over 2000 levels. This increase primarily related to our early 2001 acquisition in the Mid Continent and the success of our drilling efforts, partially offset by natural declines in Australia. 17 EFFECT OF HEDGING ON REALIZED PRICES. The following table presents information about the effect of our hedging program on realized prices. AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES RATIO OF HEDGED TO WITH WITHOUT NON HEDGED HEDGE HEDGE PRICE(1) Natural Gas: Year ended December 31, 2002.......................... $ 3.42 $ 3.17 108% Year ended December 31, 2001.......................... 4.32 4.14 104% Year ended December 31, 2000.......................... 3.56 4.05 88% Crude Oil and Condensate: Year ended December 31, 2002.......................... $24.60 $24.78 99% Year ended December 31, 2001.......................... 24.00 24.17 99% Year ended December 31, 2000.......................... 25.29 29.71 85% (1) The ratio is determined by dividing the realized price (which includes the effects of hedging) by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities. OPERATING EXPENSES. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2002.

Total operating expense inclusive of these charges was $488,245, or $2.65 per Mcfe, for 2002 and $452,536, or $2.58 per Mcfe, for 2001. 18 Our total operating expense for 2002, stated on a unit of production basis, increased 2% over 2001. The increase was primarily related to the following items. Lease operating expense during 2001 included a $5.5 million non recurring expense associated with a workover of a well at South Marsh Island 160. Without the effect of the workover, domestic lease operating expense would have increased 13%, or $0.04 per unit, as a result of several non routine repairs to gathering lines and other offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and a slight increase in well service costs in the Mid Continent. Although our domestic production subject to production taxes increased 14% in 2002, our production tax expense decreased because of a 23% drop in natural gas prices for the year. The increase in our DD&A rate was primarily related to the increased cost of reserve additions. The cost of reserve additions was adversely affected by the quantity of proved reserves added and increases in the cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and facilities construction during the first half of 2001. The increase is partially offset by our fourth quarter 2001 ceiling test writedown of our oil and gas properties. General and administrative expense increased primarily because of a growing domestic workforce and the opening of our office in London, England. Maintenance on our FPSOs resulted in higher Australian lease operating expense during 2001. This $2.1 million decrease from 2001 to 2002 was partially offset on a per unit basis by the 9% decrease in production in 2002. Australian capital expenditures are deductible against production taxes otherwise payable. Production taxes are due on a June 30 fiscal year. We accrue production taxes during the tax fiscal year based on our estimate of revenues and capital expenditures for the fiscal year. The estimate of such taxes for the current year reflects lower actual and anticipated future capital expenditures in Australia. The increase in the Australian DD&A rate during 2002 was primarily a result of our unsuccessful exploratory drilling efforts in 2002 and 2001. The significant increase in Australian general and administrative expense for 2002 relates to costs incurred in connection with the relocation of the previous manager of our Australian operations to our Tulsa, Oklahoma office and the relocation of the current manager of our Australian operations from Houston, Texas to Perth, Australia. On a per unit basis, the increase is magnified by the decline in our production in Australia. 19 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2001.

Total operating expense inclusive of these charges was $452,536, or $2.58 per Mcfe, for 2001 and $304,910, or $2.18 per Mcfe, for 2000. Our total operating expense (exclusive of the ceiling test writedowns in 2000 and 2001) for 2001, stated on a unit of production basis, increased 19% over 2000 because of higher lease operating, production tax, DD&A and G&A expenses. The reasons for these increases are described below. The increased lease operating expense per Mcfe reflected higher oilfield service costs in all our domestic focus areas and relatively higher Australian lease operating expense associated with the operation and maintenance of our two FPSOs. The increase in production and other taxes was primarily related to higher natural gas prices, our expanding onshore Gulf Coast operations and the acquisition of our Mid Continent properties in early 2001. The increase was partly offset by resource rent tax in Australia, which was 33% lower in 2001 compared to 2000 due to unsuccessful drilling efforts. The increase in the domestic DD&A rate was primarily related to lower than expected reserve additions from several wells, increases in the cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and 20 facilities construction and the completion of several higher cost wells. The increase in the Australian DD&A rate was primarily a result of our unsuccessful drilling activities in 2000. The increase on a unit of production basis in G&A expense primarily was due to our growing workforce. Performance based compensation, excluding stock compensation expense, was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter 2001 ceiling test writedown. Performance based compensation, a component of general and administrative expense, was $11.6 million, or $0.07 per Mcfe, in 2001 compared to $12.8 million, or $0.09 per Mcfe, in 2000. WRITEDOWN OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. We did not writedown any of our oil and gas properties in 2002. At December 31, 2002, we had $44.6 million of other international costs that were not subject to amortization. These costs primarily represent our exploration efforts in Chinas Bohai Bay. We continue to appraise the commerciality of our two field discoveries CFD 12 1 and CFD 12 1 South. We have not yet booked any reserves associated with these discoveries. We are not the operator of and do not own a controlling interest in these fields. As a result, we do not control the appraisal and determination of commerciality of these fields. If we determine that one or both of these fields are not commercially viable, we will likely be required to impair the value of our assets in this area. At December 31, 2001, the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling. In accordance with full cost accounting rules, we recorded a domestic ceiling test writedown at December 31, 2001 of $106 million ($68 million after tax). Based on an interim interpretation from the SEC that is applicable to all companies that use the full cost method of accounting, the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations took into account the effects of hedging. This interim interpretation, which is subject to further consideration by the SEC before it is finalized, requires that certain conditions be met in order to take into account the effects of hedging in the calculation of full cost ceiling test impairment, including that the hedges qualify under SFAS 133 and are documented and designated as such and that the policy be applied on a consistent basis whether or not the hedged price is higher than the current market price. The writedown would have been $184 million ($118 million after tax) if we had not used hedge adjusted prices. INTEREST EXPENSE. The following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2002. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 (IN MILLIONS) Gross interest expense.................................... $34.6 $27.9 $14.7 Capitalized interest...................................... (8.8) (8.9) (5.4) Net interest expense...................................... 25.8 19.0 9.3 Distributions on preferred securities..................... 9.3 9.3 9.3 Total interest expense and distributions........ $35.1 $28.3 $18.6 In 2002, interest expense increased in part because of higher debt levels outstanding under our credit arrangements. Interest expense also increased as a result of debt incurred in connection with EEX acquisition in late November 2002. In August 2002, we issued $250 million principal amount of our 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 to finance a portion of the acquisition. Interest that accrued prior to the closing of the acquisition was capitalized as a cost of the transaction. Following the acquisition, EEX retained the obligations associated with its secured notes (which accrue interest at rate of 7.54% per year) and a forward gas sales contract valued at approximately $60 million with an effective interest rate of 9.5% per year. In 2001, total interest expense was higher than 2000 due to borrowings related to our acquisition in the Mid Continent and the issuance of $175 million principal of our 7 5/8% Senior Notes in February 2001. In 2000, our interest expense included interest from borrowings in January 2000 to finance our acquisition of three producing properties in South Texas for $139 million. 21 UNREALIZED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INCOME (EXPENSE). As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001, we are now required to record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The $24.8 million of unrealized income for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily reflects the change in the time value of our open hedging contracts. In 2002, the unrealized expense of $29.1 million represents the settlement of those same hedging contracts and primarily reflects the reversal of the time value gains that were previously recognized during 2001. TAXES. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 33%, 35% and 34%, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2002 was less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to a $3.1 million tax benefit resulting from revised tax legislation enacted in Australia in 2002. The effective tax rate was less than the statutory tax rate in 2000 because the valuation allowance on our Australian net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by $2.3 million primarily as a result of a substantial increase in estimated taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices, estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating and capital costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. Our annual capital budget is established at the beginning of each year. Because of the nature of the properties we own, only a small portion of our capital budget is nondiscretionary. The size of our budget is driven by expected cash flow from operations. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which proved properties are acquired. Based on current commodity prices and our hedges, we currently anticipate that our cash flow will exceed our capital budget (which excludes acquisitions) by more than $100 million in 2003. This excess should allow us to pay down debt and other obligations or repurchase shares of our common stock during the year. CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS. We maintain our reserve based revolving credit facility with Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent. The banks participating in the facility have committed to lend us up to $425 million. The amount available under the facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks holding 75% of the aggregate commitments. The borrowing base is reduced by the principal amount of outstanding senior notes ($300 million at March 14, 2003), 30% of the principal amount of any outstanding senior subordinated notes (a reduction of $75 million at March 14, 2003), the outstanding principal amount of the secured notes ($46 million at March 14, 2003) and an agreed valuation for the gas sales obligation ($72.5 million at March 14, 2003). The borrowing base will be redetermined at least semi annually and, after reduction for the foregoing items, was $236.5 million at March 14, 2003. No assurances can be given that the banks will not elect to redetermine the borrowing base in the future. The facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions. The facility matures on January 23, 2004. We expect to complete an amendment of the facility during the first quarter of 2003 that would extend the maturity to January 23, 2005. We also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount limited by our credit facility to $40 million. At March 14, 2003, we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $130 million and outstanding borrowings under our money market lines of $4 million. Consequently, at March 14, 2003, we had approximately $142.5 million of available capacity under our credit arrangements. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the interest rate was 2.737% and 3.25%, respectively, for LIBOR based loans under our credit facility and 2.615% and 3.00%, respectively, for the loans outstanding under our money market lines of credit. 22 WORKING CAPITAL. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements. Generally, we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements. As a result, we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. We had a working capital deficit of $57.0 million as of December 31, 2002. This compares to a working capital surplus of $65.6 million at the end of 2001 and $38.5 million at the end of 2000. Our 2002 working capital deficit included an $11.2 million note payment due January 2003 and accrued severance costs associated with the EEX acquisition. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. Our net cash flows from operations in 2002 declined 20% when compared to 2001. The decrease is primarily due to lower gas prices and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher production volumes. Our net cash flows from operations were $502.4 million in 2001 and $316.4 million in 2000. The increase in 2001 over 2000 is primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and increased production volumes, offset by increased operating expenses. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. Our 2002 capital spending was $908 million, a 6% increase over the previous year. The largest component of our capital spending was the $571 million EEX acquisition. In 2002, we also invested $150 in U.S. development, $106 million in domestic exploration, $53 million in other domestic acquisitions and $28 million internationally. In 2001, our capital spending totaled $855 million, including $435 million in acquisitions. The largest component of acquisition spending was our first quarter acquisition in the Mid Continent. In 2001, we invested $302 million in development, $97 million in domestic exploration and $21 million internationally. Total spending in 2000 was $379 million. Our 2000 capital spending program included $139 million for acquisitions, $129 million for development, $91 million for domestic exploration and $20 million for international activities. We budgeted $450 million for capital spending, excluding uncompleted acquisitions, in 2003. We expect that 55 60% of this budget will be invested in the Gulf of Mexico (including deepwater), 35 40% in onshore U.S. and the balance in international projects. We anticipate that our capital expenditure budget for 2003 will be funded from cash flow from operations. To the extent that cash receipts during the year are slower than capital needs, we will make up the short fall with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including the extent to which proved properties are acquired, drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing, size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable. Historically, we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year. Depending on the timing of an acquisition, we may spend additional capital during the year of acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties. 23 CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The table below summarizes our significant contractual cash payment obligations and commitments, other than hedging contracts, by maturity as of December 31, 2002. Hedging contracts are excluded because they are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors. See "Hedging" below.

(3) See Note 16, "Commitment and Contingencies Lease Commitments," to our consolidated financial statements. CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements" in this Item 7 for a description of our bank revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. SENIOR NOTES. In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 priced (at 99.931% of par) with a yield to maturity of 7.635%. Net proceeds from the offering of $173.1 million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility incurred in connection with our January 2001 Mid Continent acquisition. In October 1997, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. Our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by certain liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. 24 The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES. On August 13, 2002, we sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 priced with a yield to maturity of 8.50%. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $241.8 million were used to repay EEX debt that became due at the closing of the acquisition and to pay transaction costs. Interest on the notes is payable semi annually. Interest accruing prior to the closing of the EEX acquisition was capitalized as a cost of the transaction. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after August 15, 2007 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes. Prior to August 15, 2007, we may redeem all but not part of the notes at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, before August 15, 2005, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 108.375% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; make certain dispositions of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets. SECURED NOTES. In the second quarter of 2001, EEX assumed the obligations under the secured notes in connection with the termination of two leveraged leasing arrangements. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.54% per year and are secured by the floating production system and pipelines described in Note 4, "Oil and Gas Assets Assets Held for Sale," to our consolidated financial statements. Redemption of the notes prior to 2006 may require us to pay make whole premiums. Principal is payable in annual installments on January 2 of each year (except 2006) with the final installment due in 2009. The following is a summary of principal amounts by year of maturity at December 31, 2002 (in thousands): 2003........................................................ $ 11,215 2004........................................................ 12,093 2005........................................................ 11,366 2006........................................................ 2007........................................................ 12,067 Thereafter.................................................. 30,437 Total secured notes....................................... $ 77,178 Less current maturities..................................... (11,215) Total long term secured notes............................. $ 65,963 25 GAS SALES OBLIGATION. In 1999, EEX entered into a gas forward sales contract with Bob West Treasure L.L.C. (BWT), an affiliate of Enron Corporation,. Pursuant to the gas sales contract, EEX committed to deliver approximately 50 Bcfe of production to BWT in exchange for proceeds of $105 million. BWT receives an adjusted market price as the volumes are delivered. EEX also has an obligation to market the delivered volumes of gas for BWT. Under the terms of the gas sales contract, EEX is required to make a cash payment if the committed gas volumes are not delivered. Additionally, BWT holds liens on certain of EEXs oil and gas properties as security if the committed gas volumes are not delivered or the cash payments are not made. Payments under the gas sales contract are amortized as the underlying gas is delivered under the interest method using an interest rate of 9.5%. As of December 31, 2002, the unamortized balance was approximately $60 million and the fair value of the remaining obligation was approximately $64.5 million. The interest portion of the payment is included as a component of interest expense in our consolidated income statement. EEX also guaranteed BWTs performance under certain swap agreements between BWT and Enron entered into concurrently with the gas sales contract. If BWT fails to make payments under the swap agreements, EEX must perform under the guarantee by paying Enron on BWTs behalf. The maximum amount that EEX could be required to pay under this guarantee is not determinable and would depend on the settlement value of the swaps at the time of any BWT default. BWT, which is outside of the Enron bankruptcy proceedings, continues to meet its contractual obligations under its swap agreements and, therefore, EEX has not been required to perform under this guarantee. On March 6, 2003, we reached an agreement with BWT, certain lenders and insurers of BWT and the unsecured creditors committee of Enron to terminate EEXs gas sales contract. The agreement, which is subject to the final approval of the Enron bankruptcy court, provides for the termination of the gas sales contract, the swaps entered into in connection with the gas sales contract and any other agreements between EEX, BWT and Enron related to the gas sales contract, including the guarantee and all liens and other security interests on EEXs properties, in exchange for a payment to BWT representing: the remaining unamortized obligation under the gas sales contract; the fair market value of the swaps; an agreed upon value of $0.5 million for BWTs limited membership interest in an EEX subsidiary that BWT acquired in conjunction with the gas sales contract. CONVERTIBLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. In August 1999, a subsidiary of our company that is a Delaware business trust issued $143.75 million (2.875 million securities having a liquidation preference of $50 each) of 6.5% Cumulative Quarterly Income Convertible Preferred Securities, Series A. The proceeds from the issuance of these securities (commonly referred to as trust preferred securities) were used to purchase $143.75 million of our companys 6.5% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2029. The interest terms and payment dates of the debentures correspond to the distribution terms of the trust preferred securities. The debentures are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly in arrears at a rate of 6.5% per annum on the stated liquidation of the securities. The trust preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into our common stock at the rate of 1.3646 shares of our common stock per trust preferred security the equivalent of a conversion price of $36.64 per share of our common stock. The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures in August 2029, and on a proportionate basis to the extent of any earlier redemption of the debentures by us. The debentures are redeemable by us at any time. For a more detailed description of the trust preferred securities, see Note 9, "Convertible Preferred Securities of Newfield Financial Trust I," to our consolidated financial statements. 26 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On May 4, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $50 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2001, we had purchased 823,000 shares for total consideration of $24.7 million at an average of $29.97 per share. During 2002, no shares were purchased under this program. In February 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $50 million from that date forward to repurchase shares of our common stock. As a result, additional repurchases may be effected from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately negotiated transactions. No limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program. Subject to applicable securities laws, purchases will be at times and in amounts, as we deem appropriate. As of February 28, 2003, no shares had been purchased during the first quarter of 2003. HEDGING We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 18 24 months as part of our risk management program. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and return on some of our acquisitions. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Approximately 84% of our 2002 production was subject to hedge positions. In 2001, 68% of our production was subject to hedge positions, compared to 45% in 2000. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2002, Bank of Montreal, Morgan Stanley and J Aron & Company were the counterparties with respect to 61% of our future hedged production. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Please see the discussion in Note 5, "Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this report. 27 NATURAL GAS. As of December 31, 2002, we held the commodity derivative instruments set forth in the table below as cash flow hedges of the forecasted sale of our U.S. natural gas production for 2003 through 2005. This table includes hedges that were entered into by EEX prior to its acquisition.

The addition of these hedges, along with those already in place, resulted in approximately 77% of our 2003 forecasted natural gas production being hedged. We continue to evaluate additional hedging transactions.

OIL AND CONDENSATE. As of December 31, 2002, we held the commodity derivative instruments set forth in the table below as cash flow hedges of the forecasted sale of our U.S. Gulf Coast oil production for 2003 through 2005.

The actual cash price we receive, however, generally is about $2.00 per barrel less than the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate price when adjusted for location and quality differences. Our Australian production is not hedged. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. The estimated fair value of these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. The accuracy of our estimates and assumptions are sensitive to material changes in the future due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into three categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES UNDER THE FULL COST METHOD. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: remaining proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS regarding the allocation of the purchase price. ACCOUNTING FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES REQUIRES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS regarding the valuation of hedge positions. OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods for accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. FULL COST METHOD. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are directly related to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development also are capitalized. Costs associated with production and general corporate 30 activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and oil prices decline, even if for only a short period of time, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The future net revenues associated with our estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. Based on an interim interpretation from the SEC, the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations may take into consideration the effects of hedging if certain conditions are met. See "Results of Operations Writedown of Oil and Gas Properties" in this Item 7. COSTS WITHHELD FROM AMORTIZATION. Unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage, unamortized seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment 31 requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $269 million of costs excluded from our amortization base. Because the application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2002 resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base, without adding any associated reserves, would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. However, our future depletion rate will increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND ABANDONMENT COSTS. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our offshore production platforms, FPSOs, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically occur many years in the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technologies and the future political and regulatory environment. ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS As part of our growth strategy, we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we would be required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but must be evaluated periodically for impairment. We have not recorded goodwill in connection with any of our previous acquisitions. HEDGING ACTIVITIES Beginning in 2001, the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We have elected to designate all of our derivative instruments as hedges against the price we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Because our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, to the extent that changes in their fair values offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold. To the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the change is recorded in income in the period it occurs. VALUATION OF HEDGE POSITIONS. In determining the amounts to be recorded, we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location. Where necessary, we adjust NYMEX prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices. Our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of the Black Scholes option pricing model. The estimated future prices are 32 compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent third parties quotations. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations". This statement changes the method of accounting for costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets (e.g. oil & gas production facilities, etc.) that we are obligated to incur. The statement requires that the fair value of the obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the asset retirement cost be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the associated asset. Under our previous accounting method, we recognized the cost to abandon our oil and gas properties over their productive lives on a unit of production basis. We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. A pre tax cumulative effect gain of approximately $8 million will be reported in our consolidated statement of income on January 1, 2003. We will also report an increase in our assets of approximately $160 million and an increase in our liabilities of approximately $152 million. There will be no impact on our reported cash flows as a result of adopting SFAS No. 143. In the second quarter of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Recision of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002." This statement provides guidance for income statement classifications of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions. Our adoption of SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on our financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Our adoption of SFAS 146 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on our financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of accounting for entities that elect to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation to the fair value method. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We adopted the disclosure provisions of this statement in our 2002 year end financial statements. We continue to apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for our stock based compensation plans. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value, which is different from the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." FIN 45 has a dual effective date. The initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of FIN No. 45 to have a material effect on our financial statements. See Note 7, "Debt Gas Sales Obligation," to our consolidated financial statements, regarding the guarantee associated with the Gas Sales Obligation. 33 In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51." The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights (these entities are referred to as "variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and how to determine if business enterprise should consolidate the VIE. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either (1) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46 requires that all enterprises with a significant variable interest in a VIE make additional disclosures regarding their relationship with the VIE. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 46 on our financial statements; however we do not believe that we have any VIEs that will require consolidation in our financial statements under this interpretation. REGULATION WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT THE COST, MANNER OR FEASIBILITY OF DOING BUSINESS. Exploration, development, production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include: discharge permits for drilling operations; drilling bonds; reports concerning operations; the spacing of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation. The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final decisions. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on 34 these matters. Some of the FERCs more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the Outer Continental Shelf, or the Shelf, provide open access, non discriminatory service. Historically, the FERC has opted not to impose regulatory requirements under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction. However, the FERC has issued Order No. 639, requiring that virtually all non proprietary pipeline transporters of natural gas on the Shelf report information on their affiliations, rates and conditions of service. These reporting requirements apply, in certain circumstances, to operators of production platforms and other facilities on the Shelf with respect to gas movements across such facilities. In a recent decision, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia permanently enjoined the FERC from enforcing Order No. 639, on the basis that the FERC did not possess the requisite rule making authority under the OCSLA for issuing Order No. 639. The FERCs appeal of the courts decision is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. We cannot predict the outcome of this appeal, nor can we predict what further action the FERC will take with respect to this matter. In addition, the FERC retains authority under OCSLA to exercise jurisdiction over entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction if necessary to ensure non discriminatory access to service on the Shelf. We do not believe that any FERC action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL. Our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers. FEDERAL LEASES. The majority of our U.S. operations are located on federal oil and gas leases, which are administered by the MMS. These leases are issued through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed MMS regulations and orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject to change by the MMS). For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the MMS prior to the commencement of drilling. The MMS has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the Shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. The MMS also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas, and has proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization. Similarly, the MMS has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the MMS may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 35 The MMS has issued a final rule that governs the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases. This rule provides that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases. The lawfulness of the new rule has been challenged in federal court. We cannot predict what action the MMS will take on this matter. We believe that these rules will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION OF DRILLING AND PRODUCTION. We own interests in properties located onshore Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilling and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the obligation to perform investigatory or remedial activities or the imposition of injunctive relief. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, imposes regulations on "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate to the MMS that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for certain costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and MMS regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters. Since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters, we currently provide a total of $150 million in financial assurance to MMS. This $150 million in financial assurance is provided through $35 million in guaranteed net worth and $115 million in insurance. In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. CWA prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to comply with CWA, including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans. 36 OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste "drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy," legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes," which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could increase our operating costs, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under the Superfund law may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous state laws, and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Our foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such foreign requirements pertaining to the environment. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OIL AND GAS PRICES FLUCTUATE WIDELY, AND LOW PRICES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas. These prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce. Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are: the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the price and availability of alternative fuels; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; 37 the price of foreign imports; world wide economic conditions; political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and domestic and foreign governmental regulations. OUR USE OF OIL AND GAS PRICE HEDGING CONTRACTS INVOLVES CREDIT RISK AND MAY LIMIT FUTURE REVENUES FROM PRICE INCREASES AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR NET INCOME. We use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use may also limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND, DEVELOP AND ACQUIRE OIL AND GAS RESERVES. As is generally the case, our producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by steep declines. To maintain production levels, we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production. Without successful exploration or acquisition activities, our reserves, production and revenues will decline rapidly. We may be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost. In addition, substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves. If lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit arrangements, we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves. ACTUAL QUANTITIES OF RECOVERABLE OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE RESERVES MOST LIKELY WILL VARY FROM OUR ESTIMATES. Estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates. Actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices. Our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. IF OIL AND GAS PRICES DECREASE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE WRITEDOWNS. We may be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results. 38 We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, using period end oil and gas prices and a 10% discount factor, plus the lower of cost or fair market value for unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. We review the carrying value of our properties quarterly, based on prices in effect (including the value of our hedge positions) as of the end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results. The carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country by country basis. Therefore, while our properties in one country may be subject to a writedown, our properties in other countries could be unaffected. Once incurred, a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including: recoverable reserves; future oil and gas prices; operating costs; and potential environmental and other liabilities. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an "as is" basis. COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS. Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage. Major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies. DRILLING IS A HIGH RISK ACTIVITY. Our future success will depend on the success of our drilling program. In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment. 39 THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS INVOLVES MANY OPERATING RISKS THAT CAN CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES; INSURANCE MAY NOT PROTECT US AGAINST ALL THESE RISKS. These risks include: fires; explosions; blow outs; uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, formation water or drilling fluids; natural disasters; pipe or cement failures; casing collapses; embedded oilfield drilling and service tools; abnormally pressured formations; and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases. If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of: injury or loss of life; severe damage or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment; pollution and other environmental damage; investigatory and clean up responsibilities; regulatory investigation and penalties; suspension of our operations; and repairs to resume operations. If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected. Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions, or result in loss of properties. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us. WE HAVE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. We currently have international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in select areas. Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the United States is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include: currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of expropriation, nationalization, war or insurrection; increases in taxes and governmental royalties; renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies; 40 changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies; labor problems; and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. EXPLORATION IN DEEPWATER INVOLVES GREATER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RISKS THAN EXPLORATION AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS. These risks could result in substantial losses. Deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure. We will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs for any deepwater wells that we drill. In addition, much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment, resulting in significant financial and operating risks. In addition, as we carry out our drilling program is deepwater, it is likely that we will not initially serve as operator of the wells. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. The success and timing of drilling and exploitation activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including: the timing and amount of capital expenditures; the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel; the operators expertise and financial resources; approval of other participants in drilling wells; and selection of technology. OTHER INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANIES LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MAY CHANGE OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS. Many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities. As a result, some of the other working interest owners of our wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. These problems could cause us to change, suspend or terminate our drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION This report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures, the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, wells planned to be drilled in the future, our financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services the availability of capital resources and other factors affecting our business described above under the captions "Regulation" and "Other Factors Affecting Our Business." All written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. 41 COMMONLY USED OIL AND GAS TERMS Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and gas business.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. OIL AND GAS PRICES We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 18 24 months as part of our risk management program. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and return on some of our acquisitions. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption "Hedging" in Item 7 of this report. INTEREST RATES At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $616 million in long term fixed rate debt. This debt was comprised of: $125 million of 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007; $175 million of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011; $250 million of 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012; and $66 million of secured notes with an interest rate of 7.54%. Additionally, we had $144 million of convertible trust preferred securities bearing a fixed distribution rate of 6.5%. At December 31, 2002, we also had $60 million remaining on a gas sales obligation that we assumed with the purchase of EEX. Payment under this obligation is amortized on the interest method using an interest rate of 9.5%. Our year end 2002 variable rate debt consisted of $28 million borrowed under our bank revolving credit facility and $8 million borrowed under our money market lines of credit. The interest rate at December 31, 2002 for our LIBOR based loans under our credit facility was 2.737% and the interest rate for the money market lines was 2.615%. We considered our interest rate exposure at year end 2002 to be minimal because the majority, about 86%, of our long term debt obligations were at fixed rates. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10% change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be $0.1 million. At December 31, 2002, we had no open interest rate hedge positions to affect our exposure to changes in interest rates. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES Our cash flow from certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2002. 44
