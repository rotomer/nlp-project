ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. Our areas of operation include the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins, Chinas Bohai Bay and the North Sea. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. OIL AND GAS PRICES. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production to, among other things, reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. RESERVE REPLACEMENT. Generally, our producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by steep declines. As a result, we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES. We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are: remaining proved oil and gas reserves; timing of our future drilling, development and abandonment activities; future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties; allocating the purchase price associated with business combinations; and the valuation of our derivative positions. Please see "Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results" in this Item 7 for a more detailed discussion of a number of other factors that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On September 5, 2003, we sold our wholly owned subsidiary, Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd., which held all of our Australian assets. As a result of the sale, the historical results of operations of Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd. are reflected on our consolidated financial statements as "discontinued operations." Please see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations," to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report. Except where noted, discussions in this report relate to our continuing activities. REVENUES. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production and the settlement of hedging contracts associated with our production. Our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and or production volumes. Revenues for 2003 reached a record 17 $1.0 billion, and were 62% higher than 2002 revenues primarily because of higher natural gas and crude oil prices and a 25% increase in production. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 PRODUCTION: Natural gas (Bcf)........................................ 184.2 144.7 133.2 Oil and condensate (MBbls)............................... 6,054 5,235 5,522 Total (Bcfe)............................................. 220.6 176.1 166.3 AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES(1): Natural gas (per Mcf).................................... $ 4.58 $ 3.42 $ 4.32 Oil and condensate (per Bbl)............................. 27.65 24.21 24.01 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe)........................ 4.58 3.53 4.26 (1) For purposes of this table, average realized prices for natural gas and oil and condensate are presented net of all applicable transportation expenses, which reduced the realized price of natural gas by $0.02, $0.03 and $0.03 for the years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The realized price of oil and condensate was reduced by $0.34, $0.35 and $0.31 for the years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Average realized prices include the effects of hedging. PRODUCTION. Our total oil and gas production in 2003 (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) increased 25% over 2002 levels. Production increased primarily because of the acquisition of EEX in November 2002 and other small acquisitions and successful drilling efforts in 2003. In addition, 2002 production was reduced by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately one Bcfe of production in the first quarter of that year in response to low commodity prices and by the shut in of four Bcfe of production in the second half of that year in response to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Our 2002 total oil and gas production increased 6% over 2001 primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Mid Continent and the acquisition of EEX. These increases were partially offset by our voluntary curtailment and the weather related shut ins described above. NATURAL GAS. Our 2003 natural gas production increased 27% when compared to 2002. The increase primarily was the result of the EEX acquisition in November 2002. Our development drilling programs in South Texas, the Mid Continent and the Gulf of Mexico also were major contributors to our production growth. In addition, 2002 production was reduced by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately one Bcfe of production in the first quarter of that year in response to low commodity prices and by the shut in of four Bcfe of production in the second half of that year in response to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Our 2002 natural gas production was nearly 9% higher than 2001 levels. The increase was the result of successful drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Mid Continent and the acquisition of EEX in November 2002. Partially offsetting this increase was our voluntary curtailment and the weather related shut ins described above. CRUDE OIL AND CONDENSATE. Our 2003 oil and condensate production increased 16% when compared to 2002 levels. Development drilling programs in the U.S. and the acquisition of EEX in November 2002 were partially offset by natural field declines in all producing regions. Our 2002 oil production decreased about 6% when compared to 2001 primarily reflecting natural field declines in the U.S. 18 EFFECT OF HEDGING ON REALIZED PRICES. The following table presents information about the effect of our hedging program on realized prices. AVERAGE REALIZED PRICES RATIO OF HEDGED TO WITH WITHOUT NON HEDGED HEDGE HEDGE PRICE(1) Natural Gas: Year ended December 31, 2003.......................... $ 4.58 $ 5.13 89% Year ended December 31, 2002.......................... 3.42 3.17 108% Year ended December 31, 2001.......................... 4.32 4.14 104% Crude Oil and Condensate: Year ended December 31, 2003.......................... $27.65 $29.77 93% Year ended December 31, 2002.......................... 24.21 24.45 99% Year ended December 31, 2001.......................... 24.01 24.23 99% (1) The ratio is determined by dividing the realized price (which includes the effects of hedging) by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities. OPERATING EXPENSES. We are a growth oriented company. As such, our proved reserves and production have grown steadily since our founding. Naturally, our operating expenses have increased with our growth. As a result, we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from one period to another is on a unit of production, or Mcfe, basis. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2003. UNIT OF PRODUCTION AMOUNT (PER MCFE) (IN THOUSANDS) YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, PERCENTAGE DECEMBER 31, PERCENTAGE INCREASE INCREASE 2003 2002 (DECREASE) 2003 2002 (DECREASE) Lease operating..................... $0.54 $0.52 4% $119,290 $ 90,768 31% Production and other taxes.......... 0.14 0.08 75% 31,737 13,285 139% Transportation...................... 0.03 0.03 6,359 5,708 11% Depreciation, depletion and amortization...................... 1.79 1.68 7% 394,701 295,054 34% General and administrative (exclusive of stock compensation)(1).................. 0.27 0.29 (7%) 58,577 51,562 14% Total operating(1)............. 2.77 2.60 7% 610,664 456,377 34% (1) Stock compensation charges were $3,059, or $0.01 per Mcfe, for 2003 and $2,801, or $0.02 per Mcfe, for 2002. Total operating expense, inclusive of these charges but excluding the gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of our trust preferred securities, was $613,723, or $2.78 per Mcfe, for 2003 and $459,178, or $2.61 per Mcfe, for 2002. Our total operating expense (excluding stock compensation) for 2003, stated on a unit of production basis, increased 7% over 2002. The increase was primarily related to the following items. Lease operating expense (LOE) on a unit of production basis for 2003 increased 4% over the same period of last year in large part due to the addition of higher cost onshore properties through the EEX acquisition and a higher level of workover activity in 2003. Production taxes on a unit of production basis increased 75% in 2003 due to higher commodity prices when compared to the prior year. Additionally, a greater percentage of our production is now onshore and subject to production taxes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (excluding furniture, fixtures and equipment) for 2003 was $1.76 per Mcfe versus $1.66 per Mcfe for 2002. Our adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 19 2003 (see " Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Adoption of SFAS No. 143") resulted in $0.03 per Mcfe of the increase. The remainder of the increase resulted from the increased cost of reserve additions during the year. General and administrative expense (G&A) for 2003, before stock compensation expense and capitalized direct internal costs, on a unit of production basis, increased $0.05 per Mcfe or 16%, as compared to the same period of 2002. This increase is primarily due to increased salaries and benefits related to an increase in the number of employees due to growth of the company, a payment made to employees located in EEXs San Antonio, Texas office upon the closing of the office in June 2003, and an increase in incentive compensation expense due to the significant increase in 2003 earnings. This increase was offset by an increase in capitalized direct internal costs. During 2003, we capitalized $26.7 million of direct internal costs, compared to $7.0 million in 2002. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2002. UNIT OF PRODUCTION AMOUNT (PER MCFE) (IN THOUSANDS) YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, PERCENTAGE DECEMBER 31, PERCENTAGE INCREASE INCREASE 2002 2001 (DECREASE) 2002 2001 (DECREASE) Lease operating..................... $0.52 $0.52 $ 90,768 $ 85,683 6% Production and other taxes.......... 0.08 0.09 (11%) 13,285 14,424 (8%) Transportation...................... 0.03 0.03 5,708 5,569 2% Depreciation, depletion and amortization...................... 1.68 1.65 2% 295,054 274,893 7% General and administrative (exclusive of stock compensation)(1).................. 0.29 0.24 21% 51,562 39,870 29% Total operating(1)............. 2.60 2.53 3% 456,377 420,439 9% (1) Stock compensation charges were $2,801, or $0.02 per Mcfe, for 2002, and $2,751, or $0.02 per Mcfe, for 2001. Total operating expense, inclusive of these charges but excluding the ceiling test writedown, was $459,178, or $2.61 per Mcfe, for 2002 and $423,190, or $2.54 per Mcfe, for 2001. Our total operating expense for 2002 (excluding stock compensation), stated on a unit of production basis, increased 3% over 2001. The increase was primarily related to the following items. Lease operating expense on a unit of production basis for 2002 remained flat compared to the same period of 2001. The earlier period included a $5.5 million non recurring expense associated with a workover of a well at South Marsh Island 160. Without the effect of the workover, lease operating expense for 2002 would have increased 13%, or $0.04 per unit, as a result of several non routine repairs to gathering lines and other offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and a slight increase in well service costs in the Mid Continent. Although our production subject to production taxes increased 14% in 2002, our production tax expense decreased because of a 21% drop in natural gas prices for the year. The increase in our DD&A rate was primarily related to the increased cost of reserve additions. The cost of reserve additions was adversely affected by the quantity of proved reserves added and increases in the cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and facilities construction during the first half of 2001. The increase is partially offset by our fourth quarter 2001 ceiling test writedown of our oil and gas properties. General and administrative expense increased primarily because of a growing domestic workforce and the opening of our office in London, England. During 2002, we capitalized $7.0 million of direct internal costs, compared to $5.3 million in 2001. 20 WRITEDOWN OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. We did not writedown any of our oil and gas properties in 2003 or 2002. At December 31, 2001, the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling. In accordance with full cost accounting rules, we recorded a domestic ceiling test writedown at December 31, 2001 of $106 million ($68 million after tax). The full cost ceiling test impairment calculations took into account the effects of hedging. The writedown would have been $184 million ($118 million after tax) if we had not used hedge adjusted prices for the volumes that were subject to hedges. GAS SALES OBLIGATION SETTLEMENT. Pursuant to a gas forward sales contract entered into in 1999, EEX committed to deliver approximately 50 Bcf of production to Bob West Treasure L.L.C. (BWT) in exchange for proceeds of $105 million. As of the date of our acquisition of EEX, we recorded a liability of approximately $62 million, which represented the then current market value of approximately 16 Bcf of reserves remaining under the gas sales contact. We accounted for the obligation under the gas sales contract as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. On March 31, 2003, pursuant to a settlement agreement with BWT and the other parties to related transactions, the gas sales contract, the swaps entered into by BWT in connection with the gas sales contract and all other agreements related to the gas sales contract, including the guarantee and all liens and other security interests on EEXs properties, were terminated in exchange for a payment by us of approximately $73 million. This payment represented: the remaining unamortized obligation under the gas sales obligation; the fair market value of swaps entered into by BWT in conjunction with the gas sales contract; various transactions fees related to the termination; and an agreed upon value for BWTs membership interest in an EEX subsidiary. In connection with the settlement, we recognized a loss of $10 million under the caption "Gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities" on our consolidated statement of income. REDEMPTION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. We redeemed all of the outstanding 6 1/2% Cumulative Quarterly Income Convertible Preferred Securities of Newfield Financial Trust I on June 27, 2003 for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $148.4 million, or $38.31 on a per share of underlying common stock basis (excluding in each case accrued but unpaid distributions). The holders of only a small number of the securities elected to convert their securities into shares of our common stock prior to the redemption date (a total of 48,076 shares of common stock were issued). Included in the aggregate redemption price is $6.5 million of optional redemption premium. Upon redemption, this premium and $4.0 million of unamortized offering costs (which were being amortized over the 30 year life of the securities) were expensed under the caption "Gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities" on our consolidated statement of income. We financed the redemption with the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of 3.5 million shares of our common stock on May 27, 2003 (approximately $131.2 million, or $37.49 per share) and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. INTEREST EXPENSE. The following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2003. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 (IN MILLIONS) Gross interest expense...................................... $ 57.8 $34.5 $27.9 Capitalized interest........................................ (15.9) (8.8) (8.9) Net interest expense........................................ 41.9 25.7 19.0 Distributions on preferred securities....................... 4.6 9.3 9.3 Total interest expense and distributions.................. $ 46.5 $35.0 $28.3 21 Our interest expense increased in both 2003 and 2002 as compared to the prior year because of higher debt levels outstanding under our credit arrangements and the issuance of our $250 million principal amount 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 in August 2002, the net proceeds of which were used to repay EEX debt that came due at the closing of the acquisition in November 2002 and transaction costs associated with the acquisition. Because the proceeds were held in escrow pending closing, interest that accrued prior to the closing (approximately $1.6 million) was capitalized as a cost of the transaction. We also assumed $162.4 million of EEX obligations $100.8 million principal amount of secured notes and $61.6 million under a forward gas sales contract that remained outstanding following the closing. The secured notes accrued interest at a rate of 7.54% per year and the forward gas sales contract had an effective interest rate of 9.5% per year. In December 2002, we repurchased $23.6 million principal amount of the secured notes. During 2003, we repurchased or repaid $74.3 million principal amount of the secured notes. Premiums paid to the holders of the repurchased notes of $3.9 million were charged to interest expense in 2003. We also settled the forward gas sales contract in March 2003. The repurchase of secured notes and the settlement of the gas sales obligation were financed with borrowings under our credit arrangements. See Note 8, "Debt Secured Notes and Gas Sales Obligation Settlement," to our consolidated financial statements. Capitalized interest increased during 2003 because of our increased unproved property base resulting from the EEX acquisition. Distributions on preferred securities decreased in 2003 due to the redemption of our trust preferred securities in June 2003. See Note 10, "Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities," to our consolidated financial statements. COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INCOME (EXPENSE). As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001, we are now required to record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The unrealized expense of $6.1 million for the year ended 2003 primarily represents the hedge ineffectiveness associated with our hedging program ($1.1 million) and the fair value adjustment for our three way collar contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting ($5.0 million). The unrealized expense of $29.1 million in 2002 primarily reflects the reversal of the time value gains that were previously recognized during 2001. The $24.8 million of unrealized income for the year ended 2001 primarily reflects the change in the time value of our open hedging contracts. For a further description of these items, please see Note 6, "Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this Form 10 K. TAXES. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 36%. The effective tax rate for all three years was more than the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the state income taxes associated with applicable income from various states. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143. We adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," as of January 1, 2003. This statement changes the method of accounting for expected future costs associated with our obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities and plug and abandon wells. Prior to January 1, 2003, we recognized the undiscounted estimated cost to abandon our oil and gas properties over their estimated productive lives on a unit of production basis as a component of DD&A expense and no liability or capitalized costs associated with such abandonment were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. SFAS No. 143 requires that, if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of an abandonment obligation can be made, a liability (an "asset retirement obligation" or "ARO") will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the asset retirement cost will be capitalized in oil and gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred. In general, the amount of an ARO and the costs capitalized will be equal to the estimated future cost to satisfy the abandonment obligation using current prices that are escalated by an assumed inflation factor after discounting the future cost back to the date that the abandonment obligation was incurred using an assumed cost of funds for our company. After recording these amounts, the ARO will be accreted to its future estimated value using the same assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs will be depreciated on a unit of production basis over the productive life of the related properties. Both the accretion and the depreciation are included in DD&A expense on our consolidated statement of income. 22 At adoption of SFAS No. 143, a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was required in order to recognize: an initial ARO as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet; an increase in oil and gas properties for the cost to abandon our oil and gas properties; cumulative accretion of the ARO from the period incurred up to the January 1, 2003 adoption date; and cumulative depreciation on the additional capitalized costs included in oil and gas properties up to the January 1, 2003 adoption date. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded a $134.8 million increase in the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and an initial ARO of $128.5 million. Additionally, we recognized an after tax gain of $5.6 million (the after tax amount by which additional capitalized costs, net of accumulated depreciation, exceeded the initial ARO, including in each case discontinued operations) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On September 5, 2003, we sold our wholly owned subsidiary, Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd., which held all of our Australian assets. As a result of the sale, the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flow of Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd. are reflected in our financial statements as "discontinued operations." Please see Note 2, "Discontinued Operations," to our consolidated financial statements. The results of operations of Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd., which have been reclassified as discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized as follows: TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 2002 2001 (IN THOUSANDS) Revenues............................................. $ 15,485 $ 34,915 $ 35,353 Operating expenses................................... (21,888) (29,068) (29,347) Income (loss) from operations........................ (6,403) 5,847 6,006 Other income (expense)............................... (3,478) (2,940) 3,273 Income (loss) before income taxes.................... (9,881) 2,907 9,279 Income tax (provision) benefit....................... 2,784 2,194 (2,885) Income (loss) from operations........................ (7,097) 5,101 6,394 Loss on sale......................................... (9,895) Income (loss) from discontinued operations........... $(16,992) $ 5,101 $ 6,394 The decrease in earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 was primarily due to the loss on sale of Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd. of $9.9 million, a ceiling test writedown of $7.3 million ($5.1 million after tax) recorded in the second quarter of 2003 and the timing of oil liftings from our FPSOs in 2003 as compared to 2002. The decrease in earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 was due to the timing of oil liftings from our FPSOs in 2002 as compared to 2001 and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. This decrease was offset by a $3.1 million tax benefit resulting from revised tax legislation enacted in Australia in 2002. 23 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our capital budget is established at the beginning of each year. Because of the nature of the properties we own, only a small portion of our capital budget is nondiscretionary. The size of our budget is driven by expected cash flow from operations. Based on current commodity prices and the high percentage of our anticipated 2004 production that has been hedged, we currently anticipate that our cash flow will exceed our capital budget (which excludes acquisitions) by more than $100 million in 2004. This excess should allow us to pay down debt and other obligations during the year, unless we increase our capital budget. Our cash flow from operations during 2003 exceeded our capital expenditures (including the acquisition of Primary Natural Resources) during that period. We used the excess cash flow to pay down debt (see " Credit Arrangements" and " Cash Flows from Continuing Operations" below and Note 8, "Debt," to our consolidated financial statements). CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS. We maintain our reserve based revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent. The banks participating in the facility have committed to lend us up to $425 million. The amount available under the facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks holding 75% of the aggregate commitments. The borrowing base is reduced by the principal amount of outstanding senior notes ($300 million at March 10, 2004) and 30% of the principal amount of any outstanding senior subordinated notes (a reduction of $75 million at March 10, 2004). The borrowing base is redetermined at least semi annually and, after reduction for the foregoing items, was $425 million at March 10, 2004. No assurances can be given that the banks will not elect to redetermine the borrowing base in the future. The facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions. The facility matures on January 23, 2005. We are in the process of replacing the facility with a new four year, $600 million, senior unsecured, reserve based revolving credit facility. We expect that the borrowing base features of the new facility will be substantially identical to those in the current facility. We also have money market lines of credit with various banks. Our credit facility limits our borrowings under these lines to $40 million. At March 10, 2004, we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $50 million and no borrowings under our money market lines. Consequently, at March 10, 2004, we had approximately $415 million of available capacity under our credit arrangements. At December 31, 2003, the interest rate for our outstanding LIBOR based loans was 2.5% and for our outstanding money market lines of credit was 3.0%. At December 31, 2002, the interest rate was 2.737% for LIBOR based loans under our credit facility and 2.615% for the loans outstanding under the money market lines of credit. During the third quarter of 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes (see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 8, "Debt Interest Rate Swaps," to our consolidated financial statements. WORKING CAPITAL. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements. Generally, we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements. As a result, we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. We had a working capital deficit of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2003. This compares to a working capital deficit of $57.0 million at the end of 2002 and a surplus of $65.6 million at the end of 2001. Our 2003 working capital deficit included $12.1 million in asset retirement obligations (see Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations"). Our 2002 working capital deficit included an $11.2 million secured note payment due January 2003 and accrued severance costs associated with the EEX acquisition. 24 CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. Our net cash flows from continuing operations were $659.2 million in 2003, $383.3 million in 2002 and $495.6 million in 2001. Our net cash flows from continuing operations in 2003 increased 72% when compared to 2002. The significant increase is due to higher oil and gas prices and a 25% increase in production volumes primarily due to the EEX acquisition. Net cash flows from continuing operations in 2002 declined 23% when compared to 2001. The decrease is primarily due to lower gas prices and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher production volumes. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. Our 2003 capital spending was $647 million, a 27% decrease from 2002 capital spending of $888 million. Capital spending in 2003 included approximately $142 million in acquisitions. In 2003, we also invested $302 million in domestic development, $155 million in domestic exploration, $32 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $16 million internationally. The largest component of 2002 spending was the $571 million acquisition of EEX in late 2002. In 2002, we also invested $150 million in domestic development, $106 million in domestic exploration, $53 million in other domestic acquisitions and $8 million internationally. In 2001, our capital spending totaled $846 million, including $435 million in acquisitions. The largest component of acquisition spending was our first quarter acquisition in the Mid Continent. In 2001, we invested $302 million in domestic development, $97 million in domestic exploration and $12 million internationally. We budgeted $600 million for capital spending in 2004, excluding acquisitions. We expect that 50% of this budget will be invested in the Gulf of Mexico (including deepwater), 40% in the onshore U.S. and the remainder internationally. We anticipate that our current capital expenditure budget for 2004 will be fully funded from cash flow from operations. To the extent that cash receipts during the year are slower than capital needs, we will make up the shortfall with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including the extent to which proved properties are acquired, drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing, size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable. Historically, we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year. Depending on the timing of an acquisition, we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties. CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $85.4 million compared to $137.0 million of net cash flows provided by financing activities for the same period of 2002. During 2003, we: repaid or repurchased $74.3 million principal amount of secured notes; settled our obligation under a gas sales contract, $62.0 million of which was accounted for as debt, in exchange for a cash payment by us; sold 3.5 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $131.2 million, or $37.49 per share; and redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $148.4 million. 25 CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The table below summarizes our significant contractual cash payment obligations and commitments, other than hedging contracts, by maturity as of December 31, 2003. Hedging contracts are excluded because they are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors. See " Oil and Gas Hedging" below.

(3) See Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments," to our consolidated financial statements. CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements" in this Item 7 for a description of our bank revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. SENIOR NOTES. In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 priced (at 99.931% of par) with a yield to maturity of 7.635%. Net proceeds from the offering of $173.1 million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility incurred in connection with our January 2001 Mid Continent acquisition. In October 1997, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. Our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by certain liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. 26 The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES. On August 13, 2002, we sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 priced with a yield to maturity of 8.50%. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $241.8 million were used to repay EEX debt that became due at the closing of the acquisition and to pay transaction costs. Because the proceeds were held in escrow pending the closing of the EEX acquisition, interest accrued prior to closing of the EEX acquisition of approximately $1.6 million was capitalized as a cost of the transaction. Interest on the notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after August 15, 2007 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes. Prior to August 15, 2007, we may redeem all but not part of the notes at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, before August 15, 2005, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 108.375% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; make certain dispositions of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets. SECURED NOTES. In the second quarter of 2001, EEX assumed the obligations under the secured notes in connection with the termination of two leveraged leasing arrangements. The notes accrued interest at a rate of 7.54% per year and were secured by the floating production system and pipelines described in Note 5, "Oil and Gas Assets Floating Production System and Pipelines," to our consolidated financial statements. At the time we acquired EEX, $100.8 million principal amount of secured notes were outstanding. In December 2002, we repurchased $23.6 million principal amount of the secured notes. During 2003, we repaid or repurchased $74.3 million of the $77.2 million outstanding principal amount of secured notes at year end 2002. The notes were repurchased with borrowings under our credit arrangements. The remaining secured notes were repaid in full in January 2004. COMMITMENTS UNDER JOINT OPERATING AGREEMENTS. The oil and gas industry operates in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating agreements, and our operations are no exception. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. These obligations are typically shared on a "working interest" basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. 27 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On May 4, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $50 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2001, we had purchased 823,000 shares for total consideration of $24.7 million at an average of $29.97 per share. During 2002, no shares were purchased under this program. In February 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $50 million from that date forward to repurchase shares of our common stock. No shares were purchased under this program. OIL AND GAS HEDGING We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 18 24 months as part of our risk management program. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs, such as our "gas mining" initiative. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Approximately 75% of our 2003 production was subject to hedge positions. In 2002, 84% of our production was subject to hedge positions, compared to 68% in 2001. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. We believe there is no material basis risk with respect to our natural gas price hedging contracts because substantially all of our hedged natural gas production is sold at market prices that historically have highly correlated to the settlement price. Because substantially all of our U.S. Gulf Coast oil production is sold at current market prices that historically have highly correlated to the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate price, we believe that we have no material basis risk with respect to these transactions. The actual cash price we receive, however, generally is about $2.00 per barrel less than the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate price when adjusted for location and quality differences. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2003, Bank of Montreal, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc., Barclays Bank PLC and J Aron & Company were the counterparties with respect to 82% of our future hedged production. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. In 2003, we entered into three way collar derivative contracts. Although our three way collar contracts are effective as economic hedges of our commodity price exposure, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Please see the discussion and tables in Note 6, "Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program and a listing of open hedging contracts as of December 31, 2003 and the fair value of those contracts as of that date. 28 Between December 31, 2003 and March 10, 2004, we entered into the additional natural gas price hedging contracts set forth in the table below.

The FPS is a combination deepwater drilling rig and processing facility capable of simultaneous drilling and production operations. These infrastructure assets are not currently in service and we do not have a specific use for them in our offshore operations. At the time of acquisition, we estimated their fair market value to be $35 million and classified them as "assets held for sale" under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This statement provides that an asset can only be classified as "held for sale" for one year. Accordingly, we have now re categorized them as held in use assets and they will be periodically evaluated for possible impairment. We have engaged brokers who survey the world market for potential application of the assets "as is" or "to be modified" for a particular application. We also have direct discussions with other operators about the potential application of the assets to their developments around the world. Because there is no established market for these unique assets, it is difficult to accurately estimate their fair market value. An immediate sale or a sale under distressed circumstances might realize less than the current carrying value of the assets. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in selling this asset or that any sale will recover the carrying value of the asset. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. 29 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. See "Results of Operations" in this Item 7, and Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES UNDER THE FULL COST METHOD. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: remaining proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS regarding the allocation of the purchase price. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION may be accounted for under one of two available methods. ACCOUNTING FOR COMMODITY DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES REQUIRES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS regarding the valuation of derivative positions. OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods for accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. FULL COST METHOD. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such 30 amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development also are capitalized. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. As a requirement of our revolving credit facility, independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least 80% of our proved reserves. For December 31, 2003, the independent reserve engineers reports covered properties representing 83% of our proved reserves and for such properties, the reserves were within 3% of the reserves we reported for such properties. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and oil prices decline, even if for only a short period of time, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The future net revenues associated with our estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. The full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging. See "Results of Operations Writedown of Oil and Gas Properties" in this Item 7. 31 COSTS WITHHELD FROM AMORTIZATION. Unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage, unamortized seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization. To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled). Incurred and future costs are allocated between completed and future work. Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $331 million of costs excluded from our amortization base, including $25.7 million associated with development costs for our deepwater Gulf of Mexico project known as "Glider," located at Green Canyon 247/248. Because the application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2003 resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base, without adding any associated reserves, would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. However, our future depletion rate will increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND ABANDONMENT COSTS. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. We review our assumptions and estimates of future abandonment costs on an annual basis. The accounting for future abandonment costs changed on January 1, 2003 with the adoption of SFAS No. 143. This new standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, a gain or loss is recognized. See " Results of Operations Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Adoption of SFAS No. 143." ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS As part of our growth strategy, we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is 32 subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we would be required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but must be evaluated periodically for impairment. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," under which goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill of each reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. As there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We elected to make December 31 our annual assessment date. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION In accordance with current accounting standards, there are two alternative methods that can be used to account for stock based compensation. The first method the intrinsic value method recognizes compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under the second method the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Currently, we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method. See Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation," to our consolidated financial statements. COMMODITY DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production. We generally hedge a substantial portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 18 24 months. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Most of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. Under the accounting rules, we designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production. To the extent that changes in the fair values of these derivatives offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold. To the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the change is recorded in income in the period it occurs. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting (such as three way collar contracts) are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the change occurs. In determining the amounts to be recorded, we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location. Where necessary, we adjust NYMEX prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices. Our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent third parties quotations. 33 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement changes the method of accounting for costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets (e.g. oil and gas production facilities, etc.) that we are obligated to incur. The statement requires that the fair value of the obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the asset retirement obligation be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the associated asset. Under our previous accounting method, we recognized the cost to abandon our oil and gas properties over their productive lives on a unit of production basis. See " Results of Operations Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Adoption of SFAS No. 143." In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of accounting for entities that elect to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation to the fair value method. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We adopted the disclosure provisions of this statement in our 2002 year end financial statements. We continue to apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for our stock based compensation plans. See " Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Stock Based Compensation" and Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation," to our consolidated financial statements. We adopted in 2002 or 2003, or will be required to adopt in 2004, several other new accounting standards. Please see Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Changes," to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these additional new accounting standards. Our adoption of these additional new standards has not had or is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," were issued by the FASB in June 2001 and became effective for us on July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, respectively. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method and that certain intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 established new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. Under the statement, goodwill and certain other intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment but are not amortized. To our knowledge, substantially all publicly traded oil and gas companies have continued to include oil and gas rights and interests held under leases, governmental licenses or other contractual arrangements ("leasehold interests") as part of oil and gas properties after SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 became effective. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) has added the oil and gas industrys application of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 to leasehold interests to an upcoming agenda. We continue to classify our leasehold interests as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided. See Note 1, "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Developments" to our consolidated financial statements. REGULATION WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT THE COST, MANNER OR FEASIBILITY OF DOING BUSINESS. Exploration, development, production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include: discharge permits for drilling operations; drilling bonds; reports concerning operations; 34 the spacing of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation. The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final decisions. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERCs more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the Outer Continental Shelf, or the Shelf, provide open access, non discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction. In addition, the FERC retains authority under OCSLA to exercise jurisdiction over entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction if necessary to ensure non discriminatory access to service on the Shelf. We do not believe that any FERC action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL. Our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum 35 products pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers. FEDERAL LEASES. The majority of our U.S. operations are located on federal oil and gas leases, which are administered by the MMS. These leases are issued through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed MMS regulations and orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject to change by the MMS). For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the MMS prior to the commencement of drilling. The MMS has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the Shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. The MMS also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas, and has proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization. Similarly, the MMS has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the MMS may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The MMS regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases. On August 20, 2003, the MMS issued a proposed rule that would change certain components of its valuation procedures for the calculation of royalties owed for crude oil sales. The proposed changes include changing the valuation basis for transactions not at arms length from spot to NYMEX prices adjusted for locality and quality differentials, and clarifying the treatment of transactions under a joint operating agreement. Final comments on the proposed rule were due on November 10, 2003. We cannot predict what action the MMS will take on this matter. We believe that the proposed rule will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION OF DRILLING AND PRODUCTION. We own interests in properties located onshore Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilling and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the obligation to perform investigatory and remedial activities or the imposition of injunctive relief. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, imposes regulations on "responsible parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A "responsible party" 36 includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate to the MMS that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for certain costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and MMS regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters. Since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters, we currently provide a total of $150 million in financial assurance to MMS. This $150 million in financial assurance is provided through $35 million in guaranteed net worth and $115 million in insurance. In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. CWA prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to comply with CWA, including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention, control and countermeasure or "SPCC" plans. We have such plans in existence and are currently upgrading or, as necessary, developing SPCC plans that will satisfy new SPCC plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in August 2004 and February 2005, respectively. OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste "drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy," legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes," which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could increase our operating costs, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under the Superfund law may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of 37 hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous state laws, and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Our foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such foreign requirements pertaining to the environment. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OIL AND GAS PRICES FLUCTUATE WIDELY, AND LOW PRICES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas. These prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce. Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are: the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the price and availability of alternative fuels; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price of foreign imports; world wide economic conditions; political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and domestic and foreign governmental regulations. OUR USE OF OIL AND GAS PRICE HEDGING CONTRACTS INVOLVES CREDIT RISK AND MAY LIMIT FUTURE REVENUES FROM PRICE INCREASES AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR NET INCOME. We use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use may also limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND, DEVELOP AND ACQUIRE OIL AND GAS RESERVES. As is generally the case, our producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by steep declines. To maintain production levels, we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production. Without successful exploration or acquisition activities, our reserves, production and revenues will decline rapidly. We may be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost. In addition, substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves. If lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit arrangements, we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves. 38 ACTUAL QUANTITIES OF RECOVERABLE OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THOSE RESERVES MOST LIKELY WILL VARY FROM OUR ESTIMATES. Estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates. Actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices. Our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. IF OIL AND GAS PRICES DECREASE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE WRITEDOWNS. We may be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results. We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, using period end oil and gas prices and a 10% discount factor, plus the lower of cost or fair market value for unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. We review the carrying value of our properties quarterly, based on prices in effect (including the effect of our hedge positions) as of the end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results. The carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country by country basis. Therefore, while our properties in one country may be subject to a writedown, our properties in other countries could be unaffected. Once incurred, a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including: recoverable reserves; future oil and gas prices; operating costs; and potential environmental and other liabilities. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. 39 Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an "as is" basis. COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS. Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage. Major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies. DRILLING IS A HIGH RISK ACTIVITY. Our future success will depend on the success of our drilling program. In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment. THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS INVOLVES MANY OPERATING RISKS THAT CAN CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES; INSURANCE MAY NOT PROTECT US AGAINST ALL THESE RISKS. These risks include: fires; explosions; blow outs; uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, formation water or drilling fluids; natural disasters; pipe or cement failures; casing collapses; embedded oilfield drilling and service tools; abnormally pressured formations; and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases. If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of: injury or loss of life; severe damage or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment; pollution and other environmental damage; investigatory and clean up responsibilities; 40 regulatory investigation and penalties; suspension of our operations; and repairs to resume operations. If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected. Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions, or result in loss of properties. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us. WE HAVE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. We currently have international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in select areas. Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the United States is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include: currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of expropriation, nationalization, war or insurrection; increases in taxes and governmental royalties; renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies; changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies; labor problems; and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. EXPLORATION IN DEEPWATER INVOLVES GREATER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RISKS THAN EXPLORATION AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS. These risks could result in substantial losses. Deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure. We will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs for any deepwater wells that we drill. In addition, much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment, resulting in significant financial and operating risks. In addition, as we carry out our drilling program in deepwater, it is likely that we will not initially serve as operator of the wells. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities in the deepwater of the Gulf of 41 Mexico. The success and timing of drilling and exploitation activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including: the timing and amount of capital expenditures; the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel; the operators expertise and financial resources; approval of other participants in drilling wells; and selection of technology. OTHER INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANIES LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MAY CHANGE OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS. Many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities. As a result, some of the other working interest owners of our wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. These problems could cause us to change, suspend or terminate our drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION This report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures, the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, wells planned to be drilled in the future, our financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources and other factors affecting our business described above under the captions "Regulation" and "Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results." All written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. OIL AND GAS PRICES We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 18 24 months as part of our risk management program. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and return on some of our acquisitions. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption "Oil and Gas Hedging" in Item 7 of this report. INTEREST RATES At December 31, 2003, we had $550 million in long term fixed rate debt. This debt was comprised of: $125 million of 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007; $175 million of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011; and $250 million of 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. Our year end 2003 variable rate debt consisted of $90 million borrowed under our bank revolving credit facility and $5 million borrowed under our money market lines of credit. The interest rate at December 31, 2003 for our LIBOR based loans under our credit facility was 2.5% and the interest rate for the money market lines was 3.0%. During 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to take advantage of low interest rates and to obtain what we view as a more desirable proportion of variable and fixed rate debt. These swap agreements provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments, and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes. As of December 31, 2003, $50 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 and $50 million principal amount of our 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 were subject to interest rate swaps. We considered our interest rate exposure at year end 2003 to be minimal because about 70% of our long term debt obligations, after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements, were at fixed rates. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10% change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be $0.4 million. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES Our cash flow from certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2003. 45
