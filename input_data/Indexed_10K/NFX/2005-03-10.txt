Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. Our domestic areas of operation include the Gulf of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid Continent and the Uinta Basin of the Rocky Mountains. Internationally, we are active offshore Malaysia, in the North Sea, offshore Brazil and in Chinas Bohai Bay. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Oil and Gas Prices. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Reserve Replacement. Most of our producing properties have declining production rates. As a result, to maintain and grow our production and cash flow we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. Significant Estimates. We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are: the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; the timing of future drilling, development and abandonment activities; the cost of these activities in the future; the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies; and the value of our derivative positions. Other Factors. Please see Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results in this Item 7 for a more detailed discussion of a number of other factors that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Results of Operations We completed several significant acquisitions during the second and third quarters of 2004. As described in more detail in the relevant discussions below, these acquisitions had a meaningful impact on our 2004 results of operations and cash flows. In May 2004, we entered into PSCs with Malaysias state owned oil company in partnership with its exploration and production subsidiary. In July 2004, we acquired producing oil and gas properties in Oklahoma. Also in July 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Denbury Offshore, Inc., the subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc. that held substantially all of its Gulf of Mexico assets. In August 2004, we acquired Inland Resources Inc. These acquisitions were financed through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit arrangements and offerings of our common stock and 14 Table of Contents our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. See Note 4, Acquisitions, Note 8, Debt, and Note 10, Common Stock Activity to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 in this report for a full discussion of these activities. On September 5, 2003, we sold our wholly owned subsidiary, Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd., which held all of our Australian assets. As a result of the sale, the historical results of our Australian operations are reflected on our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Please see Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements. Except where noted, discussions in this report relate to our continuing activities. Revenues. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production, which is net of the effects of the settlement of qualifying hedging contracts associated with our production. Settlement of our three way collar contracts, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, has no effect on our reported revenues. Our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices or production volumes. Revenues for 2004 reached a record $1.4 billion and were 33% higher than 2003 revenues due to a substantial increase in natural gas and crude oil prices and a 10% increase in production primarily resulting from the 2004 acquisitions mentioned above and our acquisition of Primary Natural Resources (PNR) in September 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Production(1): United States: Natural gas (Bcf) 197.6 184.2 144.7 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 6,686 6,054 5,235 Total (Bcfe) 237.7 220.6 176.1 International: Natural gas (Bcf) 0.6 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 879 Total (Bcfe) 5.9 Total: Natural gas (Bcf) 198.2 184.2 144.7 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 7,565 6,054 5,235 Total (Bcfe) 243.6 220.6 176.1 Average Realized Prices(2): United States: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 5.40 $ 4.60 $ 3.44 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 36.61 27.99 24.54 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 5.52 4.61 3.56 International: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 4.38 $ $ Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 44.26 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 7.07 Total: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 5.39 $ 4.60 $ 3.44 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 37.50 27.99 24.54 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 5.55 4.61 3.56 (1) Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced. (2) Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than our three way collar contracts, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Had we included the effects of these contracts, our average realized price for total natural gas would have been $5.36 per Mcf and our average realized price for total oil and condensate would have been $35.27 per Bbl for 2004. No three way contracts were settled in 2003 or 2002. 15 Table of Contents Production. Our 2004 total oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) increased 10% over 2003. The increase primarily was the result of our PNR acquisition in September 2003, the Oklahoma property and Denbury Offshore acquisitions in July 2004, the Inland acquisition in August 2004 and successful drilling efforts. In addition, liftings in Malaysia began during the third quarter of 2004. These increases were partially offset by shut in production of approximately 2.5 Bcfe during the third quarter of 2004 in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Ivan and natural field declines. Our 2003 total oil and gas production increased 25% over 2002 primarily as a result of our acquisition of EEX Corporation in November 2002, other small acquisitions and successful drilling efforts. In addition, 2002 production was reduced by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately one Bcfe of production in the first quarter of that year in response to low commodity prices and by the shut in of four Bcfe of production in the second half of that year in response to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural Gas. Our 2004 natural gas production increased 8% when compared to 2003. The increase primarily was the result of the 2004 acquisitions mentioned above and successful drilling efforts. The increase partially offset the shut in due to Hurricane Ivan described above and natural field declines. Our 2003 natural gas production was 27% higher when compared to 2002. The increase primarily was the result of our acquisition of EEX. Our development drilling programs in South Texas, the Mid Continent and the Gulf of Mexico also were major contributors to our production growth. In addition, 2002 production was reduced by the voluntarily curtailment and the shut ins described above. Crude Oil and Condensate. Our 2004 oil and condensate production increased 25% when compared to 2003 primarily due to initial production and liftings in Malaysia and the acquisition of Inland in the third quarter of 2004. Our domestic oil production increased primarily as a result of the Inland acquisition, partially offset by natural field declines. Our 2003 oil production increased 16% when compared to 2002 primarily due to development drilling programs in the U.S. and the acquisition of EEX in November 2002, which were partially offset by natural field declines in all producing regions. Effects of Hedging on Realized Prices. The following table presents information about the effects of our hedging program on realized prices. Average Realized Prices Ratio of Hedged to With Without Non Hedged Hedge(1) Hedge Price(2) Natural Gas: Year ended December 31, 2004 $ 5.39 $ 5.75 94 % Year ended December 31, 2003 4.60 5.15 89 % Year ended December 31, 2002 3.44 3.19 108 % Crude Oil and Condensate: Year ended December 31, 2004 $ 37.50 $ 40.95 92 % Year ended December 31, 2003 27.99 30.10 93 % Year ended December 31, 2002 24.54 24.78 99 % (1) Average realized prices in this column do not include the effects of our three way collar contracts, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Had we included the effects of these contracts, our average realized price for natural gas for 2004 would have been $5.36 per Mcf and our average realized price for oil and condensate for 2004 would have been $35.27 per Bbl. No three way contracts were settled in 2003 or 2002. (2) The ratio is determined by dividing the realized price (which includes the effects of hedging other than three way collar contracts) by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities. Operating Expenses. We are a growth oriented company. As such, our proved reserves and production have grown steadily since our founding. Naturally, our operating expenses have increased with our growth. As a result, we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our regularly recurring operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production, or per Mcfe, basis. 16 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2004. Unit of Production Amount (Per Mcfe) (In millions) Year Ended Year Ended December 31, Percentage December 31, Percentage Increase Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) 2004 2003 (Decrease) United States: Lease operating $ 0.57 $ 0.54 6 % $ 136.4 $ 119.3 14 % Production and other taxes 0.17 0.14 21 % 40.0 31.7 26 % Transportation 0.03 0.03 6.3 6.4 (2 %) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.95 1.79 9 % 463.4 394.7 17 % General and administrative 0.34 0.28 21 % 81.8 61.6 33 % Impairment of floating production system and pipelines 0.15 N/M (2) 35.0 N/M (2) Gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities 0.09 N/M (2) 20.5 N/M (2) Total operating expenses 3.21 2.87 12 % 762.9 634.2 20 % Total regularly recurring operating expenses(1) 3.06 2.78 10 % 727.9 613.7 19 % International: Lease operating $ 1.59 $ 9.3 Production and other taxes 0.38 2.3 Transportation Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.37 8.0 General and administrative 0.37 2.2 Ceiling test writedown 2.90 17.0 Total operating expenses 6.61 38.8 Total regularly recurring operating expenses(1) 3.71 21.8 Total: Lease operating $ 0.60 $ 0.54 11 % $ 145.7 $ 119.3 22 % Production and other taxes 0.17 0.14 21 % 42.3 31.7 33 % Transportation 0.03 0.03 6.3 6.4 (2 %) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.94 1.79 8 % 471.4 394.7 19 % General and administrative 0.34 0.28 21 % 84.0 61.6 36 % Ceiling test writedown 0.07 N/M (2) 17.0 N/M (2) Impairment of floating production system and pipelines 0.14 N/M (2) 35.0 N/M (2) Gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities 0.09 N/M (2) 20.5 N/M (2) Total operating expenses 3.29 2.87 15 % 801.7 634.2 26 % Total regularly recurring operating expenses(1) 3.08 2.78 11 % 749.7 613.7 22 % (1) Excludes the impairment of the floating production system and pipelines of $35.0 million and the ceiling test writedown of $17.0 million in 2004 and excludes the expenses associated with the settlement of our gas sales obligation and redemption of our trust preferred securities of $20.5 million in 2003. We believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses is to compare regularly recurring operating expenses only. We discuss the ceiling test writedown, the impairment, the settlement of our gas sales obligation and the redemption of our trust preferred securities separately below. See Ceiling Test Writedown, Impairment of Floating Production System and Pipelines, Gas Sales Obligation Settlement and Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities. (2) Not meaningful. Our 2004 total regularly recurring operating expenses, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 11% over 2003. Domestic Operations. Our domestic regularly recurring operating expenses for 2004, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 10% over the same period of 2003. This increase was primarily related to the following items: Lease operating expense (LOE), on an Mcfe basis, increased in 2004 as a result of higher operating costs and natural field declines in our Gulf of Mexico properties. Production and other taxes, on an Mcfe basis, increased in 2004 due to higher commodity prices and an increase in our production volumes subject to production taxes. 17 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (excluding furniture, fixtures and equipment) for 2004 was $1.94 per Mcfe versus $1.76 per Mcfe for the comparable period of 2003. The increase resulted from higher cost reserve additions during 2004. Accretion expense related to SFAS No. 143 was $0.05 per Mcfe for 2004 and $0.03 per Mcfe for 2003. General and administrative expense (G&A) for 2004, on an Mcfe basis, increased $0.06 per Mcfe, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to our growing workforce from acquisitions and an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of the increase in our 2004 profitability over 2003. During 2004, we capitalized $31.7 million of direct internal costs as compared to $26.7 million in 2003. International Operations. Prior to entering into the Malaysian PSCs, our producing international operations consisted of one field in the U.K. North Sea. Liftings in Malaysia began in the third quarter of 2004. The majority of LOE, production and other taxes and DD&A for 2004 relates to our Malaysian operations. G&A expense is primarily associated with our U.K. North Sea operations and the opening of our office in Malaysia during 2004. Year ended December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 Our Australian operations were sold in September 2003 and have been excluded from our reported operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Other international operations for these periods were immaterial and are not reported separately. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2003. Unit of Production Amount (Per Mcfe) (In millions) Year Ended Year Ended December 31, Percentage December 31, Percentage Increase Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) 2003 2002 (Decrease) Lease operating $ 0.54 $ 0.52 4 % $ 119.3 $ 90.8 31 % Production and other taxes 0.14 0.08 75 % 31.7 13.3 138 % Transportation 0.03 0.03 6.4 5.7 12 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.79 1.68 7 % 394.7 295.1 34 % General and administrative 0.28 0.31 (10 %) 61.6 54.4 13 % Gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities 0.09 N/M (2) 20.5 N/M (2) Total operating expenses 2.87 2.62 10 % 634.2 459.3 38 % Total regularly recurring operating expenses(1) 2.78 2.62 6 % 613.7 459.3 34 % (1) Excludes the expenses associated with the settlement of our gas sales obligation and redemption of our trust preferred securities during 2003 of $20.5 million, or $0.09 per Mcfe. We believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses is to compare regularly recurring operating expenses only. We discuss the settlement of our gas sales obligation and the redemption of our trust preferred securities separately below. See Gas Sales Obligation Settlement and Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities. (2) Not meaningful. Our total regularly recurring operating expenses, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 6% over 2002. The increase was primarily related to the following items: LOE on an Mcfe basis for 2003 increased 4% in large part due to the addition of higher cost onshore properties from the EEX acquisition and a higher level of workover activity in 2003. Production taxes on an Mcfe basis increased 75% in 2003 due to higher commodity prices. Additionally, a greater percentage of our production was onshore and subject to production taxes in 2003 as compared to 2002. DD&A (excluding furniture, fixtures and equipment) for 2003 was $1.76 per Mcfe versus $1.66 per Mcfe for 2002. Our adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 (see Cumulative Effect of 18 Table of Contents Change in Accounting Principle Adoption of SFAS No. 143) resulted in $0.03 per Mcfe of the increase. The remainder of the increase resulted from the increased cost of reserve additions during the year. G&A expense for 2003, on an Mcfe basis, before capitalized direct internal costs, increased $0.05 per Mcfe, or 14%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of our growth and an increase in incentive compensation expense due to the significant increase in 2003 earnings. The increase was offset by an increase in capitalized direct internal costs. During 2003, we capitalized $26.7 million of direct internal costs compared to $7.0 million in 2002. Ceiling Test Writedown. In November 2004, we announced that our Cumbria Prospect in the North Sea was a dry hole. Under full cost accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized in cost centers on a country by country basis. Because the unamortized costs exceeded the full cost ceiling, we were required to recognize a ceiling test writedown of $17.0 million in 2004. Impairment of Floating Production System and Pipelines. As a result of our acquisition of EEX in November 2002, we own a 60% interest in a floating production system, some offshore pipelines and a processing facility located at the end of the pipelines in shallow water. The floating production system is a combination deepwater drilling rig and processing facility capable of simultaneous drilling and production operations. At the time of acquisition, we estimated the fair market value of these assets to be $35.0 million. These infrastructure assets are not currently in service and we do not have a specific use for them in our offshore operations. Since their acquisition, we had undertaken to sell these assets. In December 2004, when what we believed was the last commercial opportunity for sale was not realized, we determined that there was no active market for these assets. As a result, in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $35.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 under the caption Impairment of floating production system and pipelines on our consolidated statement of income. Gas Sales Obligation Settlement. Pursuant to a gas forward sales contract entered into in 1999, EEX committed to deliver approximately 50 Bcf of production to a third party in exchange for proceeds of $105 million. When we acquired EEX, we recorded a liability of $61.6 million, which represented the then current market value of approximately 16 Bcf of remaining reserves subject to the contract. We accounted for the obligation under the gas sales contract as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. In March 2003, pursuant to a settlement agreement, the gas sales contract and all related agreements were terminated in exchange for a payment by us of approximately $73 million. We recognized a loss of $10.0 million under the caption Gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities on our consolidated statement of income as a result of the settlement. Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities. In June 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding convertible trust preferred securities for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $148.4 million, including $6.5 million of optional redemption premium. This premium and $4.0 million of unamortized offering costs (which were being amortized over the 30 year life of the securities) were expensed under the caption Gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities on our consolidated statement of income. We financed the redemption with the net proceeds (approximately $131.2 million) from the issuance and sale of 3.5 million shares of our common stock in May 2003 and borrowings under our credit arrangements. 19 Table of Contents Interest Expense. The following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Gross interest expense $ 57.7 $ 57.8 $ 34.5 Capitalized interest (25.8 ) (15.9 ) (8.8 ) Net interest expense 31.9 41.9 25.7 Distributions on preferred securities 4.6 9.3 Total interest expense and distributions $ 31.9 $ 46.5 $ 35.0 Gross Interest Expense. The components of gross interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2004 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Credit arrangements $ 5.0 $ 4.0 $ 2.9 Senior notes 23.2 23.2 23.2 Interest rate swaps (2.1 ) (0.7 ) Senior subordinated notes 30.2 22.1 5.2 Secured notes 0.4 5.6 0.6 Gas sales obligation 0.8 0.3 Other 1.0 2.8 2.3 Gross interest expense $ 57.7 $ 57.8 $ 34.5 Average outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements during 2004 were about 18% higher than during 2003 because we financed the cash consideration for our Oklahoma property and Denbury Offshore acquisitions (approximately $226 million) primarily with borrowings under our credit arrangements. The weighted average interest rate also was slightly higher in 2004. Average outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements during 2003 were about 30% more than during 2002 because of borrowings to repay or settle the EEX obligations described below and to finance our September 2003 acquisition of PNR (approximately $91 million). The weighted average interest rate was slightly lower in 2003 compared to 2002. During 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to $50 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 and $50 million principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. These swap agreements provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments. In August 2002, we issued $250 million principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 to finance the repayment of EEX obligations due at the closing and transaction costs. Because the proceeds were held in escrow pending closing, interest that accrued prior to the closing (approximately $1.6 million) was capitalized as a cost of the transaction. We issued $325 million principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 in August 2004 in connection with our acquisition of Inland later that month. In connection with our acquisition of EEX, we also assumed $100.8 million principal amount of secured notes (interest rate of 7.54% per annum) and $61.6 million under a gas forward sales contract (effective interest rate of 9.5% per annum). We repurchased $23.6 million principal amount of secured notes in December 2002. During 2003, we repurchased or repaid $74.3 million principal amount of secured notes. Interest expense for 2003 includes $3.9 million of premiums paid in connection with repurchases. In January 2004, we repurchased the remainder of the secured notes. We settled the gas forward sales contract in March 2003. The repurchase of secured notes and the settlement of the gas sales obligation were financed with borrowings under our credit arrangements. 20 Table of Contents Capitalized Interest. We capitalize interest with respect to unproved properties. Interest capitalized in 2004 increased over 2003 primarily due to an increase in our unproved property base as a result of the Inland acquisition. Capitalized interest increased during 2003 because of our increased unproved property base resulting from the EEX acquisition. Distributions on Preferred Securities. We redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities in June 2003 with the net proceeds from an offering of our common stock and borrowings under our credit arrangements. See Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities above. Commodity Derivative Expense. The following table presents information about the components of commodity derivative expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Cash Flow Hedges: Hedge ineffectiveness $ 3.8 $ (1.1 ) $ (0.5 ) Unrealized loss due to changes in time value (28.6 ) Three Way Collar Contracts: Unrealized (loss) due to changes in fair market value (3.4 ) (5.0 ) Realized (loss) on settlement (24.2 ) Total commodity derivative income (expense) $ (23.8 ) $ (6.1 ) $ (29.1 ) Hedge ineffectiveness is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. The unrealized loss associated with our cash flow hedges reflects the reversal of the time value gains that were recognized in 2001. See Note 6, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this report. The unrealized loss associated with our three way collar contracts represents changes in the fair market value of our open three way collar contracts (which do not qualify for hedge accounting). Taxes. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 37%, 36% and 36%, respectively. The effective tax rate for all three years was more than the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes associated with income from various states. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices, estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating expenses and capital costs. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Adoption of SFAS No. 143. We adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, as of January 1, 2003. This statement changed the method of accounting for expected future costs associated with our obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities and plug and abandon wells. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded a $134.8 million increase in the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and an initial asset retirement obligation, or ARO, of $128.5 million. Additionally, we recognized an after tax gain of $5.6 million (the after tax amount by which additional capitalized costs, net of accumulated depreciation, exceeded the initial ARO, including in each case discontinued operations) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this report. 21 Table of Contents Results of Discontinued Operations As a result of the sale of our Australian operations in September 2003, the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flow of these operations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. The results of our Australian operations for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2003 are summarized in Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow production and cash flow. We add new reserves and grow production through successful exploration and development drilling and the acquisition of properties. These activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have successfully grown our reserve base and production, resulting in net long term growth in our cash flow from operating activities. Fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for short term changes in our cash flow from operating activities. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year based on expected cash flow from operations for that year. In the past, we often have revised our capital budget upward several times during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. Because of the nature of the properties we own, a substantial majority of our capital budget is discretionary. Credit Arrangements. On March 16, 2004, we entered into a reserve based revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent. The banks participating in the facility have committed to lend us up to $600 million. The amount available under the facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks holding 75% of the aggregate commitments. The calculated borrowing base is then reduced by the principal amount of any outstanding senior notes ($300 million at February 28, 2005) and 30% of the principal amount of any outstanding senior subordinated notes (a reduction of $172.5 million at February 28, 2005). The borrowing base is redetermined at least semi annually and, after all required adjustments, exceeded the facility amount by $100 million and therefore was limited to $600 million at February 28, 2005. No assurances can be given that the banks will not determine in the future that the borrowing base should be reduced. The facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions. The facility matures on March 14, 2008. We also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount limited by our credit facility to $50 million. At February 28, 2005, we had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under our credit facility of $83 million and $31 million, respectively, and no outstanding borrowings under our money market lines. Consequently, at February 28, 2005, we had approximately $536 million of available capacity under our credit arrangements. Working Capital. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements. Generally, we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements. As a result, we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. We had a working capital deficit of $82.4 million as of December 31, 2004. This compares to working capital deficits of $61.3 million at the end of 2003 and $57.0 million at the end of 2002. Our 2004 working capital deficit includes $22.9 million in asset retirement obligations compared to $12.1 million in asset retirement obligations in 2003 (see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements) and a higher accrued employee incentive payable than in 2003 due to an increase in our 2004 net income and several deferred acquisition payments related to our 2004 acquisitions (see Note 7, Accrued Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements). Our working capital also is affected by fluctuations in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments. Our 2002 working capital deficit included an $11.2 million secured note payment due January 2003 and accrued severance costs associated with our acquisition of EEX. 22 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Continuing Operations. Cash flows from operations is primarily affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of hedging. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our natural gas and oil production under floating market contracts. However, we enter into hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We typically receive the cash associated with accrued oil and gas sales within 45 60 days of production. As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations is impacted by changes in working capital and is not affected by DD&A or writedowns. Our net cash flows from continuing operations were $997.5 million in 2004, a 51% increase over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 20% increase in our realized oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis) and a 10% increase in production volumes due to our acquisitions during 2004. See Results of Operations above. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $80.0 million due to the increased levels of development and exploration activities in progress at year end 2004, our growth from acquisitions during 2004 and higher commodity prices in effect at December 31, 2004. Our net cash flows from continuing operations were $659.2 million in 2003, a 72% increase over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 30% increase in oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis) and a 25% increase in production volumes as a result of our acquisition of EEX. See Results of Operations above. A substantial portion of the net increase of $38.0 million in other current assets in 2003 is related to a receivable for overpaid federal income taxes for 2003. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $40.0 million. Accounts payable fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of development and exploration activities in progress and the timing of payments made by us to vendors and other operators. In 2003, other liabilities decreased as a result of payments made by us in satisfaction of liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisition of EEX. Capital Expenditures. Our 2004 capital spending was $1,796 million, nearly three times our 2003 capital spending of $647 million. This included $719 million allocated for financial accounting purposes to the oil and gas properties acquired in our $575 million purchase of Inland. This also included approximately $225 million for acquisitions in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico. During 2004, we also invested $570 million in domestic development, $191 million in domestic exploration, $38 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $102 million internationally. The international capital spending included $49 million related to the acquisition of our Malaysian PSCs. Capital spending in 2003 was $647 million, a decrease of 27% from 2002 capital spending of $888 million. In 2003, we invested $302 million in domestic development, $155 million in domestic exploration, $32 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $16 million internationally. The 2003 amount included approximately $142 million in acquisitions. The largest component of 2002 spending was the $571 million acquisition of EEX in late 2002. In 2002, we also invested $150 million in domestic development, $106 million in domestic exploration, $53 million in other domestic acquisitions and $8 million internationally. 23 Table of Contents We have budgeted $950 million for capital spending in 2005, excluding acquisitions. Approximately 32% of the budget is allocated to the Gulf of Mexico (including the traditional shelf, the deep shelf and deepwater), 58% to the onshore U.S. and the remainder to international projects. We anticipate that our current capital expenditure budget for 2005 will be fully funded from cash flows from operations. To the extent that cash receipts during the year are slower than capital needs, we will make up the shortfall with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including the extent to which proved properties are acquired, drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing, size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable. Historically, we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year. Depending on the timing of an acquisition, we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $643.8 million compared to $85.4 million of net cash flows used in financing activities for the same period of 2003. During 2004, we: borrowed a net $25 million under our credit arrangements; sold 5.4 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $277 million, or $52.85 per share; and issued $325 million of senior subordinated notes. During 2003, we: borrowed a net $59 million under our credit arrangements; repaid or repurchased $74.3 million principal amount of secured notes; settled our obligation under a gas sales contract, $61.6 million of which was accounted for as debt; sold 3.5 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $131.2 million, or $37.49 per share; and redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $148.5 million. 24 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations The table below summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations and commitments by maturity as of December 31, 2004.

Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements above for a description of our bank revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. Senior Notes. In October 1997, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007. In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. Our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by certain liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. 25 Table of Contents The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. During the third quarter of 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes (see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8, Debt Interest Rate Swaps, to our consolidated financial statements). Senior Subordinated Notes. In August 2002, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. In August 2004, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of the 83/8% notes at any time on or after August 15, 2007 and some or all of the 65/8% notes at any time on or after September 1, 2009, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes. We also may redeem all but not part of the 83/8% notes prior to August 15, 2007 and all but not part of the 65/8% notes prior to September 1, 2009, in each case, at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, before August 15, 2005, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the 83/8% notes with the net cash proceeds from certain sales of our common stock at 108.375% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Likewise, before September 1, 2009, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the 65/8% notes with similar net cash proceeds at 106.625% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; make certain dispositions of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets. Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements. The oil and gas industry operates in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements, and our operations are no exception. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. 26 Table of Contents Malaysian PSC Commitments. Under the terms of our Malaysian PSCs, we have committed to spend $8.4 during the next five years on shallow water block PM 318 and $22.1 million during the next seven years on deepwater Block 2C. The consideration for our interest in PM 318 also includes our agreement to pay $10.5 million in the future as reimbursement for sunk costs. Employee Benefit Plan Obligations. In 2004, we contributed $0.2 million to our funded pension plan and $0.2 million to our unfunded post retirement medical plan. In 2005, we anticipate making a contribution of $0.2 million to our unfunded post retirement medical plan and a minimal contribution to our funded pension plan. Contributions to our funded plan increase the plan assets while contributions to our unfunded plan are made to fund current period benefit payments. Future contributions to our funded pension plan will be affected by actuarial assumptions, market performance and individual year funding decisions. See Note 13, Pension Plan Obligation and Note 14, Employee Benefit Plans Post Retirement Medical Plan, to our consolidated financial statements. Oil and Gas Hedging We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Approximately 72% of our 2004 production was subject to hedge positions (including both contracts that qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133). In 2003, 75% of our production was subject to hedge positions, compared to 84% in 2002. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. We believe there is no material basis risk with respect to our natural gas price hedging contracts because substantially all of our hedged natural gas production is sold at market prices that historically have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price. Because substantially all of our oil production is sold at current market prices that historically have had a high positive correlation to the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price, we believe that we have no material basis risk with respect to these transactions. The price we receive for our Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the WTI price. The price we receive for our production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $3 per barrel below the WTI price. Oil production from the Mid Continent typically sells at a $1.00 $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2004, Bank of Montreal, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays Bank PLC and J Aron & Company were the counterparties with respect to 78% of our future hedged production. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. In 2003, we began to utilize three way collar derivative contracts as part of our risk management program. Although our three way collar contracts are effective as economic hedges of our commodity price exposure, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Please see the discussion and tables in Note 6, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program and a listing of open contracts as of December 31, 2004 and the fair value of those contracts as of that date. 27 Table of Contents Between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2005, we entered into the additional natural gas price hedging contracts set forth in the table below.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. 29 Table of Contents Accounting for stock based compensation may be accounted for under one of two available methods. Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of derivative positions. Oil and Gas Activities Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. Full Cost Method. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. As a requirement of our credit facility, independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least 80% of our proved reserves. For December 31, 2004, the independent reserve engineers reports covered properties representing 86% of our proved reserves and for such properties, the reserves were within 1% of the reserves we reported for such properties. 30 Table of Contents Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. To increase our domestic DD&A rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2004 would require a decrease in our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2003 of approximately 10 Bcfe. Due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in the U.K. and Malaysia, any decrease in reserves associated with the respective countrys full cost pool would significantly increase the DD&A rate in that country. However, as our international operations represent less than 5% of our consolidated production for 2004, a change in our international DD&A expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. However, the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. The full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and oil prices decline, even if for only a short period of time, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. At December 31, 2004, the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in the U.S. and Malaysia exceeded the net capitalized costs of those properties by approximately $1.4 billion and $19 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, the net capitalized costs of our properties in the U.K. were written down to the present value of the estimated future net revenues from our U.K. proved reserves plus the fair value of unevaluated properties. Costs Withheld From Amortization. Unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization. To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled). Incurred and future costs are allocated between completed and future work. Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time 31 Table of Contents based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2004, our domestic full cost pool had approximately $745 million of costs excluded from the amortization base, including $25.7 million associated with development costs for our deepwater Gulf of Mexico project known as Glider, located at Green Canyon 247/248. At December 31, 2004, capital costs not subject to amortization include $341 million related to our acquisition of Inland. Due to the significant size of the Monument Butte Field, acquired in the Inland transaction, evaluation of the entire amount will require a number of years. Because the application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2004 resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our domestic oil and gas properties, inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base, without adding any associated reserves, would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. However, our future DD&A rate would increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves. Future Development and Abandonment Costs. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and future abandonment costs on an annual basis. The accounting for future abandonment costs changed on January 1, 2003 with the adoption of SFAS No. 143. This new standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, a gain or loss is recognized. See Results of Operations Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principal Adoption of SFAS No. 143 above. Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future abandonment and development costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD&A expense. Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD&A expense. To increase our domestic DD&A rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2004 would require an increase in the present value of our estimated future abandonment and development costs at December 31, 2003 of approximately $20 million. Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations As part of our growth strategy, we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain. The value allocated to the recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above. 32 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, under which goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill of each reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. As there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated. If it is overstated, such impairment would reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill. We elected to make December 31 our annual assessment date. Stock Based Compensation In accordance with current accounting standards, there are two alternative methods that can be used to account for stock based compensation. The first method the intrinsic value method recognizes compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under the second method the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Currently, we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method. However, in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements we have provided tabular information for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2004 that compares our net income and earnings per share as reported and on a pro forma basis as if we had used the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation. We will be required to adopt the fair value method in 2005. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements. Commodity Derivative Activities We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Except for our three way collar contracts, our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. Under the accounting rules, we designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production. To the extent that changes in the fair values of these derivatives offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold. To the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the change is recorded in income in the period in which it occurs. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting (such as three way collar contracts see Note 6, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements) are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the change occurs. In determining the amounts to be recorded, we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location. Where necessary, we adjust NYMEX prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices. Our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the 33 Table of Contents hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent, third party quotations. New Accounting Standards In September 2004, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 106 (SAB 106). This pronouncement requires companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities to include an estimate of future asset retirement costs to be incurred as a result of future development activities on proved reserves in their calculation of DD&A expense. It also requires full cost companies to exclude any cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations from their full cost ceiling test calculation. In addition, it requires specific disclosures regarding the impact of asset retirement obligations on oil and gas producing activities, ceiling test calculations and depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations. We will adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in the first quarter of 2005. Since our adoption of SFAS No. 143, we have included the asset retirement obligation as a reduction of our net capitalized costs in the determination of our full cost ceiling test calculation. Prospectively, we will calculate our full cost ceiling test in accordance with this pronouncement. We have calculated our DD&A expense in accordance with SAB 106 since our adoption of SFAS No. 143. Consequently, the adoption of SAB 106 will have no immediate effect on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement. We will adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in the third quarter of 2005. We have not completed our evaluation of the impact of SFAS No. 123(R) on our financial statements. Regulation We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include: discharge permits for drilling operations; drilling bonds; reports concerning operations; the spacing of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non price 34 Table of Contents controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation. The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, some aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final decisions. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERCs more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access, non discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction. The MMS has asked for comments on whether it should implement regulations under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities to ensure open and non discriminatory access on gathering systems and production facilities on the shelf. We have no way of knowing whether the MMS will proceed with implementing regulations of this nature; however we do not believe that any FERC or MMS action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Crude Oil. Our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers. Federal Leases. The majority of our U.S. operations are located on federal oil and gas leases, which are administered by the MMS. These leases are issued through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed MMS regulations and orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject to change by the MMS). For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the MMS prior to the commencement of drilling. The MMS has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the Shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. The MMS also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas, and has proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization. Similarly, the 35 Table of Contents MMS has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the MMS may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The MMS regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases. On May 5, 2004, the MMS issued a final rule that changed certain components of its valuation procedures for the calculation of royalties owed for crude oil sales. The changes include changing the valuation basis for transactions not at arms length from spot to NYMEX prices adjusted for locality and quality differentials, and clarifying the treatment of transactions under a joint operating agreement. We believe that the rule will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. State and Local Regulation of Drilling and Production. We own interests in properties located onshore Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilling and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. Environmental Regulations. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, or the issuance of injunctive relief. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate to the MMS that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for certain costs that may be incurred in responding 36 Table of Contents to an oil spill. Under OPA and implementing MMS regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters. Since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters, we currently provide a total of $150 million in financial assurance to MMS. In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. The CWA prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to comply with the CWA, including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to the CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. The OPA and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention, control and countermeasure or SPCC plans. We have such plans in existence and are currently amending these plans or, as necessary, developing new SPCC plans that will satisfy new SPCC plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in February 2006 and August 2006, respectively. OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also known as the EPA and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the Superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous state laws, and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Our foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to the environment and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such foreign requirements. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered. 37 Table of Contents Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas. These prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce. Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are: the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas; the price and availability of alternative fuels; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price of foreign imports; world wide economic conditions; political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and domestic and foreign governmental regulations. Our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income. We use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations. Our future success depends on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. As is generally the case, our producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by steep declines. To maintain production levels, we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production. Without successful exploration or acquisition activities, our reserves, production and revenues will decline rapidly. We may be unable to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost. In addition, substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves. If lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit arrangements, we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves. Actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of: the quality and quantity of available data; the interpretation of that data; the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate. The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates. 38 Table of Contents Actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices. Our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs in effect at December 31. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used. If oil and gas prices decrease, we may be required to take writedowns. We may be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices decrease or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs or deterioration in our exploration results. We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, using period end oil and gas prices and a 10% discount factor, plus the lower of cost or fair market value for unproved properties. If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. We review the carrying value of our properties quarterly, based on prices in effect (including the effect of our hedge positions) as of the end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results. The carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country by country basis. Therefore, while our properties in one country may be subject to a writedown, our properties in other countries could be unaffected. Once recorded, a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase. We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including: recoverable reserves; future oil and gas prices; operating costs; and potential environmental and other liabilities. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis. We may not achieve the production growth we anticipated from our properties in the Uinta Basin. In August 2004, we acquired Inland for approximately $575 million in cash. Inlands primary asset is the 110,000 acre Monument Butte Field located in the Uinta Basin of Northeast Utah. Waterflooding, a secondary recovery operation that involves the injection of large volumes of water into the oil producing reservoir, is necessary to recover the oil reserves in the field. We must negotiate with third parties to obtain additional sources of water. The crude oil produced in the Uinta Basin is known as black wax and has a higher paraffin content than crude oil found in most other major North American basins. Currently, area refineries have limited capacity to refine this type of crude oil. Our ability to significantly 39 Table of Contents increase production from the field may be limited by the unavailability of sufficient water supplies or refining capacity or both. In addition, the performance of waterflood operations is often difficult to predict. Competitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations. Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage. Major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies. Drilling is a high risk activity. Our future success will depend on the success of our drilling programs. In addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below, these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and producing wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment. The oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses; insurance may not protect us against all these risks. These risks include: fires; explosions; blow outs; uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, formation water or drilling fluids; natural disasters; pipe or cement failures; casing collapses; embedded oilfield drilling and service tools; abnormally pressured formations; and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases. If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of: injury or loss of life; severe damage or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment; pollution and other environmental damage; investigatory and clean up responsibilities; regulatory investigation and penalties; suspension of our operations; and repairs to resume operations. 40 Table of Contents If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected. Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities or reductions in revenue that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions, or result in the loss of properties. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us. Exploration in deepwater involves greater operating and financial risks than exploration at shallower depths. These risks could result in substantial losses. Deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure. We will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs in connection with the deepwater wells that we drill. In addition, much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment, resulting in significant financial and operating risks. In addition, as we carry out our deepwater program, we may not serve as the operator of significant projects in which we invest. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations related to these projects or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. The success and timing of drilling and exploitation activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including: the timing and amount of capital expenditures; the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel; the operators expertise and financial resources; approval of other participants in drilling wells; and selection of technology. We have risks associated with our foreign operations. We currently have international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in select areas. Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the United States is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include: currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations; loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of expropriation, nationalization, war or insurrection; increases in taxes and governmental royalties; renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies; changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies; labor problems; and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations. 41 Table of Contents Our international operations also may be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. Other independent oil and gas companies limited access to capital may change our exploration and development plans. Many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities. As a result, some of the other working interest owners of our wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. These problems could cause us to change, suspend or terminate our drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project. Forward Looking Information This report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures, the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, wells planned to be drilled in the future, product targets, anticipated production rates, our financing plans and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including: drilling results; oil and gas prices; well and waterflood performance; severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes); the prices of goods and services; the availability of drilling rigs and other support services; the availability of capital resources; and the other factors affecting our business described above under the captions Regulation and Other Factors Affecting our Business and Financial Results. All written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. 42 Table of Contents Commonly Used Oil and Gas Terms Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and gas business. Basis risk. The risk associated with the sales point price for oil or gas production varying from the reference (or settlement) price for a particular hedging transaction. Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil or condensate. Bcf. Billion cubic feet. Bcfe. Billion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. Btu. British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one pound mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Carried interest. An arrangement under which an interest in oil and gas rights is assigned in consideration for the assignee advancing all or a portion of the funds to explore on, develop or operate an oil or gas property. Completion. The installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. Deep shelf. We consider the deep shelf to be structures located on the shelf at depths generally greater than 15,000 feet in areas where there has been limited or no production from deeper stratigraphic zones. Deepwater. Generally considered to be water depths in excess of 1,000 feet. Developed acreage. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production. Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas field to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive, including a well drilled to find and produce probable reserves. Dry hole or well. A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes. Exploration or exploratory well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas reserves that is not a development well. Farm in or farm out. An agreement whereunder the owner of a working interest in an oil and gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion thereof to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally, the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a farm in, while the interest transferred by the assignor is a farm out. FERC. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FPSO. A floating production, storage and off loading vessel, commonly used overseas to produce oil locations where pipeline infrastructure may not exist. Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition. Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells in which we own a working interest. MBbls. One thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. Mcf. One thousand cubic feet. 43 Table of Contents Mcfe. One thousand cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. MMS. The Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior. MMBbls. One million barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. MMcf. One million cubic feet. MMcfe. One million cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. Net acres or net wells. The sum of the fractional working interests we own in gross acres or gross wells, as the case may be. NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange. Probable reserves. Reserves which analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data does not demonstrate to be proved under current technology and existing economic conditions, but where such analysis suggests the likelihood of their existence and future recovery. Productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes. Proved developed producing reserves. Proved developed reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals currently open in existing wells and capable of production to market. Proved developed reserves. Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved developed nonproducing reserves. Proved developed reserves expected to be recovered from zones behind casing in existing wells. Proved reserves. The estimated quantities of crude oil or natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved undeveloped reserves. Proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Shelf. The U.S. Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Water depths generally range from 50 feet to 1,000 feet. Tcfe. One trillion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production. Workover. Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. Oil and Gas Prices We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging in Item 7 of this report. Interest Rates At December 31, 2004, our long term debt was comprised of: Fixed Variable Rate Debt Rate Debt (In millions) Bank revolving credit facility(1) $ $ 120 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007(2) 75 50 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011(2) 125 50 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 250 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 325 $ 775 $ 220 (1) The interest rate at December 31, 2004 for our LIBOR based loans under our credit facility was 3.63%. (2) As of December 31, 2004, $50 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 and $50 million principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011 were subject to interest rate swaps. These swaps provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments, and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes. We considered our interest rate exposure at year end 2004 to be minimal because about 78% of our long term debt obligations, after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements, were at fixed rates. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10% change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be $0.7 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Our operations in the U.K. and Malaysia use the British pound and the Malaysian ringgit, respectively, as their functional currency. The functional currency for all other foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2004. 45 Table of Contents
