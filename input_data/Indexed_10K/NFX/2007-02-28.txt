Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. Our domestic areas of operation include the onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid Continent, the Uinta Basin of the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we are active offshore Malaysia and China and in the U.K. North Sea. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Oil and Gas Prices. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Reserve Replacement. Most of our producing properties have declining production rates. As a result, to maintain and grow our production and cash flow we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. Significant Estimates. We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are: the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; the timing of future drilling, development and abandonment activities; the cost of these activities in the future; the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies; and the value of our derivative positions. Results of Operations In 2005, four storms caused production deferrals in the Gulf of Mexico Dennis, Arlene, Katrina and Rita. The full year 2005 impact of these storms was a deferral of approximately 22 Bcfe of production from the Gulf of Mexico. The damage to infrastructure, pipelines and processing facilities continues to impact our Gulf of Mexico production. We are currently producing about 215 MMcfe/d and have about 90 MMcfe/d of deliverability offline. We expect that Gulf production will reach 250 MMcfe/d by the end of the first quarter of 2006 and 270 MMcfe/d by mid year. Production in 2006 also will be negatively impacted by the deferral of drilling and recompletions programs that were scheduled in the third and fourth quarters of 2005. We expect that deferrals associated with hurricanes will be about 15 Bcfe in 2006. We completed several significant acquisitions during the second and third quarters of 2004. As described in more detail below, these acquisitions had a meaningful impact on our 2005 and 2004 results of operations and cash flows. In May 2004, we entered into Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with Malaysias state owned oil company in partnership with its exploration and production subsidiary. Liftings of oil production in 19 Table of Contents Malaysia began in August 2004. In July 2004, we acquired producing oil and gas properties in Oklahoma. Also in July 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Denbury Offshore, Inc., the subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc. that held substantially all of its Gulf of Mexico assets. In August 2004, we acquired Inland Resources Inc. These acquisitions were financed through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit arrangements and offerings of our common stock and our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. See Note 4, Acquisitions, Note 8, Debt, and Note 10, Common Stock Activity, to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 in this report for a full discussion of these activities. In September 2003, we sold our wholly owned subsidiary, Newfield Exploration Australia Ltd., which held all of our Australian assets. As a result of the sale, the historical results of our Australian operations are reflected on our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Please see Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements. Except where noted, discussions in this report relate to our continuing activities. Revenues. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production, which is net of the effects of the settlement of qualifying hedging contracts associated with our production. Settlement of our derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting has no effect on our reported revenues. Our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices or production volumes. Revenues for 2005 reached a record $1.8 billion and were 30% higher than 2004 revenues due to a substantial increase in natural gas and crude oil prices, successful drilling efforts in the onshore Gulf Coast and Mid Continent areas and a full years production in 2005 from our Inland Resources acquisition and a full years liftings in Malaysia. This increase was partially offset by our Gulf of Mexico production deferrals of approximately 22 Bcfe caused by storms in 2005. 20 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Production(1): United States: Natural gas (Bcf) 190.9 197.6 184.2 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 7,152 6,686 6,054 Total (Bcfe) 233.7 237.7 220.6 International: Natural gas (Bcf) 0.1 0.6 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 1,294 879 Total (Bcfe) 7.9 5.9 Total: Natural gas (Bcf) 191.0 198.2 184.2 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 8,446 7,565 6,054 Total (Bcfe) 241.6 243.6 220.6 Average Realized Prices(2): United States: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 7.18 $ 5.40 $ 4.60 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 44.06 36.61 27.99 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 7.21 5.52 4.61 International: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 4.71 $ 4.38 $ Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 55.68 44.26 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 9.20 7.07 Total: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 7.17 $ 5.39 $ 4.60 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 45.84 37.50 27.99 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 7.27 5.55 4.61 (1) Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced. (2) Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Had we included the effect of these contracts, our average realized price for total gas would have been $6.65 per Mcf and $5.36 per Mcf for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $44.36 per Bbl and $35.27 per Bbl for 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting that settled in 2003. Production. Our 2005 total oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) decreased 1% from 2004. The decrease was a result of the Gulf of Mexico production deferrals of approximately 22 Bcfe related to the 2005 storms offset by a full years production from our 2004 acquisitions and successful drilling efforts. Our 2004 total oil and gas production increased 10% over 2003. The increase was primarily the result of our PNR acquisition in September 2003, the Oklahoma property and Denbury Offshore acquisitions in July 2004, the Inland acquisition in August 2004 and successful drilling efforts in the onshore Gulf Coast and Mid Continent areas. In addition, liftings in Malaysia began during the third quarter of 2004. These increases were partially offset by shut in production of approximately 2.5 Bcfe during the third quarter of 2004 in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Ivan and natural field declines. 21 Table of Contents Natural Gas. Our 2005 natural gas production decreased 4% when compared to 2004. The decrease was the result of production deferrals related to the 2005 storms and natural field declines offset by a full years production from our 2004 acquisitions. Our 2004 natural gas production increased 8% when compared to 2003. The increase primarily was the result of our 2004 acquisitions and successful drilling efforts. The increase was partially offset by shut in production during the third quarter of 2004 due to Hurricane Ivan and natural field declines. Crude Oil and Condensate. Our 2005 oil and condensate production increased 12% as a result of a full years production from the Inland Resources acquisition and a full year of liftings in Malaysia partially offset by production deferrals related to the 2005 storms. Our 2004 oil and condensate production increased 25% when compared to 2003 primarily due to initial production and liftings in Malaysia and the Inland Resources acquisition in the third quarter of 2004. Effects of Hedging on Realized Prices. The following table presents information about the effects of hedging on realized prices. Average Realized Ratio of Prices Hedged to With Without Non Hedged Hedge(1) Hedge Price(2) Natural Gas: Year ended December 31, 2005 $ 7.17 $ 7.54 95 % Year ended December 31, 2004 5.39 5.75 94 % Year ended December 31, 2003 4.60 5.15 89 % Crude Oil and Condensate: Year ended December 31, 2005 $ 45.84 $ 53.36 86 % Year ended December 31, 2004 37.50 40.95 92 % Year ended December 31, 2003 27.99 30.10 93 % (1) Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Had we included the effect of these contracts, our average realized price for total gas would have been $6.65 per Mcf and $5.36 per Mcf for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $44.36 per Bbl and $35.27 per Bbl for 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting that settled in 2003. (2) The ratio is determined by dividing the realized price (which includes the effects of hedging other than those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting) by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities. Operating Expenses. We are a growth oriented company. As such, our proved reserves and production have grown steadily since our founding. Naturally, our operating expenses have increased with our growth. As a result, we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production, or per Mcfe, basis. 22 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2005. Unit of Production Amount (Per Mcfe) (In millions) Year Ended Percentage Year Ended Percentage December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) 2005 2004 (Decrease) United States: Lease operating $ 0.81 $ 0.60 35 % $ 190 $ 143 33 % Production and other taxes 0.25 0.17 47 % 58 40 44 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.18 1.95 12 % 510 463 10 % General and administrative 0.43 0.34 26 % 101 82 24 % Other (0.12 ) 0.15 (180 %) (29 ) 35 (181 %) Total operating expenses 3.55 3.21 11 % 830 763 9 % International: Lease operating $ 1.90 $ 1.59 19 % $ 15 $ 9 61 % Production and other taxes 0.82 0.38 116 % 6 2 183 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.36 1.37 (1 %) 11 9 35 % General and administrative 0.44 0.43 2 % 3 2 36 % Ceiling test writedown 1.22 2.90 (58 %) 10 17 (44 %) Total operating expenses 5.74 6.67 (14 %) 45 39 15 % Total: Lease operating $ 0.85 $ 0.63 35 % $ 205 $ 152 35 % Production and other taxes 0.26 0.17 53 % 64 42 51 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.15 1.94 11 % 521 472 10 % General and administrative 0.43 0.34 26 % 104 84 24 % Ceiling test writedown 0.04 0.07 (43 %) 10 17 (44 %) Other (0.12 ) 0.14 (186 %) (29 ) 35 (181 %) Total operating expenses 3.61 3.29 10 % 875 802 9 % Domestic Operations. Our domestic operating expenses for 2005, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 11% over the same period of 2004. This increase was primarily related to the following items: Lease operating expense (LOE), on an Mcfe basis, was adversely impacted by deferred production of approximately 22 Bcfe related to the 2005 storms, higher operating costs, increased well workover activity and natural field declines in our Gulf of Mexico properties. Production and other taxes, on an Mcfe basis, increased due to higher commodity prices and an increase in the proportion of our production volumes subject to production taxes as a result of our acquisition of Inland Resources, increased production from our Mid Continent and onshore Gulf Coast operations and storm related deferrals in the Gulf of Mexico. 23 Table of Contents The increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) resulted from higher cost reserve additions. The component of DD&A associated with accretion expense related to SFAS No. 143 was $0.06 per Mcfe and $0.05 per Mcfe for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The component of DD&A associated with furniture, fixtures and equipment was $0.01 per Mcfe for 2005 and 2004. The increase in general and administrative expense (G&A) for 2005 of $0.09 per Mcfe, or 26%, was primarily due to growth in our workforce as a result of acquisitions and an increase in incentive compensation as a result of higher adjusted net income (as defined in our incentive compensation plan) in 2005 as compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives. During 2005, we capitalized $38 million of direct internal costs as compared to $30 million in 2004. Other expenses for 2005 and 2004 include the following items: In December 2005, we recorded a $22 million benefit related to our business interruption insurance coverage as a result of the operations disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result of our acquisition of EEX Corporation in November 2002, we owned a 60% interest in a floating production system, some offshore pipelines and a processing facility located at the end of the pipelines in shallow water. At the time of acquisition, we estimated the fair value of these assets to be $35 million. Since their acquisition, we had undertaken to sell these assets. In December 2004, when what we believed was the last commercial opportunity for sale was not realized, we determined that there was no active market for these assets. As a result, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $35 million. In early April 2005, we entered into an agreement with Diamond Offshore Services Company to sell our interest in the floating production facility and related equipment. In August 2005, we closed the sale and received net proceeds of $7 million, which were recorded as a gain on our consolidated statement of income. International Operations. In May 2004, we entered into PSCs with Malaysias state owned oil company with respect to two offshore blocks. Liftings of oil production began in August 2004. Prior thereto, our producing international operations consisted of one field in the U.K. North Sea, which we sold in June 2005. The increase in LOE primarily resulted from a full year of operations in Malaysia in 2005. Production and other taxes increased due to the significant increase in oil prices during 2005. A ceiling test writedown of $10 million associated with our decreased emphasis on exploration efforts in Brazil and in other non core international regions was recorded in December 2005. In 2004, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $17 million associated with a dry hole in the U.K. North Sea. 24 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 Our Australian operations were sold in September 2003 and have been excluded from our reported operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other international operations for 2003 were immaterial and are not reported separately. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2004. Unit of Production Amount (Per Mcfe) (In millions) Year Ended Percentage Year Ended Percentage December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) 2004 2003 (Decrease) United States: Lease operating $ 0.60 $ 0.57 5 % $ 143 $ 125 14 % Production and other taxes 0.17 0.14 21 % 40 32 26 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.95 1.79 9 % 463 395 17 % General and administrative 0.34 0.28 21 % 82 62 33 % Other 0.15 0.09 67 % 35 20 71 % Total operating expenses 3.21 2.87 12 % 763 634 20 % International: Lease operating $ 1.59 $ 9 Production and other taxes 0.38 2 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.37 9 General and administrative 0.43 2 Ceiling test writedown 2.90 17 Total operating expenses 6.67 39 Total: Lease operating $ 0.63 $ 0.57 11 % $ 152 $ 125 21 % Production and other taxes 0.17 0.14 21 % 42 32 33 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.94 1.79 8 % 472 395 19 % General and administrative 0.34 0.28 21 % 84 62 36 % Ceiling test writedown 0.07 N/M(1 ) 17 N/M (1) Other 0.14 0.09 56 % 35 20 71 % Total operating expenses 3.29 2.87 15 % 802 634 26 % (1) Not meaningful. Domestic Operations. Our domestic operating expenses for 2004, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 12% over the same period of 2003. This increase was primarily related to the following items: LOE, on an Mcfe basis, increased in 2004 as a result of higher operating costs and natural field declines in our Gulf of Mexico properties. Production and other taxes, on an Mcfe basis, increased in 2004 due to higher commodity prices and an increase in our production volumes subject to production taxes. 25 Table of Contents The increase in our DD&A for 2004 resulted from higher cost reserve additions. The component of DD&A associated with accretion expense related to SFAS No. 143 was $0.05 per Mcfe and $0.03 per Mcfe for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The component of DD&A associated with furniture, fixtures and equipment was $0.01 per Mcfe and $0.03 per Mcfe for 2004 and 2003, respectively. G&A expense for 2004 increased $0.06 per Mcfe, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to our growing workforce from acquisitions and an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of the increase in our 2004 profitability over 2003. During 2004, we capitalized $30 million of direct internal costs as compared to $27 million in 2003. Other expenses for 2004 and 2003 include the following items: As a result of our acquisition of EEX Corporation in November 2002, we owned a 60% interest in a floating production system, some offshore pipelines and a processing facility located at the end of the pipelines in shallow water. At the time of acquisition, we estimated the fair value of these assets to be $35 million. Since their acquisition, we had undertaken to sell these assets. In December 2004, when what we believed was the last commercial opportunity for sale was not realized, we determined that there was no active market for these assets. As a result, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $35 million. Pursuant to a gas forward sales contract entered into in 1999, EEX committed to deliver approximately 50 Bcf of production to a third party in exchange for proceeds of $105 million. When we acquired EEX, we recorded a liability of $62 million, which represented the then current market value of approximately 16 Bcf of remaining reserves subject to the contract. We accounted for the obligation under the gas sales contract as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. In March 2003, pursuant to a settlement agreement, the gas sales contract and all related agreements were terminated in exchange for a payment by us of approximately $73 million. We recognized a loss of $10 million under the caption Other on our consolidated statement of income as a result of the settlement. In June 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding convertible trust preferred securities for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $149 million, including $6 million of optional redemption premium. This premium and $4 million of unamortized offering costs (which were being amortized over the 30 year life of the securities) were expensed under the caption Other on our consolidated statement of income. We financed the redemption with the net proceeds (approximately $131 million) from the issuance and sale of 3.5 million shares of our common stock in May 2003 and borrowings under our credit arrangements. International Operations. Prior to entering into the Malaysian PSCs, our producing international operations consisted of one field in the U.K. North Sea. Liftings in Malaysia began in the third quarter of 2004. The majority of LOE, production and other taxes and DD&A for 2004 relates to our Malaysian operations. G&A expense is primarily associated with our U.K. North Sea operations and the opening of our office in Malaysia during 2004. In November 2004, we announced that our Cumbria Prospect in the North Sea was a dry hole. Under full cost accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized in cost centers on a country by country basis. Because the unamortized costs exceeded the full cost ceiling, we recognized a ceiling test writedown of $17 million in 2004. 26 Table of Contents Interest Expense. The following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Gross interest expense $ 72 $ 58 $ 58 Capitalized interest (46 ) (26 ) (16 ) Net interest expense 26 32 42 Distributions on preferred securities 5 Total interest expense and distributions $ 26 $ 32 $ 47 Gross Interest Expense. The components of gross interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Credit arrangements $ 4 $ 5 $ 4 Senior and subordinated notes 67 53 45 Interest rate swaps (2 ) (1 ) Secured notes 1 6 Other 1 1 4 Gross interest expense $ 72 $ 58 $ 58 The increase in gross interest expense in 2005 is primarily due to an entire year of accrued interest related to our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 issued in August 2004 in connection with our acquisition of Inland Resources. During the second half of 2004, we financed the cash consideration for our Oklahoma property and Denbury Offshore acquisitions (approximately $226 million) primarily with borrowings under our credit arrangements. By the end of the second quarter of 2005, we had repaid all of the borrowings under our credit facilities for the 2004 acquisition. During 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to $50 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 and $50 million principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. These swap agreements provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments. In connection with our 2002 acquisition of EEX, we also assumed $101 million principal amount of secured notes (interest rate of 7.54% per annum) and $62 million under a gas forward sales contract (effective interest rate of 9.5% per annum). During 2003, we repurchased or repaid $74 million principal amount of secured notes. Interest expense for 2003 includes $4 million of premiums paid in connection with repurchases. In January 2004, we repurchased the remainder of the secured notes. We settled the gas forward sales contract in March 2003. The repurchase of secured notes and the settlement of the gas sales obligation were financed with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Capitalized Interest. We capitalize interest with respect to unproved properties. Interest capitalized increased in 2005 over 2004, and in 2004 over 2003 primarily due to an increase in our unproved property base as a result of the Inland Resources acquisition in late August 2004. Distributions on Preferred Securities. We redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities in June 2003 with the net proceeds from an offering of our common stock and borrowings under our credit arrangements. 27 Table of Contents Commodity Derivative Expense. The following table presents information about the components of commodity derivative expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Cash Flow Hedges: Hedge ineffectiveness $ (8 ) $ 4 $ (1 ) Derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges: Unrealized (loss) on discontinued cash flow hedges (11 ) Realized (loss) on settlement of discontinued cash flow hedges (51 ) Unrealized (loss) due to changes in fair market value (191 ) (4 ) (5 ) Realized (loss) on settlement (61 ) (24 ) Total commodity derivative expense $ (322 ) $ (24 ) $ (6 ) Hedge ineffectiveness is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. As a result of the production deferrals in the Gulf of Mexico related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, hedge accounting was discontinued during the third quarter of 2005 on a portion of our contracts that had previously qualified as effective cash flow hedges of our Gulf of Mexico production and other contracts were redesignated as hedges of our onshore Gulf Coast production. As a result, we recorded an $11 million unrealized loss which represents the unrealized hedging loss previously deferred to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) Commodity derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet. The unrealized loss due to changes in fair market value is associated with our derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and represents changes in the fair value of our open contracts during the period. Taxes. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 36%, 37% and 36%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was more than the federal statutory tax rate for all three years primarily due to state income taxes associated with income from various states in which we have operations and the excess of the Malaysia statutory tax rate over the U.S. federal statutory rate. Our effective tax rate for the year 2005 was less than our effective tax rate for 2004 primarily due to the realization of a net change of $5 million in our valuation allowance for tax assets related to certain of our international operations. The $8 million valuation allowance related to our U.K. net operating loss carryforwards was reversed in 2005 as a result of a substantial increase in estimated future taxable income as a result of our Grove discovery in the U.K. North Sea. In 2005, we recorded a $3 million valuation allowance for various international and Brazilian deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices, the timing and amount of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Adoption of SFAS No. 143. We adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, as of January 1, 2003. This statement changed the method of accounting for expected future costs associated with our obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities and plug and abandon wells. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded a $135 million increase in the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and an initial asset retirement obligation, or ARO, of $129 million. Additionally, we recognized an after tax gain of $6 million (the after tax amount by which additional capitalized costs, net of accumulated depreciation, exceeded the initial ARO, including in each case discontinued operations) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this report. Discontinued Operations As a result of the sale of our Australian operations in September 2003, the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flow of these operations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as 28 Table of Contents discontinued operations. The results of our Australian operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 are summarized in Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow production and cash flow. We add new reserves and grow production through successful exploration and development drilling and the acquisition of properties. These activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have successfully grown our reserve base and production, resulting in net long term growth in our cash flow from operating activities. Fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for short term changes in our cash flow from operating activities. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year based on expected cash flow from operations for that year. In the past, we often have revised our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. Because of the nature of the properties we own, a substantial majority of our capital budget is discretionary. We maintain insurance against many of the operating risks associated with exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico. We believe that the costs to repair and replace platforms, pipelines and wells damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will be substantially offset by proceeds from physical damage, control of well, operators extra expense and business interruption insurance. Credit Arrangements. In December 2005, we entered into a revolving credit facility that matures in December 2010. The terms of the credit facility provide for initial loan commitments of $1 billion from a syndication of participating banks, led by JPMorgan Chase as the agent bank. The loan commitments under the credit facility may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $1.5 billion if the lenders increase their loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the credit facility. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank or the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points or (b) a base Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (100 basis points per annum at December 31, 2005). At February 28, 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility has restrictive covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed .60 to 1.0; maintenance of a ratio of total debt to earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, exploration and abandonment expense and other noncash charges and expenses to consolidated interest expense of at least 3.5 to 1.0; and as long as our debt rating is below investment grade, the maintenance of an annual ratio of the calculated net present value of our oil and gas properties to total debt of at least 1.75 to 1.00. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of its debt covenants. As of February 28, 2006, we had $71 million of undrawn letters of credit under our credit facility. The letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility are subject to annual fees, based on a grid of our debt rating (87.5 basis points at February 28, 2006) plus an issuance fee of 12.5 basis points. We also have a total of $110 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various banks. At February 28, 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under our money market lines. Working Capital. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements. Generally, we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements. As a result, we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. We had a working capital deficit of $130 million as of December 31, 2005. This compares to working capital deficits of $82 million at the end of 2004 and $61 million at the end of 2003. Our working capital deficit is affected by fluctuations in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2005, we had a net short term derivative liability of $89 million, a net short term derivative asset of $8 million at December 31, 2004 and $31 million of net short term derivative liability 29 Table of Contents at December 31, 2003. Our 2005 working capital deficit also includes $47 million in asset retirement obligations compared to $23 million in 2004 and $12 million in 2003 (see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements). Our 2005 and 2004 working capital deficits include a higher accrued employee incentive payable than in 2003 due to an increase in our 2005 and 2004 net income. Our 2005 and 2004 working capital deficit also includes several deferred acquisition payments related to our 2004 acquisitions (see Note 7, Accrued Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements). Cash Flows from Operations. Cash flows from operations is primarily affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of hedging. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our natural gas and oil production under floating market contracts. However, we enter into hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We typically receive the cash associated with accrued oil and gas sales within 45 60 days of production. As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations is impacted by changes in working capital and is not affected by DD&A, writedowns or other non cash charges. Our net cash flows from operations were $1,109 million in 2005, an 11% increase over the prior year. Although our 2005 production volumes were impacted by production deferrals related to the 2005 storms, higher commodity prices offset the cash flow impact of the deferred production. Realized oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis) increased 31% over 2004. See Results of Operations above. Our net cash flows from operations were $997 million in 2004, a 51% increase over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 20% increase in our realized oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis) and a 10% increase in production volumes due to our acquisitions during 2004. See Results of Operations above. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $80 million due to the increased levels of development and exploration activities in progress at year end 2004, our growth from acquisitions during 2004 and higher commodity prices in effect at December 31, 2004. Capital Expenditures. Our 2005 capital spending was $1,119 million, a 38% decrease from our 2004 capital spending of $1,796 million, excluding asset retirement obligations of $44 million in 2005 and $48 million in 2004. During 2005, we invested $696 million in domestic exploitation and development, $257 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $81 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $85 million internationally. Our 2004 capital spending of $1,796 million was nearly three times our 2003 capital spending of $647 million (excluding asset retirement obligations of $32 million in 2003). This included $719 million allocated for financial accounting purposes to the oil and gas properties acquired in our $575 million purchase of Inland. This also included approximately $225 million for acquisitions in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico. During 2004, we also invested $570 million in domestic exploitation and development, $191 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $38 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $102 million internationally. The international capital spending included $49 million related to the acquisition of our Malaysian PSCs. We budgeted $1.9 billion for capital spending in 2006, excluding acquisitions. The total includes $1.6 billion for new capital projects, $180 million for hurricane repairs in the Gulf of Mexico (substantially all of which will be offset with proceeds from insurance) and $105 million for capitalized interest and overhead. Approximately 23% of the $1.6 billion of capital projects is allocated to the Gulf of Mexico (including the traditional shelf, the deep and ultra deep shelf and deepwater), 22% to the onshore Gulf Coast, 27% in the Mid Continent, 9% in the Rocky Mountains and 19% to international projects. See Item 1, Business Plans for 2006. To the extent that cash flow from operations during the year is lower than our capital needs, we will make up the shortfall with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including the extent to which proved properties are acquired, drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing, size and purchase price of 30 Table of Contents acquisitions are unpredictable. Historically, we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year. Depending on the timing of an acquisition, we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $88 million compared to $644 million of net cash flows provided by financing activities for the same period of 2004. During 2005, we: repaid a net $120 million under our credit arrangements; and received net proceeds of $32 million from issuance of shares of common stock. During 2004, we: borrowed a net $25 million under our credit arrangements; repurchased $3 million principal amount of secured notes; sold 5.4 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $277 million, or $52.85 per share; and issued $325 million of senior subordinated notes.

Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements above for a description of our bank revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. 31 Table of Contents Senior Notes. In October 1997, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007. In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. Our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by certain liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. During the third quarter of 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes (see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8, Debt Interest Rate Swaps, to our consolidated financial statements). Senior Subordinated Notes. In August 2002, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. In August 2004, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of the 83/8% notes at any time on or after August 15, 2007 and some or all of the 65/8% notes at any time on or after September 1, 2009, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes. We also may redeem all but not part of the 83/8% notes prior to August 15, 2007 and all but not part of the 65/8% notes prior to September 1, 2009, in each case, at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, before September 1, 2007, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the 65/8% notes with similar net cash proceeds at 106.625% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; make certain dispositions of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets. Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements. The oil and gas industry operates in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements, and our operations are no exception. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the 32 Table of Contents operator. These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. Oil and Gas Activities. As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. We have work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data and fulfilling other cash commitments. At December 31, 2005, these work related commitments total $195 million and are comprised of $93 million in the United States and $102 million internationally. These items are included in the total column of the Contractual Obligations table above but not included by maturity, as their timing cannot be accurately predicted. Oil and Gas Hedging We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Approximately 81% of our 2005 production was subject to derivative contracts (including both contracts that qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended). In 2004, 72% of our production was subject to derivative contracts, compared to 75% in 2003. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. The price we receive for our Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price we receive for our production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $6 per barrel below the WTI price. Oil production from the Mid Continent typically sells at a $1.00 $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2005, Bank of Montreal, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays Bank PLC and J Aron & Company were the counterparties with respect to 77% of our future hedged production. Please see the discussion and tables in Note 6, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program and a listing of open contracts as of December 31, 2005 and the fair value of those contracts as of that date. 33 Table of Contents Between January 1, 2006 and February 27, 2006, we entered into the additional natural gas price derivative contracts set forth in the table below.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described in Contractual Obligations Oil and Gas Activities above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 34 Table of Contents Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee. See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. Accounting for stock based compensation may be accounted for under one of two available methods. Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of derivative positions. Oil and Gas Activities Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. Full Cost Method. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. 35 Table of Contents Proved Oil and Gas Reserves. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. As a requirement of our bank facility, independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least 70% of the present value of our proved reserves. For December 31, 2005, the independent reserve engineers reports covered properties representing 81% of our proved reserves and 82% of the present value. For such properties, the reserves were within 3% of the reserves we reported for such properties. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. To increase our domestic DD&A rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2005 would require a decrease in our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2004 of approximately 10 Bcfe. Due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in the U.K., Malaysia and China, any decrease in reserves associated with the respective countrys full cost pool would significantly increase the DD&A rate in that country. However, as our international operations in the U.K. and China were not producing during the year and production from our Malaysian operations represents less than 5% of our consolidated production for 2005, a change in our international DD&A expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. However, the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. The full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and oil prices decline, even if for only a short period of time, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. At December 31, 2005, the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in the U.S. exceeded the net capitalized costs of those properties by approximately $2.2 billion. The ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in Malaysia, the U.K. and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the properties by approximately $63 million, $150 million and $40 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Due to the relatively small size of these international pools, holding all other factors constant, if natural gas prices decline 36 Table of Contents to a range of $3.25 $3.50 per Mcf and oil prices decline to a range of $45 $50 per Bbl, it is possible that we could experience ceiling test writedowns in one or all of these international areas. Costs Withheld From Amortization. Unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization. To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled). Incurred and future costs are allocated between completed and future work. Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2005, our domestic full cost pool had approximately $840 million of costs excluded from the amortization base, including $26 million associated with development costs for our deepwater Gulf of Mexico project known as Glider, located at Green Canyon 247/248. At December 31, 2005, capital costs not subject to amortization include $316 million related to our acquisition of Inland. Due to the significant size of the Monument Butte Field, acquired in the Inland transaction, evaluation of the entire amount will require a number of years. Because the application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2005 resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our domestic oil and gas properties, inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base, without adding any associated reserves, would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. However, our future DD&A rate would increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves. Future Development and Abandonment Costs. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and future abandonment costs on an annual basis. The accounting for future abandonment costs is set forth by SFAS No. 143. This standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future abandonment and development costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD&A expense. Likewise, if these estimates are revised 37 Table of Contents downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD&A expense. To increase our domestic DD&A rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2005 would require an increase in the present value of our estimated future abandonment and development costs at December 31, 2004 of approximately $25 million. Due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in the U.K., Malaysia and China, any change in future abandonment and or development costs associated with the respective countrys full cost pool would significantly change the DD&A rate in that country. However, as our international operations in the U.K. and China were not producing during the year and production from our Malaysian operations represents less than 5% of our consolidated production for 2005, a change in our international DD&A expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations As part of our growth strategy, we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain. The value allocated to the recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, under which goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill of each reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. As there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated. If it is overstated, such impairment would reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill. We elected to make December 31 our annual assessment date. Stock Based Compensation For 2005 there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stock based compensation. The first method the intrinsic value method recognizes compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under the second method the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Currently, we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method. However, in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements we have provided tabular information for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005 that compares our net income and earnings per share as reported and on a pro forma basis as if we had used the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation. We will adopt the fair value method in the first quarter of 2006. See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements. Commodity Derivative Activities We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our 38 Table of Contents anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Under the accounting rules, we can elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production. To the extent that changes in the fair values of the cash flow hedges offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold. To the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the change is recorded in income in the period in which it occurs. Derivatives that do not qualify for (such as three way collar contracts see Note 6, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements) or have not been designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the change occurs. In determining the amounts to be recorded for cash flow hedges, we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location. Where necessary, we adjust NYMEX prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices. Our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent, third party quotations. New Accounting Standards We will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) at the beginning of the first quarter of 2006. We currently expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will impact our results of operations, but will not impact our financial position. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on our reported results of operations for future periods will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in the table included in Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements. Regulation Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. An overview of this regulation is set forth below. We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business in Item 1A of this report. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price controls in the future. 39 Table of Contents Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation. The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, some aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final decisions. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERCs more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access, non discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction. Therefore, we do not believe that any FERC or MMS action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (2005 EPA). This comprehensive act contains many provisions that will encourage oil and gas exploration and development in the U.S. The 2005 EPA directs the FERC, MMS and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the 2005 EPA. We believe that neither the 2005 EPA, nor the regulations promulgated, or to be promulgated, as a result of the 2005 EPA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Crude Oil. Our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers. Federal Leases. The majority of our U.S. operations are located on federal oil and gas leases, which are administered by the MMS. These leases are issued through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed MMS regulations and orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject to change by the MMS). For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the MMS prior to the commencement of drilling. The MMS has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the Shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications. The MMS also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas, and prohibiting the burning of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization. Similarly, the MMS has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment 40 Table of Contents of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the MMS may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The MMS regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases. The 2005 EPA formalizes the royalty in kind program of the MMS, providing that the MMS may take royalties in kind if the Secretary of the Interior determines that the benefits are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value. We believe that the MMS royalty in kind program will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. State and Local Regulation of Drilling and Production. We own interests in properties located onshore Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah. We also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilling and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. Environmental Regulations. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, or the issuance of injunctive relief. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. Moreover, some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate to the MMS that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for certain costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and implementing MMS regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least 41 Table of Contents $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters. Since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters, we currently provide a total of $150 million in financial assurance to MMS. In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. The CWA prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to comply with the CWA, including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to the CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. The OPA and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention, control and countermeasure or SPCC plans. We have such plans in existence and are currently amending these plans or, as necessary, developing new SPCC plans that will satisfy new SPCC plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in February 2006 and October 2007, respectively. OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also known as the EPA and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the Superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous state laws, and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and comparable state statutes restricts the emission of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. Also, EPA has developed and continues to develop more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees, state and local governmental authorities and the public. International Regulations. Our exploration and production operations outside the United States are subject to various types of regulations similar to those described above imposed by the respective governments 42 Table of Contents of the countries in which we operate, and may affect our operations and costs within that country. We currently have operations in Malaysia, China and the United Kingdom. Forward Looking Information This report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures, the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, wells planned to be drilled in the future, product targets, anticipated production rates, our financing plans and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including: drilling results; oil and gas prices; well and waterflood performance; severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes); the prices of goods and services; the availability of drilling rigs and other support services; the availability of capital resources; and the other factors affecting our business described above under the caption Risk Factors. All written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. 43 Table of Contents Commonly Used Oil and Gas Terms Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and gas business. Basis risk. The risk associated with the sales point price for oil or gas production varying from the reference (or settlement) price for a particular hedging transaction. Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein in reference to crude oil or condensate. Bcf. Billion cubic feet. Bcfe. Billion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. Btu. British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one pound mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Carried interest. An arrangement under which an interest in oil and gas rights is assigned in consideration for the assignee advancing all or a portion of the funds to explore on, develop or operate an oil or gas property. Completion. The installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. Deep shelf. We consider the deep shelf to be structures located on the shelf at depths generally greater than 14,000 feet in over pressured horizons where there has been limited or no production from deeper stratigraphic zones. Prospects in this play are typically greater than 30 Bcfe and have dry hole costs of $15 30 million. Deepwater. Generally considered to be water depths in excess of 1,000 feet. Developed acreage. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production. Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas field to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. Dry hole or well. A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes. Exploitation Well. An exploration well drilled to find and produce probable reserves. Most of the exploitation wells we drilled in 2005 and expect to drill in 2006 are located in the Mid Continent or Monument Butte Field. Exploitation wells in those areas have less risk and less reserve potential and typically may be drilled at a lower cost than other exploration wells. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we combine exploitation and development activities. Exploration or exploratory well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas reserves that is not a development well. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we exclude exploitation activities from exploration activities. Farm in or farm out. An agreement whereunder the owner of a working interest in an oil and gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion thereof to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally, the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a farm in, while the interest transferred by the assignor is a farm out. FERC. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FPSO. A floating production, storage and off loading vessel, commonly used overseas to produce oil locations where pipeline infrastructure may not exist. Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition. 44 Table of Contents Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells in which we own a working interest. MBbls. One thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. Mcf. One thousand cubic feet. Mcfe. One thousand cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. MMS. The Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior. MMBbls. One million barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. MMcf. One million cubic feet. MMcfe. One million cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. Net acres or net wells. The sum of the fractional working interests we own in gross acres or gross wells, as the case may be. NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange. Probable reserves. Reserves which analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data does not demonstrate to be proved under current technology and existing economic conditions, but where such analysis suggests the likelihood of their existence and future recovery. Productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes. Proved developed producing reserves. Proved developed reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals currently open in existing wells and capable of production to market. Proved developed reserves. In general, proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The SEC provides a complete definition of proved developed reserves in Rule 4 10(a)(3) of Regulation S X. Proved developed nonproducing reserves. Proved developed reserves expected to be recovered from zones behind casing in existing wells. Proved reserves. In general, the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The SEC provides a complete definition of proved reserves in Rule 4 10(a)(2) of Regulation S X. Proved undeveloped reserves. In general, proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. The SEC provides a complete definition of proved undeveloped reserves in Rule 4 10(a)(4) of Regulation S X. Shelf. The U.S. Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Water depths generally range from 50 feet to 1,000 feet. Tcfe. One trillion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf gas to one Bbl of crude oil or condensate. Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production. Workover. Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 45 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. Oil and Gas Prices We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging in Item 7 of this report and Note 6, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements. Interest Rates At December 31, 2005, our long term debt was comprised of: Fixed Variable Rate Debt Rate Debt (In millions) Bank revolving credit facility $ $ 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007(1) 75 50 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011(1) 125 50 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 250 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 325 Total long term debt $ 775 $ 100 (1) As of December 31, 2005, $50 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 and $50 million principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011 were subject to interest rate swaps. These swaps provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments, and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes. We considered our interest rate exposure at year end 2005 to be minimal because a substantial majority, about 89% of our long term debt obligations, after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements, were at fixed rates. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10% change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be less than $1 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The British pound is the functional currency for our operations in the United Kingdom. The functional currency for all other foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2005. 46 Table of Contents
