Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. Our domestic areas of operation include the onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid Continent, the Uinta Basin of the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we are active offshore Malaysia and China and in the U.K. North Sea. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Oil and Gas Prices. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production as a part of our risk management program. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Reserve Replacement. Most of our producing properties have declining production rates. As a result, to maintain and grow our production and cash flow we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. Significant Estimates. We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are: the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; the timing of future drilling, development and abandonment activities; the cost of these activities in the future; the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies; the value of our derivative positions; and the fair value of stock based compensation. Accounting for Hedging Activities. Beginning October 1, 2005, we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis, we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. Please see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities. Results of Operations Revenues. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production, which includes the effects of the settlement of derivative contracts associated with our production that are accounted for as hedges. Settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges has no effect on our reported revenues. Please see Note 5, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated 21 Table of Contents financial statements appearing later in this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts. Our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold. Revenues of $1.7 billion for 2006 were 5% lower than 2005 revenues due to lower gas prices and lower oil production partially offset by higher oil prices and increased gas production. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Production(1): United States: Natural gas (Bcf) 198.7 190.9 197.6 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 6,218 7,152 6,686 Total (Bcfe) 236.0 233.7 237.7 International: Natural gas (Bcf) 0.1 0.6 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 1,097 1,294 879 Total (Bcfe) 6.6 7.9 5.9 Total: Natural gas (Bcf) 198.7 191.0 198.2 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 7,315 8,446 7,565 Total (Bcfe) 242.6 241.6 243.6 Average Realized Prices(2): United States: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 6.47 $ 7.18 $ 5.40 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 51.40 44.06 36.61 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 6.80 7.21 5.52 International: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ $ 4.71 $ 4.38 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 56.58 55.68 44.26 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 9.43 9.20 7.07 Total: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 6.47 $ 7.17 $ 5.39 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 52.18 45.84 37.50 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 6.87 7.27 5.55 (1) Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced. (2) Average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting. Had we included the effect of these contracts, our average realized price for total gas would have been $7.22, $6.65 and $5.36 per Mcf for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $50.25, $44.36 and $35.27 per Bbl for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Without the effects of hedging contracts, our average realized prices for 2006, 2005 and 2004 would have been $6.42, $7.54 and $5.75 per Mcf, respectively, for gas and $59.13, $53.36 and $40.95 per barrel, respectively, for oil. Production. Our 2006 total oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) was essentially the same as total production for 2005. Successful drilling efforts in the Mid Continent were offset by continued Gulf of Mexico production deferrals of approximately 16 Bcfe during 2006 related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, natural field declines and the timing of liftings of oil production in Malaysia. Our 2005 total oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) decreased 1% from 2004. The 22 Table of Contents decrease was a result of Gulf of Mexico production deferrals of approximately 22 Bcfe related to the 2005 storms offset by a full years production from our 2004 acquisitions and successful drilling efforts. Natural Gas. Our 2006 natural gas production increased 4% over 2005. The increase was primarily the result of successful drilling efforts in the Mid Continent partially offset by continued Gulf of Mexico production deferrals during the first half of 2006 related to the 2005 storms and natural field declines. Our 2005 natural gas production decreased 4% when compared to 2004. The decrease was the result of production deferrals related to the 2005 storms and natural field declines offset by a full years production from our 2004 acquisitions. Crude Oil and Condensate. Our 2006 oil and condensate production decreased 13% primarily as a result of the timing of liftings of oil production in Malaysia. Our 2005 oil and condensate production increased 12% when compared to 2004 primarily due to a full years production from the Inland Resources acquisition and a full year of liftings in Malaysia partially offset by production deferrals related to the 2005 storms. Operating Expenses. Generally, our proved reserves and production have grown steadily since our founding. As a result, our operating expenses also have increased. We believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production, or per Mcfe, basis. 23 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2006. Unit of Production Amount Year Ended Percentage Year Ended Percentage December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) 2006 2005 (Decrease) (Per Mcfe) (In millions) United States: Lease operating $ 1.11 $ 0.81 37 % $ 261 $ 190 38 % Production and other taxes 0.21 0.25 (16 %) 49 58 (15 %) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.59 2.18 19 % 611 510 20 % General and administrative 0.49 0.43 14 % 116 101 14 % Other (0.04 ) (0.12 ) (67 %) (11 ) (29 ) (63 %) Total operating expenses 4.36 3.55 23 % 1,026 830 24 % International: Lease operating $ 2.40 $ 1.90 26 % $ 16 $ 15 5 % Production and other taxes 1.77 0.82 116 % 12 6 81 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.00 1.36 47 % 13 11 23 % General and administrative 1.28 0.44 191 % 8 3 144 % Ceiling test writedown 0.94 1.22 (23 %) 6 10 (35 %) Total operating expenses 8.39 5.74 46 % 55 45 22 % Total: Lease operating $ 1.14 $ 0.85 34 % $ 277 $ 205 36 % Production and other taxes 0.25 0.26 (4 %) 61 64 (5 %) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.57 2.15 20 % 624 521 20 % General and administrative 0.51 0.43 19 % 124 104 18 % Ceiling test writedown 0.03 0.04 (25 %) 6 10 (35 %) Other (0.04 ) (0.12 ) (67 %) (11 ) (29 ) (63 %) Total operating expenses 4.46 3.61 24 % 1,081 875 24 % Domestic Operations. Our domestic operating expenses for 2006, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 24% over the same period of 2005. This increase was primarily related to the following items: Lease operating expense (LOE) increased due to higher operating costs for all of our operations and significantly higher insurance costs for our Gulf of Mexico operations. Additionally, 2006 LOE was impacted by the difference ($0.07 per Mcfe) between insurance proceeds received from the settlement of all claims related to the 2005 hurricanes and actual repair expenditures during 2006. Without the impact of the costs related to the repairs for the 2005 storms in excess of our insured amount, our LOE would have been $1.04 per Mcfe for 2006. Production and other taxes decreased primarily due to refunds related to production tax exemptions on certain of our onshore high cost gas wells in Texas. The increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions. The cost of reserve additions was adversely impacted by escalating costs of drilling goods and services experienced during 2006. The component of DDA associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was $0.06 per Mcfe for 2006 and 2005. Please see 24 Table of Contents Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements. General and administrative (GA) expense increased approximately $0.06 per Mcfe primarily due to stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Please see Note 11, Stock based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements. The increase attributable to stock based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense as a result of lower adjusted net income (as defined in our incentive compensation plan) in 2006 as compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives. During 2006, we capitalized $40 million of direct internal costs as compared to $38 million in 2005. Other expenses for 2006 and 2005 include the following items: In 2006, we redeemed all $250 million of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. We recorded a charge for the $19 million early redemption premium we paid and a charge of $8 million for the remaining unamortized original issuance costs related to the notes. In addition, we recorded a $37 million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage in 2006 relating to the disruptions to our operations caused by the 2005 storms. In 2005, we recorded a $22 million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage and sold our interest in the floating production system and related equipment we acquired in the EEX transaction for a net gain of $7 million. International Operations. Our international operating expenses for 2006, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 46% over 2005. The increase was primarily related to the following items: LOE increased because our production in Malaysia decreased while total LOE remained relatively unchanged. Our Malaysian LOE primarily consists of fixed costs related to our FPSO. Production and other taxes increased as a result of higher crude oil prices. DDA increased as a result of higher cost reserve additions in Malaysia and initial liftings of oil production in China during the third quarter of 2006. GA expense increased due to stock compensation expense recognized as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and growth in our international workforce. We recorded a ceiling test writedown of $6 million associated with ceasing our exploration efforts in Brazil in 2006. In 2005, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $10 million associated with our decreased emphasis on exploration efforts in Brazil and in other non core international regions. 25 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2005.

Our domestic operating expenses for 2005, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 11% over the same period of 2004. This increase was primarily related to the following items: LOE was adversely impacted by deferred production of approximately 22 Bcfe related to the 2005 storms, higher operating costs, increased well workover activity and natural field declines in our Gulf of Mexico properties. Production and other taxes increased due to higher commodity prices and an increase in the proportion of our production volumes subject to production taxes as a result of our acquisition of the Monument Butte Field, increased production from our Mid Continent and onshore Gulf Coast operations and storm related deferrals in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase in our DDA rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions. The component of DDA associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was $0.06 per Mcfe and $0.05 per Mcfe for 2005 and 2004, respectively. 26 Table of Contents The increase in GA expense was primarily due to growth in our workforce as a result of acquisitions and an increase in incentive compensation as a result of higher adjusted net income (as defined in our incentive compensation plan) in 2005 as compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives. During 2005, we capitalized $38 million of direct internal costs as compared to $30 million in 2004. Other expenses for 2005 and 2004 include the following items: In December 2005, we recorded a $22 million benefit related to our business interruption insurance coverage as a result of the disruptions in our operations caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result of our acquisition of EEX Corporation in November 2002, we owned a 60% interest in a floating production system, some offshore pipelines and a processing facility located at the end of the pipelines in shallow water. At the time of acquisition, we estimated the fair value of these assets to be $35 million. Since their acquisition, we had undertaken to sell these assets. In December 2004, when what we believed was the last commercial opportunity for sale was not realized, we determined that there was no active market for these assets. As a result, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $35 million. In early April 2005, we entered into an agreement with Diamond Offshore Services Company to sell our interest in the floating production facility and related equipment. In August 2005, we closed the sale and received net proceeds of $7 million, which were recorded as a gain on our consolidated statement of income. International Operations. In May 2004, we entered into PSCs with Malaysias state owned oil company with respect to two offshore blocks. Liftings of oil production began in August 2004. Prior thereto, our producing international operations consisted of one field in the U.K. North Sea, which we sold in June 2005. The increase in LOE primarily resulted from a full year of operations in Malaysia in 2005. Production and other taxes increased due to the significant increase in oil prices during 2005. A ceiling test writedown of $10 million associated with our decreased emphasis on exploration efforts in Brazil and in other non core international regions was recorded in December 2005. In 2004, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $17 million associated with a dry hole in the U.K. North Sea. Interest Expense. The following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Gross interest expense $ 87 $ 72 $ 58 Capitalized interest (44 ) (46 ) (26 ) Net interest expense $ 43 $ 26 $ 32 The increase in gross interest expense in 2006 resulted primarily from the April 13, 2006 issuance of $550 million principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016, partially offset by the May 3, 2006 redemption of $250 million principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. The 2005 increase is primarily due to an entire year of accrued interest related to our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 issued in August 2004 in connection with our acquisition of the Monument Butte Field. During the second half of 2004, we financed the cash consideration for our acquisitions of properties in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico (aggregating approximately $226 million) primarily with borrowings under our credit arrangements. By the end of the second quarter of 2005, we had repaid all of the borrowings under our credit arrangements for the 2004 acquisitions. 27 Table of Contents We capitalize interest with respect to unproved properties. Interest capitalized increased in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to an increase in our unproved property base as a result of the Inland Resources acquisition in late August 2004. Commodity Derivative Income (Expense). The following table presents information about the components of commodity derivative income (expense) for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In millions) Cash flow hedges: Hedge ineffectiveness $ 5 $ (8 ) $ 4 Other derivative contracts: Realized (loss) on settlement of discontinued cash flow hedges (51 ) Unrealized gain (loss) due to changes in fair market value 249 (202 ) (4 ) Realized gain (loss) on settlement 135 (61 ) (24 ) Total commodity derivative income (expense) $ 389 $ (322 ) $ (24 ) Hedge ineffectiveness is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. As a result of the production deferrals experienced in the Gulf of Mexico related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, hedge accounting was discontinued during the third quarter of 2005 on a portion of our contracts that had previously qualified as effective cash flow hedges of our Gulf of Mexico production and other contracts were redesignated as hedges of our onshore Gulf Coast production. As a result, realized losses of $51 million associated with derivative contracts for the third and fourth quarters of 2005, which were in excess of hedged physical deliveries for those periods, were reported as commodity derivative expense. The unrealized gain (loss) due to changes in fair market value is associated with our derivative contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting and represents changes in the fair value of these open contracts during the period. Taxes. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 38%, 36% and 37%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was more than the federal statutory tax rate for all three years primarily due to state income taxes and the excess of the Malaysia and U.K. statutory tax rates over the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, our effective tax rate for 2006 increased as a result of an $18 million ($15 million U.K. and $3 million Brazilian) valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards in those countries that are not expected to be realized. The $15 million U.K. valuation allowance is due to a substantial decrease in estimated future taxable income as a result of the disappointing results of the recent #7 well in our Grove field in the U.K. North Sea. Our effective tax rate for the year 2005 was less than our effective tax rate for 2004 primarily due to the realization of a net change of $5 million in our valuation allowance for tax assets related to certain of our international operations. An $8 million valuation allowance related to our U.K. net operating loss carryforwards was reversed in 2005 as a result of a substantial increase in estimated future taxable income as a result of our 2005 Grove discovery in the U.K. North Sea. In 2005, we recorded a $3 million valuation allowance for various international and Brazilian deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards that were not expected to be realized. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices, the timing and amount of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow production and cash flow. We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and the acquisition of properties. These activities require substantial capital expenditures. Over the long term, we have successfully grown our reserve base and production, resulting in growth in our net cash flows from operating activities. Fluctuations in commodity 28 Table of Contents prices and the 2005 hurricanes have been the primary reason for short term changes in our cash flow from operating activities. In August 2006, we reached an agreement with our insurance underwriters to settle all claims related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (business interruption, property damage and control of well/operators extra expense) for $235 million. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year based in part on expected cash flow from operations for that year. In the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. Because of the nature of the properties we own, contractual capital commitments beyond 2007 are not significant. Our 2007 capital budget exceeds currently expected cash flow from operations by approximately $350 million. We anticipate that the shortfall will be made up with cash and short term investments on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements. On October 15, 2007, our 7.45% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $125 million become due. We currently plan to fund the repayment with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Credit Arrangements. In December 2005, we entered into a revolving credit facility that matures in December 2010. Our credit facility provides for initial loan commitments of $1 billion from a syndication of participating banks, led by JPMorgan Chase as the agent bank. The loan commitments may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $1.5 billion if the current lenders increase their loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the credit facility. Loans under our credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points or (b) a base Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (100 basis points per annum at December 31, 2006). At February 26, 2007, we had no outstanding borrowings and $52 million of undrawn letters of credit under our credit facility. The credit facility has restrictive covenants that include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization not to exceed 0.6 to 1.0; maintenance of a ratio of total debt to earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of assets, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, exploration and abandonment expense and other noncash charges and expenses to consolidated interest expense of at least 3.5 to 1.0; and, as long as our debt rating is below investment grade, the maintenance of an annual ratio of the net present value of our oil and gas properties to total debt of at least 1.75 to 1.00. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We also have a total of $110 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various banks. At February 26, 2007, we had outstanding borrowings of $45 million under our money market lines. As of February 26, 2007, we had approximately $951 million of available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements. Working Capital. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements. Generally, we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements. As a result, we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. We had a working capital deficit of $272 million as of December 31, 2006. This compares to working capital deficits of $130 million at the end of 2005 and $82 million at the end of 2004. The majority of the working capital deficit at December 31, 2006 relates to the reclassification of our $125 million 7.45% Senior Notes due October 15, 2007 as a current liability and an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of our significant capital activities towards the end of 2006. The increase in accrued liabilities is due to our increased exploration and development activity and higher service costs over 2005. Our working capital balances are also affected by fluctuations in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our short term derivatives was a net asset of $200 million. At December 31, 2005, this amount was a net short term derivative liability of $89 million. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our short term derivatives was a net asset of $8 million (see Note 5, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements). Our 2006 working capital deficit also includes $40 million in asset retirement obligations compared to $47 million 29 Table of Contents in 2005 and $23 million in 2004 (see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements). Cash Flows from Operations. Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts. Our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our natural gas and oil production under floating market contracts. However, we enter into commodity hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices, to help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and to manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We typically receive the cash associated with accrued oil and gas sales within 45 60 days of production. As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations is impacted by changes in working capital and is not affected by DDA, writedowns or other non cash charges or credits. Our net cash flow from operations was $1,384 million in 2006, a 25% increase over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to 2006 realized oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis), including the effects of hedging contracts (regardless of whether designated for hedge accounting), which increased 9% over 2005. See Results of Operations above. Our net cash flows from operations were $1,109 million in 2005, an 11% increase over the prior year. Although our 2005 production volumes were impacted by the 2005 storms, higher commodity prices offset the cash flow impact of the deferred production. Realized oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis), including the effects of hedging contracts (regardless of whether designated for hedge accounting), increased 25% over 2004. See Results of Operations above. Capital Expenditures. Our 2006 capital spending was $1,890 million, a 69% increase from our 2005 capital spending of $1,119 million. These amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of $16 million in 2006 and $44 million in 2005. During 2006, we invested $1,161 million in domestic exploitation and development, $379 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $71 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $279 million internationally. Our 2005 capital spending was $1,119 million, a 38% decrease from our 2004 capital spending of $1,796 million (excluding recorded asset retirement obligations of $48 million). During 2005, we invested $696 million in domestic exploitation and development, $257 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $81 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $85 million internationally. We budgeted $1.8 billion for capital spending in 2007, excluding acquisitions. This total includes $50 million for continuing hurricane repairs in the Gulf of Mexico and excludes $100 million for capitalized interest and overhead. Approximately 24% of the $1.8 billion is allocated to the Gulf of Mexico (including the traditional shelf, the deep and ultra deep shelf and deepwater), 19% to the onshore Gulf Coast, 38% to the Mid Continent, 8% to the Rocky Mountains and 11% to international projects. See Item 1, Business Plans for 2007. Since our 2007 capital budget exceeds currently forecasted cash flow, we plan to make up the shortfall with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including the extent to which proved properties are acquired, drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. Historically, with the exception of 2006, we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year. Depending on the timing of an acquisition, we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for 2006 were $317 million compared to $88 million of net cash flows used in financing activities for 2005. In October 2007, our $125 million principal amount 7.45% Senior Notes will become due. We currently anticipate repaying these notes with borrowings under our credit arrangements. 30 Table of Contents During 2006, we: issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016; used the proceeds from this offering to redeem $250 million principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012; borrowed and repaid $519 million under our credit arrangements; and received proceeds of $15 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock. During 2005, we: repaid a net $120 million under our credit arrangements; and received proceeds of $32 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock.

As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. We have work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data and fulfilling other cash commitments. At December 31, 2006, these work related commitments total $257 million and are comprised of $160 million in the United States and $97 million internationally. These amounts are not included by maturity because their timing cannot be accurately predicted. Credit Arrangements. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements above for a description of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. 31 Table of Contents Senior Notes. In October 1997, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007. In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. Our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by certain liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. During the third quarter of 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes (see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8, Debt Interest Rate Swaps, to our consolidated financial statements). Senior Subordinated Notes. In August 2004, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. In April 2006, we issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016. Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of our 65/8% notes due 2014 at any time on or after September 1, 2009 and some or all of our 65/8% notes due 2016 at any time on or after April 15, 2011, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes. We also may redeem all but not part of our 65/8% notes due 2014 prior to September 1, 2009 and all but not part of our 65/8% notes due 2016 prior to April 15, 2011, in each case, at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, before September 1, 2007, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of our 65/8% notes due 2014 with the net cash proceeds from certain sales of our common stock at 106.625% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Likewise, before April 15, 2009, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of our 65/8% notes due 2016 with similar net cash proceeds at 106.625% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; make certain dispositions of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets. 32 Table of Contents Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements. Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. Oil and Gas Hedging We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Approximately 57% of our 2006 production was subject to derivative contracts (including both contracts that are designated and not designated for hedge accounting). In 2005, 81% of our production was subject to derivative contracts, compared to 72% in 2004. While the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. Historically, all of our hedged natural gas and crude oil production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges. Therefore, we believe that our hedged production is not subject to material basis risk. The price that we receive for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically averages $0.40 $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for our Mid Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average $0.70 $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. The price we receive for our Gulf Coast oil production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price we receive for our oil production in the Rocky Mountains is currently averaging about $13 $15 per barrel below the WTI price. Oil production from the Mid Continent typically sells at a $1.00 $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from our operations in Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Oil sales from our operations in China are currently averaging about $15 per barrel less than the WTI. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2006, Bank of Montreal, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, N.A. and J Aron Company were the counterparties with respect to 73% of our future hedged production. Please see the discussion and tables in Note 5, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program and a listing of open contracts as of December 31, 2006 and the fair value of those contracts as of that date. 33 Table of Contents Between January 1, 2007 and February 26, 2007, we entered into additional natural gas price derivative contracts set forth in the table below.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described above under Contractual Obligations Oil and Gas Activities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 34 Table of Contents See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of derivative positions. Stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgements. Oil and Gas Activities Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. Full Cost Method. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating 35 Table of Contents quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. As a requirement of our revolving credit facility, independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least 70% of the present value of our proved reserves. For December 31, 2006, the independent reserve engineers reports covered properties representing 83% of our proved reserves and 87% of the present value. For such properties, the reserves reported by the independent reserve engineers were within 3% of the reserves we reported. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. To increase our domestic DDA rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for 2006 would require a decrease in our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2005 of approximately 13 Bcfe. Due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools for the U.K., Malaysia and China, any decrease in reserves associated with the respective countrys full cost pool would significantly increase the DDA rate in that country. However, since production from our International operations represented less than 5% of our consolidated production for 2006, a change in our international DDA expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. However, the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. The full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting. Given the fluctuation of natural gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and oil prices decline, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. At December 31, 2006, the ceiling value of our domestic oil and gas reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $5.64 per MMBtu for gas and $61.05 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties would have exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $5 million (net of tax) at December 31, 2006. However, on February 22, 2007, the market price for gas (Gas Daily Henry Hub) increased to $7.48 per MMBtu and the market price for oil (Platts WTI at Cushing) decreased to $60.95 per barrel. Utilizing these prices, the unamortized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties would not have exceeded the ceiling amount at December 31, 2006. As a result, we did not record a writedown in the fourth quarter of 2006. The ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in the U.S. using the February 22, 2007 prices exceeded the net capitalized costs of those properties by approximately $900 million. 36 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in Malaysia, the U.K. and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the properties by approximately $68 million, $11 million and $19 million, respectively. Due to the relatively small size of these international pools, holding all other factors constant, if the applicable index for natural gas prices were to decline to approximately $4.80 per Mcf and or oil prices were to decline to approximately $50 per Bbl, it is possible that we could experience ceiling test writedowns in one or all of these international areas. Costs Withheld From Amortization. Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization. To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled). Incurred and future costs are allocated between completed and future work. Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2006, our domestic full cost pool had approximately $906 million of costs excluded from the amortization base, including $26 million associated with development costs for our deepwater Gulf of Mexico project known as Glider, located at Green Canyon 247/248. At December 31, 2006, capital costs not subject to amortization include $292 million related to our acquisition of the Monument Butte Field. Due to the significant size of the field, evaluation of the entire amount will require a number of years. Because the application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2006 (before considering the natural gas price increases experienced subsequent to year end) resulted in an excess of the carrying value of our domestic oil and gas properties over the cost center ceiling, inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base would have further increased the excess of the carrying value over the cost center ceiling. Utilizing commodity prices in effect as of February 22, 2007, the inclusion of some or all of these unevaluated property costs in our amortization base, without adding any associated reserves, would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. However, our future DDA rate would increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves. Future Development and Abandonment Costs. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis. 37 Table of Contents The accounting for future abandonment costs is set forth by SFAS No. 143. This standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future abandonment and development costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DDA expense. Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DDA expense. To increase our domestic DDA rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2006 would require an increase in the present value of our estimated future abandonment and development costs at December 31, 2005 of approximately $40 million. Due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in the U.K., Malaysia and China, any change in future abandonment or development costs associated with the respective countrys full cost pool would significantly change the DDA rate in that country. However, since production from our International operations represented less than 5% of our consolidated production for 2006, a change in our international DDA expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations As part of our growth strategy, we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain. The value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above. Goodwill of each reporting unit (each country is a separate reporting unit) is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. As there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated. If it is overstated, such impairment would reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill. We elected to make December 31 our annual assessment date. Commodity Derivative Activities We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production. To the extent that changes in the fair values of the cash flow hedges offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold. To the extent that changes in the fair values of the derivative exceed the changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the changes are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. Derivatives that do not qualify (such as three way collar contracts see Note 5, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements) or have not been designated as 38 Table of Contents cash flow hedges for hedge accounting are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the changes occur. Beginning on October 1, 2005, we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis, we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. In determining the amounts to be recorded for cash flow hedges, we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location. Where necessary, we adjust NYMEX prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices. Our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent, third party quotations. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123(R)) to account for stock based compensation. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. We elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options and other equity based compensation beginning in the first quarter of adoption. The determination of the fair value of an award requires significant estimates and subjective judgments regarding, among other things, the appropriate option pricing model, the expected life of the award and performance vesting criteria assumptions. As there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the fair value determinations, there is risk that the recorded stock compensation may not accurately reflect the amount ultimately earned by the employee. For years prior to 2006, we accounted for our stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method. Under this method, we recognized compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Please see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Standard In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under FIN 48, tax positions are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. These amounts are subsequently reevalvated and changes are recognized as adjustments to current period tax expense. FIN 48 also revises disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits. We are required to adopt FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. Upon adoption, we will be required to apply the provisions of FIN 48 to all tax positions and any cumulative effect adjustment will be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of FIN 48 and determined that its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 39 Table of Contents Regulation Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. An overview of this regulation is set forth below. We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business in Item 1A of this report. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price controls in the future. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation. The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, some aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final decisions. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERCs more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access, non discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction. Therefore, we do not believe that any FERC or MMS action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (2005 EPA). This comprehensive act contains many provisions that will encourage oil and gas exploration and development in the U.S. The 2005 EPA directs the FERC, MMS and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the 2005 EPA. We believe that neither the 2005 EPA nor the regulations promulgated, or to be promulgated, as a result of the 2005 EPA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Crude Oil. Our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products 40 Table of Contents are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other crude oil and condensate producers. Federal Leases. Most of our oil and gas leases in Utah and the Gulf of Mexico are granted by the federal government and administered by the MMS or the BLM, both federal agencies. MMS and BLM leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed BLM or MMS regulations and, in the case of offshore leases, orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject to change by the MMS). Many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease. Some stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the time during which activities on the lease may be conducted, the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or, in some cases, may ban surface activity. For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS approval for exploration, development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the BLM or the MMS, as applicable, prior to the commencement of drilling, and comply with regulations governing, among other things, engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of wells on the Shelf and removal of facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the BLM or the MMS, as applicable, may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The MMS regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases. The 2005 EPA formalizes the royalty in kind program of the MMS, providing that the MMS may take royalties in kind if the Secretary of the Interior determines that the benefits are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value. We believe that the MMS royalty in kind program will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In 2006, the MMS amended its regulations to require additional filing fees. The MMS has estimated that these additional filing fees will represent less than 0.1% of the revenues of companies with offshore operations in most cases. We do not believe that these additional filing fees will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. State and Local Regulation of Drilling and Production. We own interests in properties located onshore in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah. We also own interests in properties in state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. Environmental Regulations. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. The cost of compliance could be significant. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations, or the issuance of injunctive relief (including orders to cease operations). Environmental laws and 41 Table of Contents regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We also are subject to various environmental permit requirements. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. Moreover, some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate to the MMS that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and implementing MMS regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters. Since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters, we currently provide a total of $150 million in financial assurance to MMS. In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. The CWA prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to comply with the CWA, including discharge limits set by permits issued pursuant to the CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. The OPA and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention, control and countermeasure or SPCC plans. We have such plans in existence and are currently amending these plans or, as necessary, developing new SPCC plans that will satisfy new SPCC plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in July 2009. OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes certain environmental cleanup obligations. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also known as the EPA and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous 42 Table of Contents substance into the environment. Such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the Superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous state laws and common law obligations, and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and comparable state statutes restricts the emission of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain separate construction and operating permits before construction work can begin or operations may start, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. Also, the EPA has developed and continues to develop more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties. International Regulations. Our exploration and production operations outside the United States are subject to various types of regulations similar to those described above imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which we operate, and may affect our operations and costs within that country. We currently have operations in Malaysia, China and the United Kingdom. Forward Looking Information This report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures, the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, wells planned to be drilled in the future, our financing plans and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including: drilling results; oil and gas prices; well and waterflood performance; severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes); the prices of goods and services; the availability of drilling rigs and other support services; the availability of capital resources; and the other factors affecting our business described above under the caption Risk Factors. All written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. 43 Table of Contents Commonly Used Oil and Gas Terms Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and gas business. Basis risk. The risk associated with the sales point price for oil or gas production varying from the reference (or settlement) price for a particular hedging transaction. Barrel or Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume. Bcf. Billion cubic feet. Bcfe. Billion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil or condensate. BLM. The Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior. BOPD. Barrels of oil per day. Btu. British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one pound mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Carried interest. An arrangement under which an interest in oil and gas rights is assigned in consideration for the assignee advancing all or a portion of the funds to explore on, develop or operate an oil or gas property. Completion. The installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. Deep shelf. We consider the deep shelf to be structures located on the Shelf at depths generally greater than 14,000 feet in over pressured horizons where there has been limited or no production from deeper stratigraphic zones. Deepwater. Generally considered to be water depths in excess of 1,000 feet. Developed acreage. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production. Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas field to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. Dry hole or well. A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes. Exploitation well. An exploration well drilled to find and produce probable reserves. Most of the exploitation wells we drilled in 2005 and 2006 and expect to drill in 2007 are located in the Mid Continent or the Monument Butte Field. Exploitation wells in those areas have less risk and less reserve potential and typically may be drilled at a lower cost than other exploration wells. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we combine exploitation and development activities. Exploration well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas reserves that is not a development well. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we exclude exploitation activities from exploration activities. Farm in or farm out. An agreement whereunder the owner of a working interest in an oil and gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion thereof to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally, the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a farm in, while the interest transferred by the assignor is a farm out. FERC. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FPSO. A floating production, storage and off loading vessel commonly used overseas to produce oil from locations where pipeline infrastructure is not available. 44 Table of Contents Field.

Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production. Workover. Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 46 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. Oil and Gas Prices We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging in Item 7 of this report and Note 5, Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to our consolidated financial statements. Interest Rates At December 31, 2006, our current and long term debt was comprised of: Fixed Variable Rate Debt Rate Debt (In millions) Bank revolving credit facility $ $ 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007(1)(2) 75 50 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011(1) 125 50 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 325 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 550 Total current and long term debt $ 1,075 $ 100 (1) $50 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007 and $50 million principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011 are subject to interest rate swaps. These swaps provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments, and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes. (2) Classified as current debt on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because as of December 31, 2006 about 91% of our long term debt obligations, after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements, were at fixed rates. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10% change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be less than $1 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The British pound is the functional currency for our operations in the United Kingdom. The functional currency for all other foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2006. 47 Table of Contents
