Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and crude oil properties. Our domestic areas of operation include the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains, onshore Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we are active in Malaysia and China. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Oil and Gas Prices. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities. As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Reserve Replacement. To maintain and grow our production and cash flow, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. Significant Estimates. We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are: the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; the timing of future drilling, development and abandonment activities; the cost of these activities in the future; the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies; the value of our derivative positions; and the fair value of stock based compensation. Accounting for Hedging Activities. Beginning October 1, 2005, we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis, we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. Please see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Significant Transactions. We completed several significant transactions during 2007 that affect the comparability of our results from period to period and that had a meaningful impact on our 2007 results of operations and cash flows. In June 2007, we acquired Stone Energy Corporations Rocky Mountain assets for $578 million in cash. Initially, we financed this acquisition through borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. In August 2007, we sold our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets for $1.1 billion in cash and the purchasers assumption of liabilities associated with future abandonment of wells and platforms. In September 2007, we sold our coal bed methane assets in the Cherokee Basin of northeastern Oklahoma for $128 million in cash. In October 2007, we sold all of our interests in the U.K. North Sea for $511 million in cash. The historical results of operations of our U.K. North Sea subsidiaries are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations. This reclassification affects not only the 2007 presentation of our financial statements, but also the presentation of all prior period financial statements. Except where noted, discussions in this report relate to continuing operations only. Please see Note 3, Discontinued Operations, and Note 4, Oil and Gas Assets, to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report for a discussion regarding these transactions. Revenues. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production. The effects of the settlement of hedges designated for hedge accounting are included in revenues, but those not so designated have no effect on our reported revenues. None of our outstanding hedges are designated for hedge accounting. Please see Note 5, Commodity Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold. In addition, crude oil from our operations offshore Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated. Revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold, not when it is produced into the FPSO. As a result, the timing of liftings may impact period to period results. Revenues of $1.8 billion for 2007 were 7% higher than 2006 revenues due to higher oil production and higher oil prices partially offset by lower gas production and lower gas prices. Revenues of $1.7 billion for 2006 were 5% lower than 2005 revenues due to lower gas prices and oil production partially offset by higher oil prices and increased gas production. 25 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Production(1): United States: Natural gas (Bcf) 192.8 198.7 190.9 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 6,501 6,218 7,152 Total (Bcfe) 231.8 236.0 233.7 International: Natural gas (Bcf) Oil and condensate (MBbls) 2,258 1,097 1,294 Total (Bcfe) 13.5 6.6 7.8 Total: Natural gas (Bcf) 192.8 198.7 190.9 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 8,759 7,315 8,446 Total (Bcfe) 245.3 242.6 241.5 Average Realized Prices(2): United States: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 6.33 $ 6.47 $ 7.18 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 61.32 51.40 44.06 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 6.98 6.80 7.21 International: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ $ $ Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 69.21 56.58 55.68 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 11.53 9.43 9.28 Total: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 6.33 $ 6.47 $ 7.18 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 63.35 52.18 45.84 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 7.23 6.87 7.27 (1) Represents volumes lifted and sold regardless of when produced. (2) Average realized prices only include the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting. Had we included the effects of contracts not so designated, our average realized price for total gas would have been $7.62, $7.22 and $6.65 per Mcf for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $55.04, $50.25 and $44.36 per Bbl for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Without the effects of any hedging contracts, our average realized prices for 2007, 2006 and 2005 would have been $6.33, $6.42 and $7.54 per Mcf, respectively, for gas and $64.12, $59.13 and $53.36 per barrel, respectively, for oil. Domestic Production. Our 2007 domestic gas and oil production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) decreased 2% from 2006. Our 2007 natural gas production decreased 3% primarily as a result of the sale of our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets in August 2007. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in production in the Mid Continent as a result of successful drilling efforts and in the Rocky Mountains as a result of our acquisition there in June 2007. Our 2006 Gulf of Mexico production was negatively impacted (16 Bcfe) by production deferrals related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Our domestic oil and condensate production increased 5% over 2006 primarily due to increased sales from our Monument Butte field. Our 2006 domestic gas and oil production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) increased slightly over 2005. Our 2006 domestic natural gas production increased 4% over 2005 primarily as the result of 26 Table of Contents successful drilling efforts in the Mid Continent partially offset by continued Gulf of Mexico production deferrals during the first half of 2006 related to the 2005 storms and natural declines in production from some fields. Our 2006 domestic oil and condensate production decreased 13% over 2005. The decrease was primarily the result of continued Gulf of Mexico production deferrals during the first half of 2006 related to the 2005 storms and natural declines in production from some fields. International Production. Our 2007 international oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas equivalent basis) increased 106% from 2006 primarily due to the commencement of liftings in China in August 2006 and from our Abu field in Malaysia in July 2007 and the timing of liftings in Malaysia and China. Our 2006 international oil and gas production decreased 15% from 2005 due to the timing of liftings of oil production in Malaysia. Operating Expenses. We believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production, or per Mcfe, basis. Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2007. Unit of Production Amount Year Ended Percentage Year Ended Percentage December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2007 2006 (Decrease) 2007 2006 (Decrease) (Per Mcfe) (In millions) United States: Lease operating $ 1.21 $ 1.11 9 % $ 281 $ 261 7 % Production and other taxes 0.31 0.21 48 % 73 49 48 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.78 2.59 7 % 643 611 5 % General and administrative 0.65 0.49 33 % 150 116 31 % Other (0.04 ) 100 % (11 ) 100 % Total operating expenses 4.95 4.36 14 % 1,147 1,026 12 % International: Lease operating $ 2.41 $ 2.22 9 % $ 33 $ 15 123 % Production and other taxes 2.10 1.77 19 % 28 12 143 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.85 1.96 45 % 39 13 199 % General and administrative 0.35 0.44 (20 )% 5 2 64 % Ceiling test writedown 0.94 (100 )% 6 (100 )% Total operating expenses 7.71 7.33 5 % 105 48 116 % Total: Lease operating $ 1.28 $ 1.14 12 % $ 314 $ 276 14 % Production and other taxes 0.41 0.25 64 % 101 61 67 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.78 2.57 8 % 682 624 9 % General and administrative 0.63 0.48 31 % 155 118 32 % Ceiling test writedown 0.03 (100 )% 6 (100 )% Other (0.04 ) 100 % (11 ) 100 % Total operating expenses 5.10 4.43 15 % 1,252 1,074 17 % 27 Table of Contents Domestic Operations. Our total domestic operating expenses for 2007, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 14% over 2006. The period to period change was primarily related to the following items: Lease operating expense (LOE) in 2007 was adversely impacted by higher operating costs for all of our operations and ongoing repair expenditures of $52 million ($0.22 per Mcfe) related to the 2005 storms. The increase was offset by the sale of all of our producing properties in the shallow water Gulf of Mexico in August 2007, which properties have relatively high LOE per Mcfe. Without the impact of the repair expenditures related to the 2005 storms, our 2007 LOE would have been $0.99 per Mcfe. Our 2006 LOE was negatively impacted by the difference ($0.07 per Mcfe) between insurance proceeds received from the settlement of claims related to the 2005 storms and actual repair expenditures during 2006. Without the impact of the costs related to the repairs for the 2005 storms in excess of our insured amounts, our 2006 LOE would have been $1.04 per Mcfe. Production and other taxes increased $0.10 per Mcfe because of an increase in the proportion of our production subject to taxes as a result of increased production from our Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain operations and the Gulf of Mexico property sale. In addition, during 2006, we recorded refunds of $18 million ($0.07 per Mcfe) related to production tax exemptions on certain high cost gas wells, compared to refunds of only $8 million ($0.04 per Mcfe) recorded during 2007. The increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions, offset by the proceeds from the Gulf of Mexico property sale and the sale of our coal bed methane assets in the Cherokee Basin. The component of DDA associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was $0.04 per Mcfe for 2007 and $0.06 per Mcfe for 2006. The decrease in accretion expense is due to the significant reduction in our asset retirement obligation resulting from the Gulf of Mexico property sale. Please see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements. General and administrative (GA) expense increased $0.16 per Mcfe in 2007 due to additional bonus expense of $17 million ($0.07 per Mcfe) under our incentive compensation plan associated with the gain from the sale of our interests in the U.K. North Sea, an increase in a litigation settlement reserve associated with a statewide royalty owner class action lawsuit in Oklahoma and continued growth in our workforce. During 2007, we capitalized $49 million ($0.21 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $40 million ($0.17 per Mcfe) in 2006. Capitalized direct internal costs in 2007 include $5 million ($0.02 per Mcfe) related to additional bonus expense associated with the U.K. North Sea sale. Other expenses for 2006 include the following items: In 2006, we redeemed all $250 million principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. We recorded a charge for the $19 million early redemption premium we paid and a charge of $8 million for the remaining unamortized original issuance costs for the notes. In 2006, we recorded a $37 million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage relating to the disruptions to our operations caused by the 2005 storms. International Operations. Our international operating expenses for 2007, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 5% compared to 2006. The period to period change was primarily related to the following items: Total LOE increased significantly due to increased liftings in Malaysia and China during 2007. LOE, on an Mcfe basis, increased 9% due to higher operating costs for our international operations. Production and other taxes increased $0.33 per Mcfe primarily due to an increase in the tax rate per unit for our oil in Malaysia as a result of substantially higher oil prices. The DDA rate increased as a result of higher costs for drilling goods and services in Malaysia. GA expense decreased $0.09 per Mcfe primarily due to increased liftings of production in Malaysia and China. 28 Table of Contents In 2006, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $6 million associated with ceasing our exploration efforts in Brazil. Year ended December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2006. Unit of Production Amount Year Ended Percentage Year Ended Percentage December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) 2006 2005 (Decrease) (Per Mcfe) (In millions) United States: Lease operating $ 1.11 $ 0.81 37 % $ 261 $ 190 38 % Production and other taxes 0.21 0.25 (16 )% 49 58 (15 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.59 2.18 19 % 611 510 20 % General and administrative 0.49 0.43 14 % 116 101 14 % Other (0.04 ) (0.12 ) (67 )% (11 ) (29 ) (63 )% Total operating expenses 4.36 3.55 23 % 1,026 830 24 % International: Lease operating $ 2.22 $ 1.89 17 % $ 15 $ 15 Production and other taxes 1.77 0.83 113 % 12 6 81 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.96 1.34 46 % 13 10 24 % General and administrative 0.44 0.05 780 % 2 1 644 % Ceiling test writedown 0.94 1.24 (24 )% 6 10 (35 )% Total operating expenses 7.33 5.35 37 % 48 42 16 % Total: Lease operating $ 1.14 $ 0.85 34 % $ 276 $ 205 35 % Production and other taxes 0.25 0.26 (4 )% 61 64 (5 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.57 2.15 20 % 624 520 20 % General and administrative 0.48 0.42 14 % 118 102 15 % Ceiling test writedown 0.03 0.04 (25 )% 6 10 (35 )% Other (0.04 ) (0.12 ) (67 )% (11 ) (29 ) (63 )% Total operating expenses 4.43 3.60 23 % 1,074 872 23 % Domestic Operations. Our domestic operating expenses for 2006, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 24% over 2005. The period to period change was primarily related to the following items: LOE increased due to higher operating costs for all of our operations and significantly higher insurance costs for our Gulf of Mexico operations. Additionally, 2006 LOE was negatively impacted by the difference ($0.07 per Mcfe) between insurance proceeds received from the settlement of all claims related to the 2005 storms and actual repair expenditures during 2006. Without the impact of this difference, our LOE would have been $1.04 per Mcfe for 2006. Production and other taxes decreased primarily due to refunds of $18 million ($0.07 per Mcfe) related to production tax exemptions on certain of our onshore high cost gas wells in Texas. The increase in our DDA rate resulted from higher cost reserve additions. The cost of reserve additions was adversely impacted by escalating costs of drilling goods and services experienced during 29 Table of Contents 2006. The component of DDA associated with accretion expense related to our asset retirement obligation was $0.06 per Mcfe for 2006 and 2005. GA expense increased approximately $0.06 per Mcfe primarily due to stock based compensation expense recognized as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Please see Note 10, Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements. The increase attributable to stock based compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense as a result of lower adjusted net income (as defined in our incentive compensation plan) in 2006 as compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives. During 2006, we capitalized $40 million ($0.17 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $38 million ($0.17 per Mcfe) in 2005. Other expenses for 2006 and 2005 include the following items: In 2006, we redeemed all $250 million principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. We recorded a charge for the $19 million early redemption premium we paid and a charge of $8 million for the remaining unamortized original issuance costs for the notes. In 2006, we recorded a $37 million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage relating to the disruptions to our operations caused by the 2005 storms. In 2005, we recorded a $22 million benefit from our business interruption insurance coverage and sold our interest in the floating production system and related equipment we acquired in the EEX transaction for a net gain of $7 million. International Operations. Our international operating expenses for 2006, stated on an Mcfe basis, increased 37% over 2005. The increase was primarily related to the following items: LOE increased because our production in Malaysia decreased while total LOE remained relatively unchanged. Our Malaysian LOE primarily consists of fixed costs related to our FPSOs. Production and other taxes increased as a result of higher realized crude oil prices. The DDA rate increased as a result of higher cost reserve additions in Malaysia and the commencement of liftings of oil production in China in August 2006. GA expense increased due to stock compensation expense recognized as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and growth in our international workforce. We recorded a ceiling test writedown of $6 million associated with ceasing our exploration efforts in Brazil in 2006. In 2005, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $10 million associated with our decreased emphasis on exploration efforts in Brazil and in other non core international regions. Interest Expense. The following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Gross interest expense $ 102 $ 87 $ 72 Capitalized interest (47 ) (44 ) (46 ) Net interest expense $ 55 $ 43 $ 26 The increase in gross interest expense in 2007 resulted primarily from higher average debt levels outstanding under our credit arrangements as compared to 2006. Prior to the sale of our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets, we financed our capital shortfall and the acquisition of Stone Energys Rocky Mountain assets with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements. Following the sale, we repaid all of our 30 Table of Contents outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements and $125 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes that became due in October 2007. The increase in gross interest expense in 2006 resulted primarily from the April 13, 2006 issuance of $550 million principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016, partially offset by the May 3, 2006 redemption of $250 million principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. Commodity Derivative Income (Expense). The following table presents information about the components of commodity derivative income (expense) for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Cash flow hedges: Hedge ineffectiveness(1) $ $ 5 $ (8 ) Other derivative contracts: Realized loss on settlement of discontinued cash flow hedges(2) (51 ) Unrealized gain (loss) due to change in fair market value(3) (365 ) 249 (202 ) Realized gain (loss) on settlement 177 135 (61 ) Total commodity derivative income (expense) $ (188 ) $ 389 $ (322 ) (1) Hedge ineffectiveness is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. (2) In the third quarter of 2005, as a result of the production deferrals experienced in the Gulf of Mexico related to the storms, hedge accounting was discontinued on a portion of our contracts that had previously qualified as effective cash flow hedges of our Gulf of Mexico production and other contracts were redesignated as hedges of our onshore Gulf Coast production. As a result, realized losses of $51 million associated with derivative contracts for the third and fourth quarters of 2005, which were in excess of hedged physical deliveries for those periods, were reported as commodity derivative expense. (3) The unrealized gain (loss) due to changes in fair market value is associated with our derivative contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting and represents changes in the fair value of these open contracts during the period. Taxes. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 41%, 36% and 37%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was more than the federal statutory tax rate for all three years primarily due to state income taxes and the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates. Our effective tax rate for 2007 increased because $26 million of interest income on intercompany loans to our international subsidiaries was included in the determination of U.S. federal income taxes. However, the related intercompany interest expense was incurred by several of our international subsidiaries that are located in non taxing international jurisdictions. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices, the timing and amount of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow production and cash flow. We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and the acquisition of properties. These activities require substantial capital expenditures. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year. Our 2008 capital budget currently exceeds expected cash flow from operations and cash and short term investments on hand at year end 2007 by approximately $260 million. We anticipate that the shortfall will be made up with cash and short term investments on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements. In the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. To the extent that we increase our capital budget during 2008, we anticipate funding these amounts with borrowings under our credit arrangements. 31 Table of Contents Credit Arrangements. In June 2007, we entered into a new revolving credit facility that matures in June 2012 and provides for initial loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase as agent. The loan commitments may be increased to a maximum of $1.65 billion if the existing lenders increase their loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the facility. Subject to compliance with covenants in our credit facility that restrict our ability to incur additional debt, we also have a total of $135 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions. For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements, please see Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report. At February 28, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility nor under our money market lines of credit and we had approximately $1.4 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements. Working Capital. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments. Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital because our capital spending generally has exceeded our cash flows from operations and we generally use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements. At December 31, 2007, we had a working capital deficit of $2 million. Our current assets include $370 million of cash and short term investments remaining from the proceeds of property sales. Our working capital position at December 31, 2007 was positively affected by a reduction in our asset retirement obligation of $30 million due to the sale of our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets. At December 31, 2007, our working capital deficit included a short term net derivative liability of $84 million. This compares to a working capital deficit of $272 million at the end of 2006 and $129 million at the end of 2005. The majority of the working capital deficit at December 31, 2006 relates to the reclassification of $125 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes due October 15, 2007 as a current liability and an increase in accrued liabilities as a result of our significant capital activities near the end of 2006. The increase in accrued liabilities is due to our increased exploration and development activity and higher service costs over 2005. Our 2006 working capital deficit also includes $40 million in asset retirement obligations compared to $47 million in 2005. Our 2006 working capital includes a short term net derivative asset of $200 million and our 2005 working capital includes a short term net derivative liability of $89 million. Cash Flows from Operations. Cash flows from operations (both continuing and discontinued) are primarily affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital. We also have experienced fluctuations in operating cash flows as a result of higher operating costs for all of our operations and activities associated with the 2005 storms. In August 2006, we reached an agreement with our insurance underwriters to settle all claims related to the 2005 storms (business interruption, property damage and control of well/operators extra expense) for $235 million. During 2007, we incurred $52 million of repair expenditures in excess of the insurance benefits received as compared to $17 million of uninsured repairs during 2006. These amounts are reflected as a use of operating cash flows in the respective year. We sell substantially all of our natural gas and oil production under floating market contracts. However, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months. See Oil and Gas Hedging below. We typically receive the cash associated with accrued oil and gas sales within 45 60 days of production. As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations is impacted by changes in working capital and is not affected by DDA, writedowns or other non cash charges or credits. Our net cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion in 2007, a decrease of 17% compared to net cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion in 2006. Although our 2007 production volumes were impacted by our property sales, higher commodity prices offset the cash flow impact of the property sales. Realized oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis), including the effects of hedging contracts (regardless of whether 32 Table of Contents designated for hedge accounting), increased 7% over 2006. Our working capital requirements during 2007 increased compared to 2006 as a result of increased drilling activities, the timing of payments made by us to vendors and other operators, and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operators. Our net cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in 2006, a 25% increase over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to 2006 realized oil and gas prices (on a natural gas equivalent basis), including the effects of hedging contracts (regardless of whether designated for hedge accounting), which increased 9% over 2005. See Results of Operations above. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities (both continuing and discontinued) for 2007 was $906 million compared to $1.7 billion for 2006. During 2007, we: spent $2.6 billion (including $658 million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties); received proceeds of $1.3 billion from sales of U.S. oil and gas properties ($1.1 billion from our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets, $128 million from our coal bed methane assets in the Cherokee Basin of Oklahoma and $125 million from various other oil and gas properties); received proceeds of $491 million (net of cash on hand at the date of sale) for the sale of our interests in the U.K. North Sea; and purchased short term investments of $271 million and redeemed short term investments of $172 million. During 2006, we: spent $1.6 billion; received insurance recoveries of $45 million; and purchased short term investments of $714 million and redeemed short term investments of $690 million. Capital Expenditures. Our capital spending of $2.6 billion for 2007 increased 51% from our $1.7 billion of capital spending during 2006. These amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of $21 million in 2007 and $11 million in 2006. Of the $2.6 billion spent in 2007, we invested $1.4 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $240 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $736 million in acquisitions and domestic leasehold activity (including $578 million for the Rocky Mountain asset acquisition) and $236 million internationally. Our 2006 capital spending of $1.7 billion increased 61% from our 2005 capital spending of $1.1 billion. These amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of $11 million in 2006 and $44 million in 2005. During 2006, we invested $1.2 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $379 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $71 million in other domestic leasehold activity and $133 million internationally. We budgeted $1.6 billion for capital spending in 2008, excluding acquisitions and $113 million of estimated capitalized interest and overhead. Approximately 40% of the $1.6 billion is allocated to the Mid Continent, 20% to the Rocky Mountains, 15% to the onshore Gulf Coast, 15% to the Gulf of Mexico and 10% to international projects. See Item 1, Business Our Properties and Plans for 2008. Since our 2008 capital budget currently exceeds forecasted net cash flow from operations, we plan to make up the shortfall with cash and short term investments on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including the extent to which properties are acquired, drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. Depending on the timing of an acquisition, we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties. 33 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash flow used in financing activities (both continuing and discontinued) for 2007 was $79 million compared to $317 million of net cash flow provided by financing activities for 2006. During 2007, we: borrowed and repaid $2.9 billion under our credit arrangements; repaid $125 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes at their maturity in October 2007; received proceeds of $32 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options; and received a $14 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. During 2006, we: issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016; used the proceeds from the notes to redeem $250 million principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012; borrowed and repaid $519 million under our credit arrangements; received proceeds of $15 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options; and received a $5 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options.

We have work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data and fulfilling other cash commitments. At December 31, 2007, these work related commitments totaled $7 million and were comprised of $3 million in the United States and $4 million internationally. These amounts are not included by maturity because their timing cannot be accurately predicted. 34 Table of Contents Credit Arrangements. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements above for a description of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. Senior Notes. In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. The indenture also provides that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. During the third quarter of 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes (see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8, Debt Interest Rate Swaps, to our consolidated financial statements). Senior Subordinated Notes. In August 2004, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. In April 2006, we issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016. Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of our 65/8% notes due 2014 at any time on or after September 1, 2009 and some or all of our 65/8% notes due 2016 at any time on or after April 15, 2011, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes. We also may redeem all but not part of our 65/8% notes due 2014 prior to September 1, 2009 and all but not part of our 65/8% notes due 2016 prior to April 15, 2011, in each case, at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, before April 15, 2009, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of our 65/8% notes due 2016 with net cash proceeds from certain sales of our common stock at 106.625% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets. 35 Table of Contents Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements. Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. Oil and Gas Hedging As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Approximately 87% of our 2007 production was subject to derivative contracts (including basis contracts). In 2006, 57% of our production was subject to derivative contracts, compared to 81% in 2005. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. Historically, a majority of our hedged natural gas and crude oil production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges. With the sale of the Gulf of Mexico shelf production and the corresponding shift in the geographic distribution of our natural gas production, we have begun to utilize basis hedges to a greater extent. The price that we receive for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically averages $0.40 $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for our Mid Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 75 85% of the Henry Hub Index. In light of potential basis risk with respect to our newly acquired Rocky Mountain assets, we have hedged the basis differential for about 50% of our estimated production from proved producing fields acquired from Stone Energy through 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted average of $1.18 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index. The price we receive for our Gulf Coast oil production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price we receive for our oil production in the Rocky Mountains is currently averaging about $13 $15 per barrel below the WTI price. Oil production from the Mid Continent typically sells at a $1.00 $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil sales from our operations in Malaysia typically sell at Tapis, which generally is consistent with WTI. Oil sales from our operations in China typically sell at $10 $12 per barrel less than WTI. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2007, Barclays Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank N.A., J Aron Company, Bank of Montreal and Credit Suisse were the counterparties with respect to 84% of our future hedged production. Between January 1, 2008 and February 25, 2008, we entered into the additional derivative contracts set forth below. None of these contracts have been designated for hedge accounting. 36 Table of Contents Natural Gas NYMEX Contract Price per MMBtu Collars Swaps Additional Put Floors Ceilings Floors Volume in (Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Period and Type of Contract MMMBtus Average) Range Average Range Average Range Average Range Average April 2008 June 2008 Floor contracts 5,460 $8.58 $8.70 $8.64 July 2008 September 2008 Floor contracts 5,520 8.58 8.70 8.64 October 2008 December 2008 Price swap contracts 610 $9.00 Collar contracts 2,440 $8.00 $8.00 $10.20 $10.70 $10.38 Floor contracts 1,860 8.58 8.70 8.64 3 Way collar contracts 4,880 $7.00 $7.50 $7.19 8.00 9.00 8.63 11.72 13.80 12.95 January 2009 December 2009 Price swap contracts 8,390 8.47 Collar contracts 5,740 8.00 8.00 8.97 10.70 9.86 3 Way collar contracts 7,200 7.00 7.50 7.19 8.00 9.00 8.63 11.72 13.80 12.95 In addition, in February 2008 we paid $14.6 million to unwind and rehedge 360 MBbls of our oil contracts for January 2010 through December 2010. The three way collar contracts that we unwound had weighted average prices of $32.00 and $50.88 per barrel for the floor and ceiling prices, respectively. These contracts had an additional put with a weighted average price of $25.00 per barrel. We rehedged these barrels for this period with a weighted average swap price of $93.40 per barrel. Please see the discussion and tables in Note 5, Commodity Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program and a listing of open contracts as of December 31, 2007 and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of that date. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described above under Contractual Obligations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting 37 Table of Contents Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of derivative positions. Stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments. Oil and Gas Activities. Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. Full Cost Method. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change 38 Table of Contents substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of DDA expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. To increase our domestic DDA rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for 2007 would have required a decrease in our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2006 of approximately 13 Bcfe. Due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools for Malaysia and China, any decrease in reserves associated with the respective countrys full cost pool would significantly increase the DDA rate in that country. However, since production from our international operations represented only about 6% of our consolidated production for 2007, a change in our international DDA expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower DDA expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. The full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting. Given the fluctuation of natural gas and oil prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and oil prices decline, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. At December 31, 2007, the ceiling value of our domestic oil and gas reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of $6.80 per MMBtu for gas and $96.01 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. Using these prices, the ceiling exceeded the net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties by approximately $1.9 billion (net of tax) at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the properties by approximately $117 million and $70 million, respectively. Holding all other factors constant, if the applicable index for oil prices were to decline to approximately $70 per Bbl, it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in Malaysia. It is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in China if the applicable index for oil prices were to decline to approximately $55 per Bbl, holding all other factors constant. Costs Withheld From Amortization. Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment 39 Table of Contents requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization. To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled). Incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work. Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2007, our domestic full cost pool had approximately $1.1 billion of costs excluded from the amortization base. Because the application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2007 resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our domestic oil and gas properties, inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base, without adding any associated reserves, would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. However, our future DDA rate would increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves. Future Development and Abandonment Costs. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates. The accounting for future abandonment costs is set forth by SFAS No. 143. This standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DDA expense. Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DDA expense. To increase our domestic DDA rate by $0.01 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2007 would require an increase in the present value of our estimated future development and abandonment costs at December 31, 2006 of approximately $38 million. Due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in Malaysia and China, a change greater than $30 million and $9 million, respectively, in future development or abandonment costs associated with the respective countrys full cost pool would increase the DDA rate in that country by 10%. However, since production from our international operations represented only about 6% of our consolidated production for 2007, a change in our international DDA expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations. As part of our growth strategy, we actively pursue acquisitions of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair 40 Table of Contents value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain. The value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above. The accounting for business combinations will change in 2009. Please see New Accounting Standards below for a detailed discussion. Goodwill of each reporting unit (each country is a separate reporting unit) is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated cash flows. As there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated. If it is overstated, such impairment would reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill. We elected to make December 31 our annual assessment date. Commodity Derivative Activities. We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 12 24 months. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production. To the extent that changes in the fair values of the cash flow hedges offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold. To the extent that changes in the fair values of the derivative exceed the changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the changes are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. Derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the changes occur. Beginning on October 1, 2005, we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis, we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. In determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative. Our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the NYMEX, over the counter quotations, volatility and the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent, third party quotations. Stock Based Compensation. On January 1, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123(R)), Share Based Payment, to account for stock based compensation. Among other items, SFAS No. 123(R) eliminated the use of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and the intrinsic value 41 Table of Contents method of accounting and requires companies to recognize in their financial statements the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. We elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options and other equity based compensation beginning in the first quarter of adoption. For all unvested options outstanding as of January 1, 2006, the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair value at the original grant date, has been or will be recognized in our financial statements over the remaining vesting period. For equity based compensation awards granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2006, compensation expense, based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification, has been or will be recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period. We utilize the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice based model for our performance and market based restricted shares. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we followed the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 to account for stock based compensation. See Note 10, Stock Based Compensation, for a full discussion of our stock based compensation. New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes criteria to be considered when measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB granted a one year deferral of the effective date of this statement as it applies to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (e.g. those measured at fair value in a business combination and goodwill impairment). This statement is effective for all recurring measures of financial assets and financial liabilities (e.g. derivatives and investment securities) for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will adopt the provisions of this statement for all recurring measures of financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of SFAS No. 157 as it relates to our financial assets and liabilities and determined that its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose in the financial statements. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. Regulation Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. An overview of this regulation is set forth below. We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business in Item 1A of this report. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas. Our sales of natural gas are affected directly or indirectly by the availability, terms and cost of natural gas transportation. The prices and terms for access to pipeline transportation of natural gas are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations. 42 Table of Contents The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access, non discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction. Therefore, we do not believe that any FERC or MMS action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (2005 EPA). This comprehensive act contains many provisions that will encourage oil and gas exploration and development in the U.S. The 2005 EPA directs the FERC, MMS and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the 2005 EPA. The 2005 EPA also increased civil and criminal penalties for any violations of the NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and any rules, regulations or orders of the FERC up to $1 million per day per violation. The FERC issued a final rule effective January 26, 2006 that makes it unlawful for any entity, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or transportation service subject to the FERCs jurisdiction, to defraud, make an untrue statement or omit a material fact or engage in any practice, act or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud. These changes resulting from the 2005 EPA have significantly expanded and strengthened oversight of natural gas markets. We believe, however, that neither the 2005 EPA nor the regulations promulgated, or to be promulgated, as a result of the 2005 EPA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. The current statutory and regulatory framework governing interstate natural gas transactions is subject to change in the future, and the nature of such changes is impossible to predict. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. In the past, the federal government regulated the prices at which gas could be sold. Congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. There is always some risk, however, that Congress may reenact price controls in the future. Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action the FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. Federal Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Crude Oil. Our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other crude oil and condensate producers. Federal Leases. Our oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico and many of our leases in the Rocky Mountains are granted by the federal government and administered by the MMS or the BLM, both federal agencies. MMS and BLM leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed BLM or MMS regulations and, in the case of offshore leases, orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are subject to change by the MMS). Many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease. Some stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the time during which activities on the lease may be conducted, the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or, in some cases, may ban surface activity. For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS approval for exploration, development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the BLM or the MMS, as applicable, prior to the commencement of drilling, and comply with regulations governing, among other things, engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of wells on the Shelf and removal of facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees 43 Table of Contents have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain circumstances, the BLM or the MMS, as applicable, may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The MMS regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases. The 2005 EPA formalizes the royalty in kind program of the MMS, providing that the MMS may take royalties in kind if the Secretary of the Interior determines that the benefits are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value. We believe that the MMSs royalty in kind program will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. In 2006, the MMS amended its regulations to require additional filing fees. The MMS has estimated that these additional filing fees will represent less than 0.1% of the revenues of companies with offshore operations in most cases. We do not believe that these additional filing fees will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete. State and Local Regulation of Drilling and Production. We own interests in properties located onshore in a number of states and in state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana. Please see the table under Acreage Data in Item 2 of this report. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some states have the power to prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas. Environmental Regulations. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. The cost of compliance could be significant. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations, or the issuance of injunctive relief (including orders to cease operations). Environmental laws and regulations are complex, and have tended to become more stringent over time. We also are subject to various environmental permit requirements. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. Moreover, some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. The Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by 44 Table of Contents OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate to the MMS that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and implementing MMS regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and at least $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters. In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. The CWA prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to comply with the CWA, including discharge limits set by permits issued pursuant to the CWA, may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. The OPA and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention, control and countermeasure or SPCC plans. We have such plans in existence and are currently amending these plans or, as necessary, developing new SPCC plans that will satisfy new SPCC plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in July 2009. OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes certain environmental cleanup obligations. Although RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also known as the EPA, and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the Superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years. Many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous state laws and common law obligations, and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties, including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators, or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and comparable state statutes restrict the emission of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain separate construction and operating permits before construction work can begin or operations may start, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. Also, the EPA has developed and continues to develop more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. 45 Table of Contents The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties. International Regulations. Our exploration and production operations outside the United States are subject to various types of regulations similar to those described above imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which we operate, and may affect our operations and costs within that country. We currently have operations in Malaysia and China. Forward Looking Information This report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures, future drilling plans and programs, expected production rates, the availability and source of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, our financing plans and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that these expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including: drilling results; oil and gas prices; the prices of goods and services; the availability of drilling rigs and other support services; the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil we produce from our Monument Butte field; the availability of capital resources; labor conditions; severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes); and the other factors affecting our business described above under the caption Risk Factors. All written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. Commonly Used Oil and Gas Terms Below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and gas business. Basis risk. The risk associated with the sales point price for oil or gas production varying from the reference (or settlement) price for a particular hedging transaction. Barrel or Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume. Bcf. Billion cubic feet. Bcfe. Billion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil or condensate. BLM. The Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior. BOPD. Barrels of oil per day. Btu. British thermal unit, which is the heat required to raise the temperature of a one pound mass of water from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit. 46 Table of Contents Completion. The installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas. Deepwater. Generally considered to be water depths in excess of 1,000 feet. Developed acreage. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production. Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas field to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. Dry hole or well. A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes. Exploitation well. An exploration well drilled to find and produce probable reserves. Most of the exploitation wells we drilled in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and expect to drill in 2008 are located in the Mid Continent or the Monument Butte field. Exploitation wells in those areas have less risk and less reserve potential and typically may be drilled at a lower cost than other exploration wells. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we combine exploitation and development activities. Exploration well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas reserves that is not a development well. For internal reporting and budgeting purposes, we exclude exploitation activities from exploration activities. Farm in or farm out. An agreement whereunder the owner of a working interest in an oil and gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion thereof to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally, the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a farm in, while the interest transferred by the assignor is a farm out. FERC. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FPSO. A floating production, storage and off loading vessel commonly used overseas to produce oil from locations where pipeline infrastructure is not available. Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition. Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells in which we own a working interest. Infill drilling or infill well. A well drilled between known producing wells to improve oil and natural gas reserve recovery efficiency. MBbls. One thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. Mcf. One thousand cubic feet. Mcfe. One thousand cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil or condensate. MMS. The Minerals Management Service of the United States Department of the Interior. MMBbls. One million barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. MMBtu. One million Btus. Net acres or net wells. The sum of the fractional working interests we own in gross acres or gross wells, as the case may be. NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange. Probable reserves. Reserves which analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data does not demonstrate to be proved under current technology and existing economic conditions, but where such analysis suggests the likelihood of their existence and future recovery. 47 Table of Contents Productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes. Promoted drilling. An agreement where under the owner of this type of interest in the drilling of a well incurs a disproportionate share of costs associated with the well until the well is drilled and completed. Proved developed producing reserves. Proved developed reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals currently open in existing wells and capable of production to market. Proved developed reserves. In general, proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The SEC provides a complete definition of proved developed reserves in Rule 4 10(a)(3) of Regulation S X. Proved developed nonproducing reserves. Proved developed reserves expected to be recovered from zones behind casing in existing wells. Proved reserves. In general, the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The SEC provides a complete definition of proved reserves in Rule 4 10(a)(2) of Regulation S X. Proved undeveloped reserves. In general, proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. The SEC provides a complete definition of proved undeveloped reserves in Rule 4 10(a)(4) of Regulation S X. Reserve life index. This index is calculated by dividing total proved reserves at year end by annual production to estimate the number of years of remaining production. Shelf. The U.S. Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Water depths generally range from 50 feet to 1,000 feet. Tcfe. One trillion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil or condensate. Unconventional resource plays. Plays targeting tight sand, coal bed or gas shale reservoirs. The reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete hydrocarbon water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs. These reservoirs generally require stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to produce economically. Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Waterflood. A secondary recovery operation in which water is injected into the producing formation in order to maintain reservoir pressure and force oil toward and into the producing wells. Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production. Workover. Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 48 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. Oil and Gas Prices We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. We use hedging to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Interest Rates At December 31, 2007, our debt was comprised of: Fixed Variable Rate Debt Rate Debt (In millions) Bank revolving credit facility $ $ 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011(1) 125 50 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 325 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 550 Total current and long term debt $ 1,000 $ 50 (1) $50 million principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011 is subject to interest rate swaps. These swaps provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments, and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes. We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because a substantial majority, about 95%, of our long term debt obligations, after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements, were at fixed rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2007. 49
