Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties. Our domestic areas of operation include the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains, onshore Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we are active in Malaysia and China. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Oil and Gas Prices. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and the accounting for our oil and gas activities including among other items, the determination of ceiling test writedowns. Any extended decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital. Please see the discussion under Lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in Item 1A of this report and Liquidity and Capital Resources below. As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs. Reserve Replacement. To maintain and grow our production and cash flow, we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced. Please see Proved Reserves below and Supplementary Financial Information Supplementary Oil and Gas Disclosures Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves in Item 8 of this report for the change in our total net proved reserves during the three year period ended December 31, 2009. Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves. See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Proved and Probable Reserves Proved Reserves. Significant Estimates. We believe the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are: the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; the timing of future drilling, development and abandonment activities; the cost of these activities in the future; the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies; the fair value of our financial instruments including derivative positions; and the fair value of stock based compensation. 33 Table of Contents Accounting for Hedging Activities. We do not designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience, significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2009, we had net derivative assets of $281 million, of which 57% was measured based upon our valuation model (i.e. Black Scholes) and, as such, is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. We value these contracts using a model that considers various inputs including (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments. We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties. Please see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities below and Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 8, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts. Results of Operations Significant Events. We completed several significant transactions during 2008 and 2007 and recorded ceiling test writedowns under the full cost method of accounting at the end of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, each of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows from period to period. As of December 31, 2008, we recorded a $1.8 billion ceiling test writedown. We recorded an additional $1.3 billion ceiling test writedown as of March 31, 2009. During the first six months of 2008, we entered into a series of transactions that had the effect of resetting all of our then outstanding crude oil hedges for 2009 and 2010. At the time of the reset, the mark to market value of these hedge contracts was a liability of $502 million and we paid an additional $56 million to purchase option contracts. In October 2007, we sold all of our interests in the U.K. North Sea for $511 million in cash. The historical results of operations of our U.K. North Sea operations are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations. Except where noted, discussions in this report relate to continuing operations only. In August 2007, we sold our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets for $1.1 billion in cash and the purchasers assumption of liabilities associated with future abandonment of wells and platforms. In June 2007, we acquired Stone Energy Corporations Rocky Mountain assets for $578 million in cash. Initially, we financed this acquisition through borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Please see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Oil and Gas Properties, Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Note 4, Oil and Gas Assets, and Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report for a discussion regarding these events. Revenues. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production. The effects of the settlement of hedges designated for hedge accounting are included in revenue, but those not so designated have no effect on our reported revenues. None of our outstanding oil and gas hedging contracts as of December 31, 2009 are designated for hedge accounting and the settlement of all hedging contracts during 2009 and 2008 had no effect on reported revenues. However, revenues for 2007 include losses on the settlement of hedging contracts designated for hedge accounting of $7 million. Please see Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold. In addition, crude oil from our operations offshore Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated. Revenues are 34 Table of Contents recorded when oil is lifted and sold, not when it is produced into the FPSO. As a result, the timing of liftings may impact period to period results. Revenues of $1.3 billion for 2009 were 40% lower than 2008 revenues due to significantly lower average realized oil and gas prices partially offset by higher oil and gas production. Revenues of $2.2 billion for 2008 were 25% higher than 2007 revenues due to increased oil production and higher average realized prices for oil and gas partially offset by lower natural gas production. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Production(1): Domestic: Natural gas (Bcf) 174.3 172.9 192.8 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 7,059 6,136 6,501 Total (Bcfe) 216.7 209.8 231.8 International: Natural gas (Bcf) Oil and condensate (MBbls) 6,120 4,439 2,258 Total (Bcfe) 36.7 26.6 13.5 Total: Natural gas (Bcf) 174.3 172.9 192.8 Oil and condensate (MBbls) 13,179 10,575 8,759 Total (Bcfe) 253.4 236.4 245.3 Average Realized Prices(2): Domestic: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 3.48 $ 7.65 $ 6.33 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 51.19 86.84 61.32 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 4.47 8.85 6.98 International: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ $ $ Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 59.72 82.03 69.21 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 9.95 13.67 11.53 Total: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 3.48 $ 7.65 $ 6.33 Oil and condensate (per Bbl) 55.15 84.82 63.35 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 5.28 9.39 7.23 (1) Represents volumes lifted and sold regardless of when produced. (2) Average realized prices only include the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we applied hedge accounting to qualifying derivatives, and the last of our previously designated cash flow hedges settled during 2007. Had we included the effects of hedging contracts not designated for hedge accounting, our average realized price for total natural gas would have been $6.42, $7.12 and $7.62 per Mcf for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $81.23, $69.13 and $55.04 per Bbl for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Without the effects of any hedging contracts designated for hedge accounting, our 2007 average realized prices would have been $6.33 per Mcf for natural gas and $64.12 per Bbl for oil. All amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 exclude the cash payments totaling $502 million to reset our 2009 and 2010 crude oil hedges. 35 Table of Contents Domestic Production. Our 2009 domestic oil and gas production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased 3% over 2008 production primarily due to increased production in our Mid Continent division as a result of continued successful drilling efforts, partially offset by natural field declines and the voluntary curtailment of approximately 3 Bcfe of production during the second half of 2009 from our Mid Continent division due to low natural gas prices. Our 2008 domestic oil and gas production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, decreased 9% from 2007 production, primarily as a result of the sale of our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets in August 2007. In addition, 2008 production was negatively impacted by the deferral of approximately 5 Bcfe of production related to the 2008 hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Production from our June 2007 acquisition of Stone Energy Corporations Rocky Mountain assets partially offset the impact of the hurricanes. Without the impact of the Gulf of Mexico asset sale and the Rocky Mountain asset acquisition, our total 2008 oil and gas production increased 20% over 2007 due to increased production in our Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain divisions as a result of continued successful drilling efforts. International Production. Our 2009 international oil production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased 38% over 2008 production primarily due to new field developments on PM 318 and PM 323 in Malaysia and the timing of liftings from our oil production in Malaysia. Our 2008 international oil production increased 97% over 2007 production primarily due to new field developments on PM 323 in Malaysia. Operating Expenses. We believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production, or per Mcfe, basis. However, because of the previously noted significant events during 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the year over year increases in our international production, period to period comparisons are difficult. For example, offshore Gulf of Mexico properties typically have significantly higher lease operating costs relative to onshore properties and offshore production is not subject to production taxes but onshore production is subject to these taxes. 36 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2009. Unit of Production Total Amount Year Ended Percentage Year Ended Percentage December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) 2009 2008 (Decrease) (Per Mcfe) (In millions) Domestic: Lease operating $ 0.94 $ 1.00 (6 )% $ 203 $ 210 (4 )% Production and other taxes 0.15 0.29 (48 )% 33 60 (46 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.14 2.84 (25 )% 463 597 (22 )% General and administrative 0.64 0.65 (2 )% 139 136 2 % Ceiling test and other impairments 6.20 8.54 (27 )% 1,344 1,792 (25 )% Other 0.03 0.02 50 % 8 4 124 % Total operating expenses 10.10 13.34 (24 )% 2,190 2,799 (22 )% International: Lease operating $ 1.53 $ 2.05 (25 )% $ 56 $ 55 3 % Production and other taxes 0.82 3.64 (77 )% 30 97 (69 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3.39 3.77 (10 )% 124 100 24 % General and administrative 0.14 0.18 (22 )% 5 5 12 % Ceiling test writedown 2.66 (100 )% 71 (100 )% Total operating expenses 5.88 12.30 (52 )% 215 328 (34 )% Total: Lease operating $ 1.02 $ 1.12 (9 )% $ 259 $ 265 (2 )% Production and other taxes 0.25 0.66 (62 )% 63 157 (60 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.32 2.95 (21 )% 587 697 (16 )% General and administrative 0.57 0.60 (5 )% 144 141 2 % Ceiling test and other impairments 5.30 7.88 (33 )% 1,344 1,863 (28 )% Other 0.03 0.01 200 % 8 4 124 % Total operating expenses 9.49 13.22 (28 )% 2,405 3,127 (23 )% Domestic Operations. Our domestic operating expenses for 2009, stated on a Mcfe basis, decreased 24% over 2008 primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded at December 31, 2008 and the magnitude of the full cost ceiling test writedowns recorded at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009. The components of the period to period change are as follows: Lease operating expense (LOE) decreased 6% per Mcfe due to lower overall operating and service costs and the 3% increase in production volumes period over period. Production and other taxes decreased 48% per Mcfe due to significantly lower realized commodity prices period over period. We received refunds of $24 million ($0.11 per Mcfe) during 2009 related to production tax exemptions on some of our onshore wells, whereas we received similar refunds of $35 million ($0.17 per Mcfe) during 2008. Our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA) rate decreased 25% per Mcfe primarily as a result of the ceiling test writedowns recorded at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009. General and administrative (GA) expense per Mcfe decreased 2% period over period while total GA expense increased slightly. The decrease per Mcfe is primarily due to the 3% increase in production volumes period over period. The slight increase in total GA is primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with our growing domestic workforce offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense, which is calculated based on adjusted net income (as defined in our incentive 37 Table of Contents compensation plan). Adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excluded (a) unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and (b) the impact from any full cost ceiling test writedowns. Additionally, we match the costs/benefits of the 2008 crude oil hedge unwind/reset with the period in which these barrels are produced for the purposes of determining adjusted net income. During 2009, we capitalized $58 million ($0.27 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $49 million ($0.23 per Mcfe) in 2008. In 2009, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.3 billion ($6.20 per Mcfe) due to significantly lower natural gas prices at March 31, 2009. In 2008, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.7 billion ($8.25 per Mcfe) due to significantly lower oil and gas commodity prices at year end 2008. In 2008, we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $62 million ($0.29 per Mcfe) due to the significant decline in oil and gas commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization at that time. Other expenses for 2009 primarily includes long term rig contract termination fees resulting from our decision to limit our 2009 capital expenditures to a level that we expected to be funded with cash flows from operations. Other expenses for 2008 includes the reversal of a portion of accrued business interruption insurance claims related to 2005 Hurricane Ivan which were determined during 2008 to be uncollectible. International Operations. Our international operating expenses for 2009, stated on a Mcfe basis, decreased 52% over the same period of 2008 primarily due to the 2008 full cost ceiling test writedown in Malaysia and significantly higher production taxes during 2008 due to substantially higher oil prices. The components of the period to period change are as follows: LOE decreased 25% per Mcfe while total LOE increased slightly over 2008. The decrease in LOE per Mcfe is primarily due to increased production volumes associated with the new field developments on PM 318 and PM 323 in Malaysia and lower overall operating and service costs. Production and other taxes decreased significantly due to substantially lower realized oil prices during 2009. Total DDA expense increased 24% primarily due to additional production volumes and the timing of liftings of these volumes associated with new field developments on PM 318 and PM 323 in Malaysia, partially offset by a decrease in the DDA rate resulting from the 2008 Malaysia ceiling test writedown. GA expense decreased 22% per Mcfe primarily due to the 38% increase in production volumes in 2009. In 2008, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $71 million associated with our operations in Malaysia due to significantly lower oil prices at year end 2008. 38 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2008.

Our domestic operating expenses for 2008, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 169% over 2007 due primarily to a 2008 full cost ceiling test writedown and goodwill impairment charge. The components of the period to period change are as follows: LOE decreased 17% per Mcfe due to the sale of our shallow water Gulf of Mexico properties in August 2007, which had relatively high LOE per Mcfe. Our 2007 LOE was adversely impacted by repair expenditures of $52 million ($0.22 per Mcfe) related to the 2005 storms. Without the impact of the repair expenditures related to the 2005 storms, our 2007 LOE would have been $0.99 per Mcfe. The decrease in LOE was partially offset by higher operating costs in 2008 for all our operations. Production and other taxes decreased 6% per Mcfe due to refunds of $35 million ($0.17 per Mcfe) related to production tax exemptions on some of our onshore wells recorded during 2008 compared to refunds of $8 million ($0.04 per Mcfe) recorded during 2007. The benefit of the refunds was partially offset by increased commodity prices and increased production from our Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain operations, which are subject to production taxes, and the sale of our Gulf of Mexico properties, which were not subject to production taxes. 39 Table of Contents Our DDA rate increased 2% per Mcfe while total DDA expense decreased 7% period over period primarily due to the sale of our Gulf of Mexico properties in August 2007. The increase in the DDA rate per Mcfe was due to higher cost reserve additions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in accretion expense due to the significant reduction in our asset retirement obligation following the sale of our Gulf of Mexico properties. GA expense per Mcfe remained flat period over period while total GA expense decreased 9% over 2007. The decrease in total GA expense was primarily due to a 2007 litigation settlement reserve associated with a statewide royalty owner class action lawsuit in Oklahoma which was partially offset by increased employee related expenses in 2008 due to our increased domestic workforce. During 2008, we capitalized $49 million ($0.23 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $49 million ($0.21 per Mcfe) in 2007. In 2008, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.7 billion ($8.25 per Mcfe) due to significantly lower oil and gas commodity prices at year end 2008. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $62 million ($0.29 per Mcfe) due to the significant decline in oil and gas commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization at that time. Other expenses for 2008 includes the reversal of a portion of accrued business interruption insurance claims related to 2005 Hurricane Ivan which were determined during 2008 to be uncollectible. International Operations. Our international operating expenses for 2008, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 60% over the same period of 2007 primarily due to higher production taxes and a full cost ceiling test writedown in Malaysia. The components of the period to period change are as follows: LOE decreased 15% per Mcfe while total LOE increased 68% over 2007. The decrease on a per unit basis resulted from increased liftings in Malaysia. The increase in total LOE was primarily due to new field developments on PM 318 and PM 323 and higher operating costs in Malaysia. Production and other taxes increased significantly in 2008 due to an increase in the tax rate per unit for our oil lifted and sold in Malaysia as a result of substantially higher oil prices during 2008. The DDA rate in 2008 increased as a result of higher cost reserve additions in Malaysia. GA expense decreased 49% per Mcfe primarily due to increased production in Malaysia during 2008. In 2008, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $71 million associated with our operations in Malaysia due to significantly lower oil prices at year end 2008. Interest Expense. The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Gross interest expense: Credit arrangements $ 8 $ 10 $ 14 Senior notes 12 13 23 Senior subordinated notes 102 87 59 Other 4 2 6 Total gross interest expense 126 112 102 Capitalized interest (51 ) (60 ) (47 ) Net interest expense $ 75 $ 52 $ 55 The increase in gross interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008, and 2008 as compared to 2007, resulted primarily from the May 2008 issuance of $600 million principal amount of our 71/8% Senior 40 Table of Contents Subordinated Notes due 2018. In October 2007, we repaid $125 million principal amount of our 7.45% Senior Notes. We capitalize interest with respect to our unproved properties. Capitalized interest during 2009 decreased as compared to 2008 due to a reduction in our unproved property base resulting from the evaluation of such leasehold acreage. Interest capitalized during 2008 increased over 2007 due to an increase in our unproved property base primarily as a result of the Rocky Mountain asset acquisition in June 2007. Commodity Derivative Income (Expense). The significant fluctuation in commodity derivative income (expense) from year to year is due to the extreme volatility of oil and gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these years. Taxes. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 39%, 30% and 41%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was different than the federal statutory tax rate for all three years primarily due to deductions that do not generate tax benefits, state income taxes and the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates. Our effective tax rate for 2009 increased because we released the valuation allowance related to the tax benefit associated with the Malaysia ceiling test writedown recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our effective tax rate for 2008 decreased from 2007 because during 2008 we were not able to recognize the full tax benefit associated with the $71 million ceiling test writedown in Malaysia and the $62 million goodwill impairment charge did not generate a tax benefit. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices, the timing, amount, and location of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flow. We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and the acquisition of properties. These activities require substantial capital expenditures. Lower prices for oil and gas may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce, and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, as further described below. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year. Our 2010 capital budget is $1.6 billion and focuses on projects we believe will generate and lay the foundation for production growth. Our 2010 capital budget (excluding acquisitions) is guided by our anticipated 2010 cash flows. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired. In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. We have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations. On January 25, 2010, we sold $700 million of 67/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 and received net proceeds of $686 million. These notes were issued at 99.109% of par to yield 7%. We used $294 million of the net proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, $215 million to fund the acquisition of assets from TXCO Resources Inc. and we tendered for approximately $143 million of our outstanding 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. We continue to hold auction rate securities with a fair value of $40 million. We attempt to sell these securities every 7 28 days until the auctions succeed, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature. We currently do not believe that the decrease in the fair value of these investments is permanent nor that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity given the amount of our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements. See Note 8, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the auction rate securities. 41 Table of Contents Credit Arrangements. We have a revolving credit facility that matures in June 2012 and provides for loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of more than 15 financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank as agent. As of December 31, 2009, the largest commitment was 16% of total commitments. However, the amount that we can borrow under the facility could be limited by changing expectations of future oil and gas prices because the maximum amount that we may borrow under the facility is determined by our lenders annually each May (and may be adjusted at the option of our lenders in the case of certain acquisitions or divestitures) using a process that takes into account the value of our estimated reserves and hedge position and the lenders commodity price assumptions. In the future, total commitments under the facility could be increased to a maximum of $1.65 billion if the existing lenders increase their individual loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the facility. We do not believe we could access such additional capacity in the current credit market. In addition, subject to compliance with covenants in our credit facility that restrict our ability to incur additional debt, we also have a total of $120 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions. For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements, please see Note 9, Debt , to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. At February 22, 2010, we had $1 million of undrawn letters of credit and outstanding borrowings of $75 million under our $1.25 billion credit facility. Our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately $1.3 billion as of February 22, 2010. Working Capital. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments. Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. Although we anticipate that our 2010 capital spending (excluding acquisitions) will correspond with our anticipated 2010 cash flows, we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from operations do not necessarily match. At December 31, 2009, we had positive working capital of $20 million. The decrease in our working capital balance as compared to December 31, 2008 is primarily due to a $396 million decrease in net derivative assets and their related deferred taxes resulting from the settlement of contracts during 2009, partially offset by the timing of receivable collections from purchasers, payments made by us to vendors and other operators, and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations. At December 31, 2008, we had positive working capital of $121 million. During 2008, we used $271 million of cash and short term investments on hand at the beginning of 2008 to fund a portion of our capital program and reclassified $75 million of our auction rate securities from short term to long term investments. In addition, at December 31, 2008, we had a net derivative asset of $663 million compared to a net derivative liability of $84 million at December 31, 2007. These working capital increases were partially offset by a change in our net current deferred tax position. Our net current deferred tax position was a liability of $226 million at December 31, 2008 compared to an asset of $35 million at December 31, 2007. Cash Flows from Operations. Cash flows from operations (both continuing and discontinued) are primarily affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our oil and gas production under floating price market sensitive contracts. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months. See Oil and Gas Hedging below. We typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within 45 60 days of production. As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by DDA, ceiling test writedowns, other impairments, or other non cash charges or credits. Our net cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in 2009, an increase of 85% compared to net cash flow from operations of $854 million in 2008. This increase is primarily due to cash receipts related to 42 Table of Contents derivative settlements of $883 million during 2009 compared to cash payments of $750 million during 2008. The cash payments in 2008 included $558 million to reset our 2009 and 2010 crude oil hedging contracts effectively settling the liability on our balance sheet at that time. Our 2009 net cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by lower average realized commodity prices during the year. Our working capital requirements during 2009 increased compared to 2008 as a result of the timing of drilling activities, receivable collections from purchasers, payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations. Our net cash flow from operations was $854 million in 2008, a decrease of 26% compared to net cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion in 2007. This decrease is primarily due to the $558 million paid in 2008 to reset our 2009 and 2010 crude oil hedging contracts. Even though our 2008 production volumes were impacted by our 2007 property sales, the impact of this transaction on net cash flows from operations was somewhat offset by higher average realized commodity prices during 2008, increased production from our Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain divisions and increased liftings in Malaysia. Our working capital requirements during 2008 decreased compared to 2007 as a result of the timing of drilling activities, receivable collections from purchasers, payments made by us to vendors and other operators, and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 was $1.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion for 2008. During 2009, we: spent $1.4 billion (including $9 million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties); received proceeds of $33 million from sales of oil and gas properties; and redeemed investments of $20 million. During 2008, we: spent $2.3 billion (including $223 million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties); and purchased investments of $22 million and redeemed investments of $70 million. Capital Expenditures. Our capital spending of $1.4 billion for 2009 decreased 38% from our $2.3 billion of capital spending during 2008. These amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of $19 million in 2009 and $15 million in 2008. Of the $1.4 billion spent in 2009, we invested $937 million in domestic exploitation and development, $181 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $147 million in acquisitions of proved and unproved property (leasehold) and domestic leasing activity and $148 million outside the United States. Our capital spending of $2.3 billion for 2008 decreased 13% from our $2.6 billion of capital spending during 2007. These amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of $15 million in 2008 and $21 million in 2007. Of the $2.3 billion spent in 2008, we invested $1.3 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $352 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $363 million in acquisitions (includes the acquisition of properties in South Texas) and domestic leasing activity and $225 million outside the United States. We have budgeted $1.6 billion for capital spending in 2010, including $124 million of estimated capitalized interest and overhead. Approximately 40% of the $1.6 billion is initially allocated to the Mid Continent, 23% to the Rocky Mountains, 14% to the Gulf of Mexico, 10% to onshore Texas, and 13% to international projects. See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Our Properties and Plans for 2010. The 2010 capital budget is based on our expectation that we will live within anticipated cash flow from operations (excluding acquisitions). Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired. In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. 43 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for 2009 was $168 million compared to $1.2 billion of net cash provided by financing activities for 2008. During 2009, we: borrowed $1.0 billion and repaid $1.2 billion under our credit arrangements; and received proceeds of $9 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options. During 2008, we: borrowed $2.6 billion and repaid $2.0 billion under our credit arrangements; issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 71/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 and paid $8 million in associated debt issue costs; and received proceeds of $20 million from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options. Proved Reserves To maintain and grow our production and cash flow, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced. The following is a discussion of proved reserves, reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves. 2009 2008 2007 (Bcfe) Proved Reserves: Beginning of year 2,950 2,496 2,272 Reserve additions 1,342 758 881 Reserve revisions (384 ) (67 ) (12 ) Sales (35 ) (2 ) (396 ) Production (257 ) (235 ) (249 ) End of year 3,616 2,950 2,496 Proved Developed Reserves: Beginning of year 1,827 1,566 1,484 End of year 1,908 1,827 1,566 Our proved natural gas reserves at year end 2009 were 2.6 Tcf compared to 2.1 Tcf at year end 2008 and 1.8 Tcf at year end 2007. Our proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year end 2009 were 169 million barrels compared to 140 million barrels at year end 2008 and 114 million barrels at year end 2007. Natural gas comprised about 72%, 72% and 73% of our proved reserves at year end 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Reserve Additions and Revisions. During 2009, we added 958 Bcfe net proved reserves as a result of additions (extensions, discoveries, improved recovery and purchases of reserves in place) and revisions, as described below. Of this amount, 693 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves primarily associated with our Woodford Shale and Monument Butte fields was the result of the changes in SEC reserves reporting rules expanding proved undeveloped reserves beyond one offset to a proved developed location. We expect the majority of future reserve additions to be associated with infill drilling, extensions of current fields and new discoveries, as well as improved recovery operations and purchases of proved properties. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. Additions. We added 1,342 Bcfe proved reserves during 2009, approximately 521 Bcfe of which were the result of successful development drilling in our Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain business units. During 2008, we added 758 Bcfe of proved reserves, approximately 599 Bcfe of which were as a result of successful drilling efforts in the Mid Continent and Rocky Mountains. During 2007, we added 881 Bcfe of proved reserves. Of this amount, 519 Bcfe was related to successful development drilling in our Mid Continent and 44 Table of Contents Onshore Gulf Coast business units and approximately 198 Bcfe was related to our purchase of reserves in place primarily associated with the acquisition of Stone Energys Rocky Mountain assets in June 2007. Revisions. Total revisions in 2009 were a negative 384 Bcfe, or 13% of the beginning of year reserve base. The revisions included a negative price revision of 259 Bcfe primarily related to our onshore natural gas plays, such as the Woodford Shale, and were primarily proven undeveloped reserves. The remaining 125 Bcfe of revisions in 2009 were negative performance revisions and were principally proved developed producing reserve revisions. Total revisions for 2008 were a negative 67 Bcfe and were primarily price related domestic revisions associated with the decrease in both oil and gas prices from 2007 to 2008. Total revisions for 2007 were a negative 12 Bcfe and were primarily performance revisions associated with our Onshore Gulf Coast properties. Sales. During 2009, we sold approximately 35 Bcfe of reserves associated with our domestic operations. In 2008, sales of reserves were negligible. Substantially all the 396 Bcfe of sales of oil and gas reserves during 2007 were related to our shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets and our coal bed methane assets in the Cherokee Basin of Oklahoma. Future Net Cash Flows. At December 31, 2009, the present value (discounted at 10%) of estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves was $2.9 billion (stated in accordance with the regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This present value was calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month oil and gas prices for the prior twelve months held flat for the life of the reserves. This amount is unchanged from the $2.9 billion at December 31, 2008 despite lower natural gas prices utilized to calculate 2009 proved reserves. Reserve quantity additions as a result of our drilling success during 2009 coupled with the additional reserve quantities recognized as a result of the SECs new reserves rules offset the impact of the lower natural gas prices utilized to calculate 2009 proved reserves. The decrease of $1.6 billion, or 35%, in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily due to lower commodity prices at year end 2008. See Supplementary Financial Information Supplementary Oil and Gas Disclosures Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves under Item 8 of this report. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of our proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money to the evaluating party and the perceived risks inherent in producing oil and gas. 45 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations by maturity as of December 31, 2009. Less than More than Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Debt: Revolving credit facility $ 384 $ $ 384 $ $ 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011 175 175 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 325 325 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 550 550 71/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 600 600 Total debt 2,034 559 325 1,150 Other obligations: Interest payments(1) 738 118 215 201 204 Net derivative liabilities (assets) (281 ) (267 ) (14 ) Asset retirement obligations 92 10 13 9 60 Operating leases 127 63 20 18 26 Deferred acquisition payments 2 2 Firm transportation 233 31 59 58 85 Oil and gas activities(2) 508 Total other obligations 1,419 (43 ) 293 286 375 Total contractual obligations $ 3,453 $ (43 ) $ 852 $ 611 $ 1,525 (1) Interest associated with our revolving credit facility was calculated using a weighted average interest rate of 1.125% at December 31, 2009 and is included through the maturity of the facility. (2) As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. We have work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, natural gas transportation, and fulfilling other cash commitments. At December 31, 2009, these work related commitments totaled $508 million and were comprised of $380 million in our domestic business and $128 million internationally. Our domestic obligation relates to a 10 year firm transportation agreement for our Mid Continent production. This obligation is subject to the completion of construction, which is expected during the second quarter of 2010, and upon required regulatory approvals. Actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted. As of December 31, 2009, we have delivery commitments through 2011 to deliver to third party purchasers approximately 100,000 MMBtu of our daily production, principally from our Mid Continent division. Given the size of our proved natural gas reserves and production capacity in our Mid Continent division, we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these delivery commitments. See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties for a description of our Mid Continent production and proved reserves. Credit Arrangements. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements above for a description of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. Senior Notes In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption 46 Table of Contents price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. The indenture also provides that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. On February 19, 2010, we announced that we had accepted for purchase and payment approximately $143 million of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011 pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation that we began January 20, 2010. We funded the tender offer with a portion of the proceeds from our January 25, 2010 issuance of $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 67/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020. See Note 19, Subsequent Events, to our consolidated financial statements. Senior Subordinated Notes In August 2004, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. The net proceeds from the offering were $323 million. In April 2006, we issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016. The net proceeds from the offering were $545 million. In May 2008, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 71/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018. We received net proceeds from the offering of $592 million. Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of our 65/8% notes due 2014 at any time on or after September 1, 2009 and some or all of our 65/8% notes due 2016 at any time on or after April 15, 2011, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes. We also may redeem all but not part of our 65/8% notes due 2016 prior to April 15, 2011, at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. We may redeem some or all of our 71/8% notes at any time on or after May 15, 2013 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes. Prior to May 15, 2013, we may redeem all, but not part, of our 71/8% notes at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, before May 15, 2011, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of our 71/8% notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 107.125% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; 47 Table of Contents engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets. On January 25, 2010, we sold $700 million of 67/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 and received net proceeds of $686 million. These notes were issued at 99.109% of par to yield 7%. We used $294 million of the net proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, $215 million to fund the acquisition of assets from TXCO Resources Inc. and we tendered for approximately $143 million of our outstanding 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements. Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. Oil and Gas Hedging As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. As of February 22, 2010, approximately 64% of our estimated 2010 production was subject to derivative contracts (including basis contracts). In 2009, 85% of our production was subject to derivative contracts, compared to 72% in 2008 and 87% in 2007. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables and receivables from separate hedging arrangements with that counterparty. At December 31, 2009, Barclays Capital, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Credit Suisse Energy LLC, Credit Agricole Corporate Investment Bank London Branch, J Aron Company and Societe Generale were the counterparties with respect to 82% of our future hedged production, none of which were counterparty to more than 25% of our future hedged production. A significant number of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements also are lenders under our credit facility. Our credit facility, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations. None of our derivative contracts contain collateral posting requirements; however, two of our derivative contracts contain a provision that would permit the counterparty, in certain circumstances, to request adequate assurance of our performance under the contract. 48 Table of Contents Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. Historically, a majority of our hedged oil and gas production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges. The price that we receive for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically averages $0.25 $0.50 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index. Realized natural gas prices for our Mid Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 85 90% of the Henry Hub Index. In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 15 Bcf of our natural gas production from January 2010 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted average of $0.95 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index. In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtus per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.95 per MMBtu. In the Mid Continent, we hedged basis associated with approximately 12 Bcf of our anticipated Stiles/Britt Ranch natural gas production from January 2010 through August 2011. In total, this hedge and the 30,000 MMBtus per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.52 per MMBtu. We have also hedged basis associated with approximately 23 Bcf of our natural gas production from this area for the period September 2011 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu. The price we receive for our Gulf Coast oil production typically averages about 90 95% of the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price we receive for our oil production in the Rocky Mountains is currently averaging about $12 $14 per barrel below the WTI price. Oil production from our Mid Continent properties typically averages 80 85% of the WTI price. Oil sales from our operations in Malaysia typically sell at a slight discount to Tapis, or about 90 95% of WTI. Oil sales from our operations in China typically sell at $4 $6 per barrel less than the WTI price. Please see the discussion and tables in Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program, a listing of open contracts as of December 31, 2009 and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of that date. Between January 1, 2010 and February 22, 2010, we did not enter into additional derivative contracts. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described above under Contractual Obligations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting 49 Table of Contents Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions. Stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments. Oil and Gas Activities. Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, costs in effect at year end and a 10% discount rate. On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Final Rule). The Final Rule adopts revisions to the SECs oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on Forms 10 K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009. On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010 03), which aligns the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932), with the requirements in the SECs Final Rule. We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010 03 effective December 31, 2009. The following critical accounting policies and estimates discussions have been updated to reflect the new rules unless stated otherwise. See New Accounting Requirements below for a full discussion. Full Cost Method. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development costs, are amortized on a 50 Table of Contents unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Proved Oil and Gas Reserves. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials and under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of DDA expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. To change our domestic DDA rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 4%, or 140 Bcfe. To change our Malaysia DDA rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in Malaysia of approximately 3%, or 5 Bcfe. Since production from our China operations is immaterial, any change in the DDA rate as a result of changes in our proved reserves in China would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower DDA expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. The ceiling value of oil and gas reserves is calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter. The full cost ceiling test impairment calculation also takes into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting, if any. At December 31, 2009, the ceiling value of our oil and gas reserves was calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of $3.87 per MMBtu for natural gas and $61.14 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. Based on these prices, the cost center ceilings with respect to our properties in the U.S., Malaysia and China exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective properties. As such, no ceiling test writedowns were required. Holding all other factors constant, if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months for oil or gas were to decline approximately 5% from prices used at December 31, 2009, it is possible we could experience a domestic full cost ceiling test writedown. Holding all other factors constant, it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in Malaysia and China if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month oil price declined approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, from prices used at December 31, 2009. At March 31, 2009, prior to our adoption of the Final Rule and ASU 2010 03, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period end market prices of $3.63 per MMBtu for natural gas and 51 Table of Contents $49.65 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties at March 31, 2009 exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.3 billion ($854 million, after tax), resulting in a ceiling test writedown. Given the fluctuation of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term. If the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months decline, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. Costs Withheld From Amortization. Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. In addition, a portion of incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization. To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled). Incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work. Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2009, we had a total of approximately $1.2 billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools. The application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2009 resulted in an excess of the cost center ceilings over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for each full cost pool. Holding all other factors constant, inclusion of approximately 15% of our unevaluated property costs in our domestic amortization base would have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. Future Development and Abandonment Costs. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates. The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. 52 Table of Contents Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DDA expense. Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DDA expense. To change our domestic DDA rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 10%, or $265 million. To change our Malaysia DDA rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in Malaysia of approximately 8%, or $17 million. Since production from our China operations is immaterial, any change in the DDA rate as a result of changes in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in China would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations. As part of our growth strategy, we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain. The value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above. The accounting for business combinations changed effective January 1, 2009 and established how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition, measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction. The standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December 31, 2008. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2009. Commodity Derivative Activities. We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production. Beginning in late 2005, we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis, we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty and subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. In determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative. Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry standard models that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent, third party quotations. 53 Table of Contents The determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests). We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties. Stock Based Compensation. We apply a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. For equity based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification, and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period. We utilize the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice based model for our performance and market based restricted stock. See Note 11, Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock based compensation. New Accounting Requirements In September 2006, the FASB defined fair value, established criteria to be considered when measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance is effective for all recurring measures of financial assets and liabilities (e.g. derivatives and investment securities) for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We adopted the provisions for all recurring measures of financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance, which granted a one year deferral of the effective date as it applies to non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (e.g. those measured at fair value in a business combination and asset retirement obligations). Beginning January 1, 2009, we applied the provisions to non financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB established how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The standard also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose in the financial statements. The standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of the standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations, but may have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for businesses we acquire post adoption. In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures about our derivative and hedging activities that is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted the disclosure requirements beginning January 1, 2009. Please see Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The adoption did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which makes fair value measurements more consistent with fair value principles, enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures, and provides greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities. The additional guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions for the period ending March 31, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2009, the FASB established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. Although there is new terminology, the guidance is based on the same principles as those that previously existed. This guidance is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. Our adoption of 54 Table of Contents these provisions beginning with the period ending June 30, 2009 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued the Final Rule. The Final Rule adopts revisions to the SECs oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on Form 10 K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009. The revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies. The amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology. On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 03, which aligns the FASBs oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SECs Final Rule. We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010 03 effective December 31, 2009 as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate. Such a change is accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance. Comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of ASU 2010 03 and the Final Rule are not required. Our adoption of ASU 2010 03 and the Final Rule on December 31, 2009 impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2009, as follows: All oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with prior periods. This change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at December 31, 2009 using the updated reserves rules, which require use of the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates. Under the previous reserve estimation rules, which are no longer in effect, our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices. In addition, the new rules permit us to disclose probable reserves (and we have so disclosed probable reserves), which was not permitted under previous rules. Our full cost ceiling test calculations at December 31, 2009 used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves, which were calculated using the updated reserves rules. We historically have applied a policy of using our year end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate. As a result, the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or prior years. Due to the extent of our domestic and international oil and gas activities and the limited time interval allowed for preparing our annual report on Form 10 K, it was not practical to prepare estimates of oil and gas reserves using end of period prices and to generate discounted cash flow models for estimates of proved reserves using both the previous rules and the new rules. Therefore, it was not practical to quantify the volumetric impact of the change in reserves rules and methodology or the impact, if any, on our full cost ceiling test or depletion rate. Regulation Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations. An overview of these regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Regulation. We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. In addition, potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, in Item 1A of this report. 55 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. Oil and Gas Prices We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months as part of our risk management program. In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. We use hedging to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging in Item 7 of this report and the discussion and tables in Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. Interest Rates At December 31, 2009, our debt was comprised of: Fixed Variable Rate Debt Rate Debt (In millions) Bank revolving credit facility $ $ 384 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011(1) 125 50 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 325 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 550 71/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 600 Total debt $ 1,600 $ 434 (1) $50 million principal amount of our 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011 is subject to an interest rate swap. The swap provides for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments, and is designated as a fair value hedge of a portion of our outstanding senior notes. On January 25, 2010, we sold $700 million of 67/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 and received net proceeds of $686 million. These notes were issued at 99.109% of par to yield 7%. We used $294 million of the net proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, $215 million to fund the acquisition of assets from TXCO Resources Inc. and we tendered for approximately $143 million of our outstanding 75/8% Senior Notes due 2011. As a result, substantially all of our debt is at fixed rates as of February 22, 2010. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flow, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2009. 56 Table of Contents
