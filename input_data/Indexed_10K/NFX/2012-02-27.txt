Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Our principal domestic areas of operation include the Mid Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore Texas. Internationally, we focus on offshore oil developments in Malaysia and China. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas prices affect: the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures; our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; and the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce. To maintain and grow our production and cash flows, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Operational Highlights. Significant 2011 operational highlights include the following: In May 2011, we closed two separate transactions in the Central Basin (north and adjacent to Monument Butte) for approximately $303 million and added approximately 65,000 net acres, giving us interest in approximately 230,000 net acres in the Uinta Basin; In late 2011 and early 2012, we announced two separate, long term agreements (7 and 10 years, respectively) with area refiners adding 38,000 BOPD of refining capacity beginning in 2013 and 2014; By year end 2011, we had assembled more than 125,000 net acres in the oily Cana Woodford play, located in the Anadarko Basin; and Production commenced in late 2011 from two new offshore developments in Malaysia East Piatu and Puteri, which are now providing combined net production of approximately 11,000 BOEPD as of February 15, 2012. Financial Highlights. Significant 2011 financial highlights include the following: For 2011, we had revenues of $2.5 billion, 31% higher than 2010; For 2011, we recorded net income of $539 million, or $3.99 per diluted share; Production for the full year of 2011 was 293 Bcfe, an increase of 3% over 2010 production volumes; Oil and liquids production grew more than 20% over 2010 levels and comprised 40% of our total production; At year end 2011, our proved reserves were 3.9 Tcfe and probable reserves were 2.6 Tcfe, which reflects growth of 5% and 4%, respectively, over the prior year; During 2011, our proved oil reserves increased nearly 30% and proved natural gas reserves declined by 6% when compared to year end 2010; Our oil liftings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were 6 million barrels, or an average of approximately 64,000 BOPD, which is approximately 9,000 BOPD higher than the third quarter of 2011 and approximately 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010; and During 2011, we monetized approximately $406 million in sales of non strategic assets and executed contracts to monetize an additional $335 million. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Revenues. All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production and do not include the effects of the settlements of our hedges. Please see Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold. In addition, substantially all of the crude oil from our operations offshore Malaysia and China is produced into FPSOs and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated. Revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold, not when it is produced into the FPSO. As a result, the timing of liftings may impact period to period results. Revenues of $2.5 billion for 2011 were 31% higher than 2010. Approximately half of the increase in revenue for 2011 was due to higher average realized oil prices and half of the increase resulted from increased oil production. Revenues of $1.9 billion for 2010 were 41% higher than 2009. For 2010, approximately 60% of the revenue increase was due to higher average realized oil and gas prices, 25% related to increased oil production and the remainder resulted from increased natural gas production. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Production:(1)(2) Domestic: Natural gas (Bcf) 175.1 186.9 168.4 Oil, condensate and NGLs (MBbls) 12,943 10,016 8,045 Total (Bcfe) 252.7 247.0 216.7 International: Natural gas (Bcf) 0.1 Oil, condensate and NGLs (MBbls) 6,715 6,057 6,120 Total (Bcfe) 40.4 36.3 36.7 Total: Natural gas (Bcf) 175.2 186.9 168.4 Oil, condensate and NGLs (MBbls) 19,658 16,073 14,165 Total (Bcfe) 293.1 283.3 253.4 Average Realized Prices:(2)(3) Domestic: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 4.05 $ 4.09 $ 3.38 Oil, condensate and NGLs (per Bbl) 79.29 65.35 49.52 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 6.89 5.78 4.47 International: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 3.95 $ $ Oil, condensate and NGLs (per Bbl) 108.51 75.27 59.72 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 18.06 12.54 9.95 Total: Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 4.05 $ 4.09 $ 3.38 Oil, condensate and NGLs (per Bbl) 89.27 69.09 53.93 Natural gas equivalent (per Mcfe) 8.43 6.65 5.28 (1) Represents volumes lifted and sold regardless of when produced. Excludes natural gas produced and consumed in our operations of 6.8 Bcfe in 2011, 5.3 Bcfe in 2010 and 4.0 Bcfe in 2009. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (2) Historically, we reported natural gas liquids (NGLs) volumes in natural gas production volumes. Effective January 1, 2011, we began reporting our NGLs in barrels and included NGLs with total oil and condensate production. As such, all production volumes and average realized prices for periods prior to 2011 have been reclassified for comparability between periods. (3) Had we included the effects of hedging contracts not designated for hedge accounting, our average realized price for total natural gas would have been $5.43, $5.62 and $6.43 per Mcf for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $86.88, $77.86 and $78.19 per Bbl for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Domestic Production. Our 2011 domestic oil and gas production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased 2% over 2010 production primarily due to increased production of 8% in our Rocky Mountain and Mid Continent divisions as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts, partially offset by production decreases in our onshore Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico deepwater divisions due to natural field decline and weather and equipment related delays. Our 2010 domestic oil and gas production, stated on a natural gas equivalent basis, increased 14% over 2009 production primarily due to increased production of 18 Bcfe in our Mid Continent division as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts, combined with increased production of 13 Bcfe as a result of the further development of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater discoveries. International Production. Our 2011 international oil production increased over 2010 levels primarily due to an increase in production of 13% in Malaysia as a result of new field developments on PM 323 and PM 329 and the timing of liftings. Our 2010 international oil production decreased slightly from 2009 levels primarily due to the timing of liftings from our oil production in Malaysia. Operating Expenses. We believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production, or per Mcfe, basis. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two year period ended December 31, 2011. Unit of Production Total Amount Year EndedDecember 31, PercentageIncrease(Decrease) Year EndedDecember 31, PercentageIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 2011 2010 (Per Mcfe) (In millions) Domestic: Lease operating $ 1.42 $ 1.07 33 % $ 358 $ 264 35 % Production and other taxes 0.27 0.18 50 % 68 44 54 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.46 2.08 18 % 621 515 21 % General and administrative 0.71 0.61 16 % 180 150 20 % Ceiling test and other impairments 0.03 (100 )% 7 (100 )% Other 0.04 (100 )% 10 (100 )% Total operating expenses 4.85 4.01 21 % 1,227 990 24 % International: Lease operating $ 2.36 $ 1.72 37 % $ 95 $ 62 52 % Production and other taxes 6.49 2.25 188 % 262 82 220 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3.60 3.56 1 % 146 129 12 % General and administrative 0.13 0.17 (24 )% 5 6 (11 )% Total operating expenses 12.58 7.70 63 % 508 279 82 % Total: Lease operating $ 1.55 $ 1.15 35 % $ 453 $ 326 39 % Production and other taxes 1.13 0.44 157 % 330 126 162 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2.62 2.27 15 % 767 644 19 % General and administrative 0.63 0.55 15 % 185 156 19 % Ceiling test and other impairments 0.03 (100 )% 7 (100 )% Other 0.03 (100 )% 10 (100 )% Total operating expenses 5.92 4.47 32 % 1,735 1,269 37 % Domestic Operations. Our domestic operating expenses for 2011, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 21% over those for 2010. The components of the significant period to period change are as follows: Lease operating expense (LOE) includes normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our oil and gas wells, non recurring well workover and repair related expenses and the costs to transport our production to the applicable sales points. The increase in domestic LOE per Mcfe resulted from a 50% ($0.26 per Mcfe) increase in the normally recurring portion of our LOE. Recurring LOE in our Rocky Mountain division accounted for approximately 60% of the increase due to increased water handling and overall operating and service related costs in the basins in which we operate. In addition, LOE increased ($0.08 per Mcfe) due to increased transportation costs resulting from the commencement of firm transportation contracts in our Mid Continent division throughout 2010. Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased due to a 21% increase in realized oil prices during 2011, coupled with a 4% increase in oil and natural gas production subject to production taxes. Since late 2009, the shift of our capital investments toward the oil plays in our portfolio has resulted in an increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rate. The increase in total DD&A expense is related to the increase in the DD&A rate, coupled with the slight increase in our production volumes during 2011 compared to 2010. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements General and administrative (G&A) expense per Mcfe increased during 2011 due to employee related expenses associated with our growing domestic work force and approximately $7 million of legal expenses related to litigation in which we are the plaintiff. During 2011, we capitalized $83 million ($0.33 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $61 million ($0.25 per Mcfe) during 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of $7 million ($0.03 per Mcfe) for certain claims related to the bankruptcy proceedings associated with TXCO Resources Inc. Other expenses for 2010 included the early redemption premium of $12 million associated with the tender offer and repurchase of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011, partially offset by the $2 million cash received resulting from the termination of the associated interest rate swap. International Operations. Our international operating expenses for 2011, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 63% over 2010. The components of the significant period to period change are as follows: LOE per Mcfe increased due to non recurring pipeline and facilities repair in Malaysia, fixed production costs associated with certain of our production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Malaysia and increased overall operating service costs from the various PSCs during 2011 compared to 2010. Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased significantly due to an increase, per the terms of the PSCs, in the tax rate per barrel of oil lifted and sold as a result of the 44% increase in realized oil prices in 2011. Total DD&A expense increase was driven by the 11% increase in volumes during 2011 compared to 2010. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 The following table presents information about our operating expenses for the two year period ended December 31, 2010.

Our domestic operating expenses for 2010, stated on a Mcfe basis, decreased 60% as compared to 2009 primarily due to the full cost ceiling test writedown recorded at March 31, 2009. The components of the significant period to period change are as follows: LOE per Mcfe increased 14% primarily due to increased product transportation costs resulting from the commencement of firm transportation contracts during late 2009 and throughout 2010 in our Mid Continent division. Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased 20% primarily due to higher realized commodity prices during 2010. Total DD&A expense for 2010 increased 11% primarily as a result of the 14% increase in our production volumes during 2010 compared to 2009. Total G&A expense increased 8% primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with our growing domestic workforce. Employee related expenses include incentive compensation expense which is based on our company performance in comparison with peer companies in our industry as defined in the incentive compensation plan in effect during 2010. During 2010, we capitalized $61 million ($0.25 per Mcfe) of direct internal costs as compared to $58 million ($0.27 per Mcfe) in 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an impairment of $7 million ($0.03 per Mcfe) related to certain claims related to the bankruptcy proceedings associated with TXCO Resources Inc. In 2009, we recorded a ceiling test writedown of $1.3 billion ($6.20 per Mcfe) due to significantly lower natural gas prices at March 31, 2009. Other expenses for 2010 includes the early redemption premium of $12 million associated with the tender offer and repurchase of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011, partially offset by the $2 million cash received resulting from the termination of the associated interest rate swap. Other expenses for 2009 includes long term rig contract termination fees. International Operations. Our international operating expenses for 2010, stated on a Mcfe basis, increased 31% over the same period of 2009 primarily as a result of significantly higher production taxes during 2010 due to substantially higher realized oil prices. The components of the significant period to period change are as follows: LOE per Mcfe increased 12% primarily due to fixed production and operating costs associated with certain of our PSCs in Malaysia, a change in the mix of produced, lifted and sold production from various PSCs during 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 and increased workover activity. Production and other taxes per Mcfe increased significantly due to an increase, per the terms of the PSCs, in the tax rate per barrel of oil lifted and sold as a result of a 26% increase in realized oil prices during 2010. Interest Expense. The following table presents information about interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2011: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Gross interest expense: Credit arrangements $ 11 $ 3 $ 8 Senior notes 11 2 12 Senior subordinated notes 152 149 102 Other 1 2 4 Total gross interest expense 175 156 126 Capitalized interest (82 ) (58 ) (51 ) Net interest expense $ 93 $ 98 $ 75 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The increase in gross interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily resulted from increased borrowings under our credit arrangements and the September 2011 issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2022. The increase in gross interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily resulted from the January 2010 issuance of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, partially offset by the tender and repurchase of our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 during the first half of 2010 and lower outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements during 2010. See Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. Interest expense related to unproved properties is capitalized into oil and gas properties. Capitalized interest increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to an increase in the average balance of unproved properties primarily resulting from the acquisition of assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah. Capitalized interest increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the average balance of unproved properties primarily as a result of the Maverick Basin asset acquisition in February 2010. Commodity Derivative Income. The significant fluctuations in commodity derivative income from period to period are due to the significant volatility of oil and gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these periods. Taxes. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 36%, 37% and 39%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for all periods was different than the federal statutory tax rate due to deductions that do not generate tax benefits, state income taxes and the differences between international and U.S. federal statutory rates. Our effective tax rate generally approximates 37%. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by the release of the valuation allowance related to the Malaysia tax benefit recorded in 2008. Estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices, the timing, amount, and location of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and property acquisitions. These activities require substantial capital expenditures. Lower prices for oil and gas may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce, and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital, as further described below. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year. Our capital budgets (excluding acquisitions) are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash, primarily cash flows from operations. Approximately 80% of our expected 2012 domestic oil and gas production (excluding NGLs) supporting the current 2012 capital budget is hedged. Our 2012 capital budget, excluding capitalized interest and overhead of $210 million, is approximately $1.5 to $1.7 billion and focuses on projects with higher return on investment and which we believe generate and lay the foundation for oil production growth in 2012 and thereafter. Substantially all of the 2012 budget is allocated to oil or liquids rich projects. Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired. In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. We have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In May 2011, we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah for a total of approximately $303 million. The acquisitions were funded with borrowings under our credit facility. During 2011, we received proceeds from the sale of certain non strategic assets of approximately $406 million. We used the proceeds from these sales to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In September 2011, we sold $750 million of 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2022 and received proceeds of $742 million (net of discount and offering costs). These notes were issued at 99.956% of par to yield 5 3/4%. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit. We continue to hold auction rate securities with a fair value of $32 million. We attempt to sell these securities every 7 28 days until the auctions succeed, the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature. We currently do not believe that the decrease in the fair value of these investments is permanent or that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity given the amount of our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements. See Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding the auction rate securities. Credit Arrangements. In June 2011, we entered into a new revolving credit facility that matures in June 2016 and provides for loan commitments of $1.25 billion from a syndicate of 13 financial institutions, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent. As of December 31, 2011, the largest individual commitment by any lender was 13% of total commitments. In addition, subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility, we also have a total of $185 million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions, the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions. For a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements, please see Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. At February 21, 2012, we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, we had no outstanding borrowings under either our credit facility or our money market lines of credit. Our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately $1.4 billion as of February 21, 2012. Working Capital. Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments. Without the effects of commodity derivative instruments, we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital. Although we anticipate that our 2012 capital spending (excluding acquisitions) will correspond with our anticipated 2012 cash flows from operations and property sales proceeds, we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from operations do not necessarily match. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had negative working capital of $157 million and $197 million, respectively. The changes in our working capital are primarily a result of the timing of the collection of receivables, drilling activities, payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations. Cash Flows from Operations. Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our oil and gas production under floating price market sensitive contracts. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months. See Oil and Gas Hedging below. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within 45 60 days of production. As a result, cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate, but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by DD&A, ceiling test writedowns, other impairments or other non cash charges or credits. Our net cash flows from operations were approximately $1.6 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Our working capital requirements change each year as a result of the timing of drilling activities, receivable collections from purchasers and joint interest partners, payments made by us to vendors and other operators, the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations and the change in net cash receipts on derivative settlements. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for 2011 was $2.2 billion compared to $2.0 billion for 2010. During 2011, we: spent $2.6 billion primarily for additions to oil and gas properties (including $304 million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties); received proceeds of $406 million from sales of non strategic oil and gas assets; and redeemed investments of $2 million. During 2010, we: spent $2.0 billion primarily for additions to oil and gas properties (including $313 million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties); received proceeds of $12 million from sales of oil and gas assets; and redeemed investments of $8 million. Capital Expenditures. Our capital investments of $2.2 billion for 2011 increased 34% from our capital investments of $1.7 billion during 2010. These amounts exclude acquisitions of $321 million and $314 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and recorded asset retirement obligations of $33 million and $13 million in the respective years. Of the total $2.6 billion spent during 2011, we invested $1.5 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $237 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $433 million in acquisitions of proved and unproved property (leasehold) and domestic leasing activity and $333 million outside the United States. Our capital investments of $1.7 billion for 2010 increased 18% from our capital investments of $1.4 billion during 2009. These amounts exclude acquisitions of $314 million and $2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and recorded asset retirement obligations of $13 million and $19 million in the respective years. Of the total $2.0 billion spent during 2010, we invested $1.2 billion in domestic exploitation and development, $248 million in domestic exploration (exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity), $400 million in acquisitions of proved and unproved property (leasehold) and domestic leasing activity and $173 million outside the United States. We have budgeted $1.5 to $1.7 billion for capital spending in 2012. The planned budget excludes capitalized interest and overhead of $210 million and acquisitions. Substantially all of the 2012 budget is allocated to oil or liquids rich projects. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired. In addition, in the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In May 2011, we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the Uinta Basin of Utah for a total of approximately $303 million. The assets include approximately 65,000 net acres, which are largely undeveloped and located in the Central Basin, which is just north of our Greater Monument Butte field. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for 2011 were $684 million compared to $282 million for 2010. During 2011, we: borrowed and repaid approximately $4.0 billion under our credit arrangements; issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2022 at 99.956% of par and paid $8 million in associated debt issue costs; paid $8 million in debt issue costs associated with our new revolving credit facility; received proceeds of $13 million from issuances of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options; and repurchased $19 million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards. During 2010, we: borrowed $1.5 billion and repaid $1.7 billion under our credit arrangements; issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 at 99.109% of par and paid $8 million in associated debt issue costs; repaid our $175 million aggregate principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011; received proceeds of $34 million from issuances of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options; and repurchased $17 million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations by maturity as of December 31, 2011.

(2) Includes non cancellable agreements for office space and cancellable agreements for drilling rigs and other equipment, as well as certain service contracts. The majority of these obligations are related to contracts for hydraulic well fracturing services and drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value. Due to our various working interests where these service contracts will be utilized, it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation. Net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed. (3) As is common in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. We have work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, natural gas transportation and fulfilling other related commitments. At December 31, 2011, these work related commitments totaled $133 million, all of which were attributable to our international business. Actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted. We have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations. Given the size of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and production capacity in the respective divisions, we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these commitments. See Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties for a description of our production and proved reserves. As of December 31, 2011, our delivery commitments through 2020 were as follows: Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than5 Years Natural gas (MMMBtus) 39,626 39,626 Oil (MBbls) 56,071 915 23,025 15,901 16,230 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Credit Arrangements. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Arrangements above for a description of our revolving credit facility and money market lines of credit. Senior Notes In September 2011, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2022. We received net proceeds from the offering of $742 million. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things: incur debt secured by liens; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and enter into merger or consolidation transactions. The indenture also provides that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary. Senior Subordinated Notes In January 2010, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020. We received net proceeds from the offering of $686 million. Interest on our senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of our 6 5/8% notes due 2014 and our 6 5/8% notes due 2016 at any time, in each case, at a redemption price stated in the applicable indenture governing the notes. We may redeem some or all of our 7 1/8% notes due 2018 at any time on or after May 15, 2013 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes. Prior to May 15, 2013, we may redeem all, but not part, of our 7 1/8% notes at a make whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. We may redeem some or all of our 6 7/8% notes due 2020 at any time on or after February 1, 2015 at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes. Prior to February 1, 2015, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a make whole redemption price. In addition, before February 1, 2013, we may redeem up to 35% of our 6 7/8% notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at 106.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to, among other things: incur additional debt; make restricted payments; pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock; make certain investments; create liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Commitments under Joint Operating Agreements. Most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements. Typically, the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts, such as drilling contracts, for the benefit of all joint venture partners. Through the joint operating agreement, the non operators reimburse, and in some cases advance, the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator. These obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis. The joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations. Occasionally, the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses, frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses. Oil and Gas Hedging As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty, and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate hedging arrangements with that counterparty. At December 31, 2011, Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of Montreal, J Aron & Company and Societe Generale were the counterparties with respect to approximately 86% of our future hedged production, none of which were counterparty to more than 25% of our future hedged production. A significant number of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements are also lenders under our credit facility. Our credit facility, senior notes, senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. Historically, a majority of our hedged oil and gas production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges. The price that we receive for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically averages $0.25 $0.50 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index. Realized natural gas prices for our Mid Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 90 95% of the Henry Hub Index. In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 5 Bcf of our natural gas production from January 2012 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted average of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index. In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtus per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index. In the Mid Continent, we have hedged basis associated with approximately 17 Bcf of our anticipated natural gas production from the Stiles/Britt Ranch area for the period January 2012 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The price we receive for our Gulf Coast oil production, excluding NGLs, typically averages about 105 110% of the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price we receive for our oil production in the Rocky Mountains, excluding NGLs, is currently averaging about $15 $17 per barrel below the WTI price. Oil production from our Mid Continent properties, excluding NGLs, typically averages 90 95% of the WTI price. Crude oil from our operations in Malaysia typically sells at a slight discount to Tapis, or about 110 115% of WTI. Crude oil from our operations in China typically sells at $10 $15 per barrel greater than the WTI price. Accounting for Hedging Activities. We do not designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, we have in the past experienced, and are likely in the future to experience, significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2011, we had net derivative assets of $137 million, of which 52% was measured based upon our valuation model (i.e. Black Scholes), and, as such, are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. We value these contracts using a model that considers various inputs including (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments. We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties. Please see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Commodity Derivative Activities below and Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments as described above under Contractual Obligations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. We discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. See Results of Operations above and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make. For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into four categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category. We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method. This method of accounting requires the following significant estimates: 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves; costs withheld from amortization; and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties. Accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company. Accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions. Stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards, the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments. Oil and Gas Activities. Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, costs in effect at year end and a 10% discount rate. On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Final Rule). The Final Rule adopted revisions to the SECs oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and was effective for annual reports on Forms 10 K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009. On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010 03), which aligned the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932), with the requirements in the SECs Final Rule. We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010 03 effective December 31, 2009. The following critical accounting policies and estimates discussions reflect the new rules unless stated otherwise. See New Accounting Requirements below for a full discussion. Full Cost Method. We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country by country basis. Such amounts include the costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development costs, are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis. Our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Oil and Gas Reserves. Our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials and under period end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices, operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves. All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of DD&A expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward, earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown. To change our domestic DD&A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately 4%, or 145 Bcfe. To change our Malaysia DD&A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in Malaysia of approximately 3%, or 4 Bcfe. Since production from our China operations is immaterial, any change in the DD&A rate as a result of changes in our proved reserves in China would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If required, it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower DD&A expense in future periods. The ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. The ceiling value of oil and gas reserves is calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter. The full cost ceiling test impairment calculation also takes into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting, if any. At December 31, 2011, the ceiling value of our oil and gas reserves was calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas and $96.13 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. Using these prices, the ceiling exceeded the net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties by approximately $1.3 billion (net of tax) at December 31, 2011. Holding all other factors constant, if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months for both oil and gas were to decline approximately 10% from prices used at December 31, 2011, the excess of our domestic cost center ceiling over our capitalized costs would be reduced by approximately 65%. At December 31, 2011, the Malaysia and China cost center ceilings exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately $220 million and $390 million, respectively, net of tax. Holding all other factors constant, it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in Malaysia and China if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month oil price declined approximately 30% and 50%, respectively, from prices used at December 31, 2011. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements At March 31, 2009, prior to our adoption of the Final Rule and ASU 2010 03, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period end market prices of $3.63 per MMBtu for natural gas and $49.65 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials. Using these prices, the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties at March 31, 2009 exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately $1.3 billion ($854 million, after tax), resulting in a ceiling test writedown. Given the fluctuation of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term. If the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months decline, or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future. Costs Withheld From Amortization. Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data, wells currently being drilled and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. In addition, a portion of the incurred (if not previously included in the amortization base) and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization. To qualify, a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development (e.g., the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled). Incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work. Any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2011, we had a total of approximately $2.0 billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools. The application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2011 resulted in an excess of the cost center ceilings over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for each full cost pool. Holding all other factors constant, inclusion of approximately 75% of our domestic unevaluated property costs in the amortization base would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. Including all of our Malaysian unevaluated property costs in our Malaysia amortization base would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown. At December 31, 2011, there were no costs withheld from the amortization base in China. Future Development and Abandonment Costs. Future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms, gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location, type of production structure, water depth, reservoir depth and characteristics, market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. We review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Holding all other factors constant, if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward, earnings would decrease due to higher DD&A expense. Likewise, if these estimates are revised downward, earnings would increase due to lower DD&A expense. To change our domestic DD&A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately 10%, or $324 million. To change our Malaysia DD&A rate by $0.10 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in Malaysia of approximately 15%, or $16 million. Since production from our China operations is immaterial, any change in the DD&A rate as a result of changes in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in China would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations. Allocation of Purchase Price in Business Combinations. As part of our growth strategy, we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. As the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments, the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain. The value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under Full Cost Ceiling Limitation above. The accounting for business combinations changed effective January 1, 2009 and established how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition, measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction. The standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December 31, 2008. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2009. Since adoption of the standard, the assets we have acquired have not met the requirements to be accounted for as a business combination. Commodity Derivative Activities. We utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production. We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months. In the case of acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. Under accounting rules, we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production. Since late 2005, we have not designated future price risk management activities as accounting hedges. Because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis, we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty and subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. In determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts, we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative. Our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry standard models that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value, (c) volatility factors, (d) counterparty credit risk and (e) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements as well as other relevant economic measures. The calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model. The estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We periodically validate our valuations using independent third party quotations. The determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests). We utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties. Stock Based Compensation. We apply a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. For equity based compensation awards, compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period. We utilize the Black Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice based model for our performance and market based restricted stock. Additionally, in 2011, we granted cash settled restricted units that are accounted for under the liability method which require Newfield to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period. See Note 10, Stock Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a full discussion of our stock based compensation. New Accounting Requirements In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which made fair value measurements more consistent with fair value principles, enhanced consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures, and provided greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities. The additional guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions for the period ended March 31, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2009, the FASB established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. Although there is new terminology, the guidance was based on the same principles as those that previously existed. This guidance was effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. Our adoption of these provisions beginning with the period ended June 30, 2009 did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting (Final Rule). The Final Rule adopted revisions to the SECs oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and was effective for annual reports on Form 10 K for years ending on or after December 31, 2009. The revisions were intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies. The amendments were also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology. On January 6, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 03, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (ASU 2010 03), which aligned the FASBs oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SECs Final Rule. We adopted the Final Rule and ASU 2010 03 effective December 31, 2009 as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate. Such a change was accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance. Comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of ASU 2010 03 and the Final Rule were not required. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our adoption of ASU 2010 03 and the Final Rule on December 31, 2009 impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10 K for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, as follows: All oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with the prior period. This change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 using the updated reserves rules, which require use of the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months, adjusted for market differentials, and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates. Under the previous reserve estimation rules, which are no longer in effect, our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices. Our full cost ceiling test calculations at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves, which were calculated using the updated reserves rules. We historically have applied a policy of using our year end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate. As a result, the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 and subsequent quarters is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or the prior years. On April 20, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 14, Accounting for Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (ASU 2010 14), which aligned the oil and gas financial accounting and reporting requirements prescribed by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932) with the requirements in the SECs Final Rule. The adoption of ASU 2010 14 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued additional disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons for the transfers and disclosure of major purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. The guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. We adopted the provisions for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which we adopted for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. Adopting the disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2011, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The most significant change will require us, for Level 3 fair value measurements, to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. We do not expect adoption of the additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income. The guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity. The guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entitys equity. The guidance is retrospective and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. We elected early adoption of the provision for the year ended December 31, 2011. Adopting the reporting requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities. The guidance will require disclosure of gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We do not expect adoption of the additional disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Regulation Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations. An overview of these regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties Regulation. We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Please see the discussion under the caption We are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business, in Item 1A of this report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below. Oil and Gas Prices As part of our risk management program, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 24 months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. In the case of significant acquisitions, we may hedge acquired production for a longer period. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the NYMEX Henry Hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. While the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements. In addition, the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk. All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market. The use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the information under the caption Oil and Gas Hedging in Item 7 of this report and the discussion and tables in Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Rates At December 31, 2011, our debt was comprised of: FixedRate Debt VariableRate Debt (In millions) Revolving credit facility $ $ 86 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2022 750 6 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 325 6 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 550 7 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 600 6 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 695 Total debt $ 2,920 $ 86 We consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because approximately 97% of our obligations were at fixed rates. Our variable rate debt is currently at interest rates of 2% or less. For a further discussion of our debt instruments, see the discussion and tables in Note 8, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. To the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective countrys functional currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 2011. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
