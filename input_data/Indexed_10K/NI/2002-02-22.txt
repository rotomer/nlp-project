Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSources plans, proposed dispositions, objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may publish or otherwise make available forward looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent forward looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Realization of NiSources objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks and can be adversely affected by, among other things, increased competition in deregulated energy markets, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities, successful consummation of proposed acquisitions and dispositions, growth opportunities for NiSources regulated and nonregulated businesses, dealings with third parties over whom NiSource has no control, actual operating experience of acquired assets, NiSources ability to integrate acquired operations into its operations, the regulatory process, regulatory and legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and counter party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. CONSOLIDATED REVIEW The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $212.1 million, or $1.03 per share, compared to $141.1 million, or $1.05 per share, in 2000 and $153.9 million, or $1.24 per share in 1999. After adjusting for non recurring items as reflected on the table below, income from continuing operations was $249.6 million, or $1.22 per share in 2001, $251.5 million, or $1.87 per share in 2000 and $172.0 million or $1.38 per share in 1999. All per share amounts are based on basic common shares. 14 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Twelve months ended December 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2001 2000 1999 Income from Continuing Operations as Reported $ 212.1 $ 141.1 $ 153.9 Adjustments for non recurring items: Costs related to Columbia acquisition 4.1 67.4 8.1 Write down of assets 5.8 63.2 18.3 MHP (gain) and subsequent settlement 9.7 (23.8) Restructuring costs 17.9 3.6 Insurance settlement (8.3) Total Adjustments for Non recurring Items 37.5 110.4 18.1 Income from Continuing Operations after Adjustments $ 249.6 $ 251.5 $ 172.0 Earnings Per Basic Common Share $ 1.22 $ 1.87 $ 1.38 Taking into account income from continuing operations, results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting, NiSource reported 2001 net income of $216.2 million, or $1.05 per share, 2000 net income of $150.9 million, or $1.12 per share, and $160.4 million, or $1.29 per share for 1999. The results for 2001 and 2000 are not comparable due to the acquisition of Columbia that was completed on November 1, 2000. The current year includes a full twelve months of Columbia operations while 2000 included November and December only. In addition, earnings per share are not comparable because of the issuance of additional NiSource shares in connection with the Columbia acquisition. The positive impact of the addition of two million Columbia gas customers as well as the addition of new business segments (Gas Transmission and Storage and Exploration and Production) was reduced by record setting warm weather, a continuing economic downturn in the industrial and manufacturing sectors and a reduced level of trading opportunities for the merchant segment. The results for 2000 and 1999 are not directly comparable, due to the Columbia acquisition completed on November 1, 2000. The positive impact of Columbias net income for November and December of 2000 was increased by improved results from EnergyUSA, Inc., higher weather related natural gas deliveries and electric sales in December 2000 and summer 2000 and a $23.8 million after tax gain on the sale of NiSources interests in Market Hub Partners, L.P. (MHP) in September 2000. Results were negatively impacted by approximately $67.4 million of costs in 2000 and $8.1 million in 1999 related to the Columbia acquisition, and $63.2 million of expense in 2000 and $18.3 million for 1999 for the write down of certain assets. In 1999, a favorable adjustment of $8.3 million after tax was recorded for an insurance settlement associated with clean up activities for certain manufactured gas plant sites. Additional expense was also incurred in 2000 related to restructuring activities and the amortization of goodwill and higher interest and facility fees on borrowings. In November 2001, NiSource, IWCR and the city of Indianapolis (City) signed a definitive agreement for the City to buy the assets of IWC and other assets of IWCR and its subsidiaries for $515.0 million, which includes $132.4 million in IWCR debt and the redemption of $2.5 million of IWC preferred stock. NiSource will retain $80.0 million in IWC debt. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed in the second quarter of 2002. Consequently, these operations are reflected in discontinued operations. These discontinued operations resulted in after tax income of $0.1 million for 2001, $9.8 million for 2000 and $6.5 million in 1999. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, were $3,403.4 million, a $1,455.4 million increase over 2000. The increase, primarily attributable to twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000, was reduced by approximately $63.0 million by record setting warmer than normal weather. 15 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Net revenues for 2000 of $1,948 million, increased $555.3 million over 1999 due in part to $433.1 million from the inclusion of Columbias operations for the last two months of 2000 and an increase of $41.4 million for the full year effect of Bay State. Bay State was acquired in February 1999. Also contributing to the increase were improved margins on electric and wholesale natural gas sales, gas and power trading activities and increased sales to commercial and industrial customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,394.5 million in 2001, a $1,003.9 million increase over 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. In addition, the current year was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of $28.7 million, uncollectibles of $17.8 million related to the Enron bankruptcy, an increase in uncollectible customer accounts of $13.1 million and a one time charge of $15.5 million related to the settlement of the MHP litigation. Other transition and one time events increased operating expenses $21.7 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of $93.1 million for twelve months attributable to the Columbia acquisition compared to $15.0 million for two months in 2000. Operating expenses of $1,390.6 million for 2000 increased $435.8 million over 1999. Operation and maintenance expense was $245.9 million higher due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias results for November and December 2000 and the full year effect of Bay State. Higher expense in 2000 compared to 1999 was also attributable to costs related to restructuring activities that were implemented in 2000 to improve efficiencies, and higher employee related costs. In addition, $65.8 million of expense was recorded in 2000 to reflect losses on the sale of certain assets. In 1999, expense was reduced $13 million due to a favorable insurance adjustment related to manufactured gas plant site clean up costs. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expense increased $81.1 million reflecting Columbias operations for the last two months of 2000, the amortization of goodwill associated with the Columbia acquisition and the full year effect of Bay State as well as additional plant in service. Taxes other than income were $156.1 million higher also primarily due to the inclusion of Columbia for the last two months of 2000 and the full year effect of Bay State. Other Income (Deductions) Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Interest expense, net $(597.7) $(304.5) $(155.4) Minority interests (20.4) (20.4) (17.7) Preferred stock dividends (7.5) (7.8) (8.1) Other, net 12.0 42.3 (20.6) Total Other Income (Deductions) $(613.6) $(290.4) $(201.8) Other Income (Deductions) in 2001 reduced income $613.6 million compared to a reduction in 2000 of $290.4 million. Interest expense, net increased $293.2 million over 2000 primarily due to the full year effect of interest on Columbia outstanding debt and the debt incurred for the acquisition, offset by a decrease in interest rate on short term borrowings. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Dividends paid on Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities reflected in the table above as minority interests, were $20.4 million in 2001 and 2000. Preferred stock dividends paid were $7.5 million in 2001 and $7.8 million in 2000. Other, net increased 2001 income $12.0 million in 2001 and $42.3 million in 2000. The year 2000 included a $51.9 million gain on the sale of NiSources interest in MHP. Other Income (Deductions) in 2000 reduced income $290.4 million compared to a reduction in income of $201.8 million in 1999. Interest expense, net increased $149.1 million over 1999 due to additional borrowings incurred as a result of the acquisition of Columbia, the full year effect of interest on the $160 million in Puttable Reset Securities (PURS) issued in September 1999 and increased short term borrowings. Costs associated with facility fees and the ineffective component of interest rate hedges were charged to interest expense in 2000. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2000, dividends paid on Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities reflected in the table above as minority interests, were $20.4 million, an increase of $2.7 million from 1999, reflecting the full year effect of dividends on these securities, which were issued in February 1999. Other, net, increased $62.9 million primarily reflecting a $51.9 million gain on the sale of 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources interests in MHP in September 2000. In 1999, a $16.5 million non recurring charge was recorded associated with the carrying value of oil and gas properties and a loss that resulted from a decision to abandon certain businesses and facilities that were not consistent with NiSources strategic direction. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $57.3 million in 2001 over 2000 and increased $43.7 million in 2000 over 1999 primarily as a result of changes in pre tax income and timing differences for certain deferred tax issues. The effective income tax rate was 46.3%, 47.2% and 34.8% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected after tax gain of $0.1 million, or less than one cent per share, in 2001 compared to after tax income of $9.8 million, or $0.07 per share, in 2000 and $6.5 million, or $0.05 per share, in 1999. Income on discontinued operations reflects results for NiSources water operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet current operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas and electric distribution businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. In the summer months, cash receipts for electric sales normally exceed requirements. Also, during the summer months, cash on hand, together with external short term and long term financing, is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries; perform necessary maintenance of facilities; make capital improvements in plant; and expand service into new areas. Credit Facilities On November 1, 2000, NiSource completed the acquisition of Columbia for approximately $6 billion plus the assumption of approximately $2 billion of Columbia debt. The acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a new holding company. To complete the acquisition of Columbia, NiSource, through NiSource Finance, arranged a $6 billion 364 day acquisition facility with a syndicate of banks. On November 1, 2000, the closing date of the acquisition, the facility supported $4.1 billion of commercial paper issued to finance the Columbia acquisition. Subsequent to the November 1, 2000 Columbia acquisition, NiSource reduced its acquisition related commercial paper borrowings through the issuance of $2.5 billion of privately placed notes completed on November 10, 2000. This issuance included $750 million of three year notes paying a 7.5% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2003, $750 million of five year notes paying a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005 and $1 billion of ten year notes paying a 7.875% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2010. Subsequently, an additional $150 million of five year notes were issued, bearing a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005. On November 27, 2000, NiSource issued 11,500,000 new shares of NiSource common stock at an offering price of $25.25 per share. The $280.9 million of net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. During March 2001, NiSource arranged $2.5 billion in revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks to support its future working capital requirements, providing back stop support for NiSources commercial paper program. The new facility consolidated essentially all of NiSources existing short term credit facilities into one credit facility. The $2.5 billion credit facility consists of a $1.25 billion 364 day facility that terminates on March 22, 2002 and a $1.25 billion facility that terminates on March 23, 2004. On April 6, 2001, NiSource Finance issued $300.0 million of unsecured two year notes guaranteed by NiSource, paying a 5.75% coupon and maturing on April 15, 2003. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. As a means of further improving the balance sheet, NiSource intends to improve liquidity through proceeds obtained from the divestiture of the Indianapolis Water Company and SM&P, the issuance of additional notes and the sale of equity subsequent to the resolution of its pending rate investigation with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Additionally, NiSource is currently evaluating the appropriate dollar commitment level, if any, to be renewed under the 364 day facility on March 22, 2002. NiSource has begun preparation for the facility renewal and syndication process. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, $1,004.3 million and $2,078.8 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 was 3.14% and 7.44%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%, and credit facility advances (notes payable) of $417.9 million at December 31, 2000, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.78%. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, NiSource had $51.7 million and $128.5 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, $629.0 million of credit was available under the facility. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Credit Ratings On December 6, 2001 Fitch Ratings downgraded the long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc and its subsidiaries. Fitch cited weak consolidated credit coverage ratios and higher than projected debt levels at NiSource, resulting in a credit profile which was more consistent with a "BBB" rating category, rather than the previous "BBB+" rating. At the same time, Fitch also assigned a "Stable" ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries. On February 5, 2002, Fitch reaffirmed the credit ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries, but revised the Companys ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". In January 2002, Standard and Poors affirmed NiSources BBB credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On December 7, 2001, Moodys Investors Service put under review for possible downgrade the short term and long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries. Moodys stated rationale for their negative ratings watch action was NiSources higher than expected overall leverage level and concerns about the effect that the weakening local economy might have on the Companys operating results. Immediately following the Moodys ratings watch action, the Companys ability to rollover maturities within the A2/P2 commercial paper market was significantly constrained. As a result, the Company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund a number of commercial paper maturities occurring subsequent to the Moodys ratings watch action. At December 31, 2001, $850.0 million of commercial paper maturities had been refinanced through NiSources revolving credit facility. On February 1, 2001, Moodys downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to the parents ratings going forward. As a split rated A2/P3 commercial paper issuer, the Company expects that its access to the commercial paper market will be significantly constrained and will meet its liquidity needs going forward by using its revolving credit facility and also terming out a portion of its short term borrowing requirements in the fixed income capital markets. Moodys also revised the Companys Outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". NiSource has entered into gas and electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $110.0 million to $115.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade below Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17 million to $35 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, has asked that NiSource post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million declining over time to support the bonds. NiSource will comply with this request. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2002. These commitments include long term debt; lease obligations, primarily operating leases related to the Companys Primary Energy subsidiaries; and unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through the Companys Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual cash obligations in existence at December 31, 2001 due pursuant to contractual commitments are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Long term debt $ 398.0 $1,199.0 $ 115.4 $1,013.7 $ 440.0 $3,152.1 Capital leases 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 1.0 Operating leases 149.8 168.1 110.5 109.3 157.9 643.2 Unconditional purchase obligations 136.2 92.8 80.8 64.8 53.2 237.5 Total contractual obligations $ 684.2 $1,460.1 $ 307.0 $1,188.1 $ 651.5 $4,033.8 NiSource also has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2002. These commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and financing guarantees. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they expire are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Lines of credit $1,004.3 $ $ 850.0 $ $ $ Letters of credit 7.2 40.2 2.8 0.6 1.0 Guarantees 722.8 17.0 116.8 1,095.0 1,090.3 Total commercial commitments $1,734.3 $ 57.2 $ 852.8 $ 117.4 $1,095.0 $1,091.3 Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2001 and 2000 and an estimate for year 2002: (in millions) 2002E 2001 2000 Gas Distribution $190.7 $211.3 $138.3 Transmission & Storage 132.3 137.4 50.3 Electric 205.1 134.7 132.2 Exploration & Production 91.0 118.8 22.7 Merchant 6.1 0.8 1.2 Other 25.6 76.2 21.1 Total $650.8 $679.2 $365.8 For 2001, capital expenditures were $679.2 million, an increase of $313.4 million over 2000. These figures are not directly comparable due to the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Columbias capital expenditures for the last two months are included in the 2000 financial statements. The gas distribution segments capital program in 2001 included investments to extend service to new areas and develop future markets, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers. The transmission and storage segment spent $85.7 million in 2001 to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipelines. The remaining $51.7 million was used for market development activities and new business initiatives. The electric program expenditures mainly related to adding new customers and maintaining equipment. The exploration and production segments 2001 program primarily included the drilling of 230 new wells in the Appalachian Basin and Canada. Other products and services comprised of $28.7 million for the completion of Transcoms fiber optics network, $13.0 million for investments in fuel cell technologies and the remainder for information technology improvements and infrastructure maintenance. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. For 2002, the projected capital program is expected to be $650.8 million, which is $28.4 million lower than the 2001 level. This reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of NiSource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments. The program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions. All estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility and economic trends. Enron Bankruptcy Filing On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. NiSource has certain exposure to Enron, as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to Enron at NiSources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries. Prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing, NiSource had basis and commodity swaps, pipeline transportation and storage agreements, physical commodity contracts for natural gas, electricity and coal, and SO2 trading agreements in place with Enron as the counterparty. All contracts, with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the Columbia of Ohio gas distribution subsidiary, were terminated by NiSource at the end of November 2001. NiSource recorded a pre tax charge of $17.8 million in 2001 related to the Enron bankruptcy filing. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. NiSource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes, which are ultimately dependent upon the customers supply requirements. NiSource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

The results for 2001 and 2000 are not comparable due to the acquisition of Columbia that was completed on November 1, 2000. The current year includes a full twelve months of Columbia operations while 2000 included November and December only. In addition, earnings per share are not comparable because of the issuance of additional NiSource shares in connection with the Columbia acquisition. The positive impact of the addition of two million Columbia gas customers as well as the addition of new business segments (Gas Transmission and Storage and Exploration and Production) was reduced by record setting warm weather, a continuing economic downturn in the industrial and manufacturing sectors and a reduced level of trading opportunities for the merchant segment. The results for 2000 and 1999 are not directly comparable, due to the Columbia acquisition completed on November 1, 2000. The positive impact of Columbias net income for November and December of 2000 was increased by improved results from EnergyUSA, Inc., higher weather related natural gas deliveries and electric sales in December 2000 and summer 2000 and a $23.8 million after tax gain on the sale of NiSources interests in Market Hub Partners, L.P. (MHP) in September 2000. Results were negatively impacted by approximately $67.4 million of costs in 2000 and $8.1 million in 1999 related to the Columbia acquisition, and $63.2 million of expense in 2000 and $18.3 million for 1999 for the write down of certain assets. In 1999, a favorable adjustment of $8.3 million after tax was recorded for an insurance settlement associated with clean up activities for certain manufactured gas plant sites. Additional expense was also incurred in 2000 related to restructuring activities and the amortization of goodwill and higher interest and facility fees on borrowings. In November 2001, NiSource, IWCR and the city of Indianapolis (City) signed a definitive agreement for the City to buy the assets of IWC and other assets of IWCR and its subsidiaries for $515.0 million, which includes $132.4 million in IWCR debt and the redemption of $2.5 million of IWC preferred stock. NiSource will retain $80.0 million in IWC debt. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed in the second quarter of 2002. Consequently, these operations are reflected in discontinued operations. These discontinued operations resulted in after tax income of $0.1 million for 2001, $9.8 million for 2000 and $6.5 million in 1999. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, were $3,403.4 million, a $1,455.4 million increase over 2000. The increase, primarily attributable to twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000, was reduced by approximately $63.0 million by record setting warmer than normal weather. 15 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Net revenues for 2000 of $1,948 million, increased $555.3 million over 1999 due in part to $433.1 million from the inclusion of Columbias operations for the last two months of 2000 and an increase of $41.4 million for the full year effect of Bay State. Bay State was acquired in February 1999. Also contributing to the increase were improved margins on electric and wholesale natural gas sales, gas and power trading activities and increased sales to commercial and industrial customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,394.5 million in 2001, a $1,003.9 million increase over 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. In addition, the current year was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of $28.7 million, uncollectibles of $17.8 million related to the Enron bankruptcy, an increase in uncollectible customer accounts of $13.1 million and a one time charge of $15.5 million related to the settlement of the MHP litigation. Other transition and one time events increased operating expenses $21.7 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of $93.1 million for twelve months attributable to the Columbia acquisition compared to $15.0 million for two months in 2000. Operating expenses of $1,390.6 million for 2000 increased $435.8 million over 1999. Operation and maintenance expense was $245.9 million higher due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias results for November and December 2000 and the full year effect of Bay State. Higher expense in 2000 compared to 1999 was also attributable to costs related to restructuring activities that were implemented in 2000 to improve efficiencies, and higher employee related costs. In addition, $65.8 million of expense was recorded in 2000 to reflect losses on the sale of certain assets. In 1999, expense was reduced $13 million due to a favorable insurance adjustment related to manufactured gas plant site clean up costs. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expense increased $81.1 million reflecting Columbias operations for the last two months of 2000, the amortization of goodwill associated with the Columbia acquisition and the full year effect of Bay State as well as additional plant in service. Taxes other than income were $156.1 million higher also primarily due to the inclusion of Columbia for the last two months of 2000 and the full year effect of Bay State.

Other Income (Deductions) in 2000 reduced income $290.4 million compared to a reduction in income of $201.8 million in 1999. Interest expense, net increased $149.1 million over 1999 due to additional borrowings incurred as a result of the acquisition of Columbia, the full year effect of interest on the $160 million in Puttable Reset Securities (PURS) issued in September 1999 and increased short term borrowings. Costs associated with facility fees and the ineffective component of interest rate hedges were charged to interest expense in 2000. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2000, dividends paid on Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities reflected in the table above as minority interests, were $20.4 million, an increase of $2.7 million from 1999, reflecting the full year effect of dividends on these securities, which were issued in February 1999.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources interests in MHP in September 2000. In 1999, a $16.5 million non recurring charge was recorded associated with the carrying value of oil and gas properties and a loss that resulted from a decision to abandon certain businesses and facilities that were not consistent with NiSources strategic direction. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $57.3 million in 2001 over 2000 and increased $43.7 million in 2000 over 1999 primarily as a result of changes in pre tax income and timing differences for certain deferred tax issues. The effective income tax rate was 46.3%, 47.2% and 34.8% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected after tax gain of $0.1 million, or less than one cent per share, in 2001 compared to after tax income of $9.8 million, or $0.07 per share, in 2000 and $6.5 million, or $0.05 per share, in 1999. Income on discontinued operations reflects results for NiSources water operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet current operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas and electric distribution businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. In the summer months, cash receipts for electric sales normally exceed requirements. Also, during the summer months, cash on hand, together with external short term and long term financing, is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries; perform necessary maintenance of facilities; make capital improvements in plant; and expand service into new areas. Credit Facilities On November 1, 2000, NiSource completed the acquisition of Columbia for approximately $6 billion plus the assumption of approximately $2 billion of Columbia debt. The acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a new holding company. To complete the acquisition of Columbia, NiSource, through NiSource Finance, arranged a $6 billion 364 day acquisition facility with a syndicate of banks. On November 1, 2000, the closing date of the acquisition, the facility supported $4.1 billion of commercial paper issued to finance the Columbia acquisition. Subsequent to the November 1, 2000 Columbia acquisition, NiSource reduced its acquisition related commercial paper borrowings through the issuance of $2.5 billion of privately placed notes completed on November 10, 2000. This issuance included $750 million of three year notes paying a 7.5% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2003, $750 million of five year notes paying a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005 and $1 billion of ten year notes paying a 7.875% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2010. Subsequently, an additional $150 million of five year notes were issued, bearing a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005. On November 27, 2000, NiSource issued 11,500,000 new shares of NiSource common stock at an offering price of $25.25 per share. The $280.9 million of net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. During March 2001, NiSource arranged $2.5 billion in revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks to support its future working capital requirements, providing back stop support for NiSources commercial paper program. The new facility consolidated essentially all of NiSources existing short term credit facilities into one credit facility. The $2.5 billion credit facility consists of a $1.25 billion 364 day facility that terminates on March 22, 2002 and a $1.25 billion facility that terminates on March 23, 2004. On April 6, 2001, NiSource Finance issued $300.0 million of unsecured two year notes guaranteed by NiSource, paying a 5.75% coupon and maturing on April 15, 2003. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. As a means of further improving the balance sheet, NiSource intends to improve liquidity through proceeds obtained from the divestiture of the Indianapolis Water Company and SM&P, the issuance of additional notes and the sale of equity subsequent to the resolution of its pending rate investigation with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Additionally, NiSource is currently evaluating the appropriate dollar commitment level, if any, to be renewed under the 364 day facility on March 22, 2002. NiSource has begun preparation for the facility renewal and syndication process. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, $1,004.3 million and $2,078.8 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 was 3.14% and 7.44%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%, and credit facility advances (notes payable) of $417.9 million at December 31, 2000, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.78%. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, NiSource had $51.7 million and $128.5 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, $629.0 million of credit was available under the facility. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Credit Ratings On December 6, 2001 Fitch Ratings downgraded the long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc and its subsidiaries. Fitch cited weak consolidated credit coverage ratios and higher than projected debt levels at NiSource, resulting in a credit profile which was more consistent with a "BBB" rating category, rather than the previous "BBB+" rating. At the same time, Fitch also assigned a "Stable" ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries. On February 5, 2002, Fitch reaffirmed the credit ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries, but revised the Companys ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". In January 2002, Standard and Poors affirmed NiSources BBB credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On December 7, 2001, Moodys Investors Service put under review for possible downgrade the short term and long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries. Moodys stated rationale for their negative ratings watch action was NiSources higher than expected overall leverage level and concerns about the effect that the weakening local economy might have on the Companys operating results. Immediately following the Moodys ratings watch action, the Companys ability to rollover maturities within the A2/P2 commercial paper market was significantly constrained. As a result, the Company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund a number of commercial paper maturities occurring subsequent to the Moodys ratings watch action. At December 31, 2001, $850.0 million of commercial paper maturities had been refinanced through NiSources revolving credit facility. On February 1, 2001, Moodys downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to the parents ratings going forward. As a split rated A2/P3 commercial paper issuer, the Company expects that its access to the commercial paper market will be significantly constrained and will meet its liquidity needs going forward by using its revolving credit facility and also terming out a portion of its short term borrowing requirements in the fixed income capital markets. Moodys also revised the Companys Outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". NiSource has entered into gas and electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $110.0 million to $115.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade below Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17 million to $35 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, has asked that NiSource post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million declining over time to support the bonds. NiSource will comply with this request. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2002. These commitments include long term debt; lease obligations, primarily operating leases related to the Companys Primary Energy subsidiaries; and unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through the Companys Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual cash obligations in existence at December 31, 2001 due pursuant to contractual commitments are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Long term debt $ 398.0 $1,199.0 $ 115.4 $1,013.7 $ 440.0 $3,152.1 Capital leases 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 1.0 Operating leases 149.8 168.1 110.5 109.3 157.9 643.2 Unconditional purchase obligations 136.2 92.8 80.8 64.8 53.2 237.5 Total contractual obligations $ 684.2 $1,460.1 $ 307.0 $1,188.1 $ 651.5 $4,033.8 NiSource also has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2002. These commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and financing guarantees. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they expire are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Lines of credit $1,004.3 $ $ 850.0 $ $ $ Letters of credit 7.2 40.2 2.8 0.6 1.0 Guarantees 722.8 17.0 116.8 1,095.0 1,090.3 Total commercial commitments $1,734.3 $ 57.2 $ 852.8 $ 117.4 $1,095.0 $1,091.3 Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2001 and 2000 and an estimate for year 2002: (in millions) 2002E 2001 2000 Gas Distribution $190.7 $211.3 $138.3 Transmission & Storage 132.3 137.4 50.3 Electric 205.1 134.7 132.2 Exploration & Production 91.0 118.8 22.7 Merchant 6.1 0.8 1.2 Other 25.6 76.2 21.1 Total $650.8 $679.2 $365.8 For 2001, capital expenditures were $679.2 million, an increase of $313.4 million over 2000. These figures are not directly comparable due to the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Columbias capital expenditures for the last two months are included in the 2000 financial statements. The gas distribution segments capital program in 2001 included investments to extend service to new areas and develop future markets, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers. The transmission and storage segment spent $85.7 million in 2001 to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipelines. The remaining $51.7 million was used for market development activities and new business initiatives. The electric program expenditures mainly related to adding new customers and maintaining equipment. The exploration and production segments 2001 program primarily included the drilling of 230 new wells in the Appalachian Basin and Canada. Other products and services comprised of $28.7 million for the completion of Transcoms fiber optics network, $13.0 million for investments in fuel cell technologies and the remainder for information technology improvements and infrastructure maintenance. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. For 2002, the projected capital program is expected to be $650.8 million, which is $28.4 million lower than the 2001 level. This reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of NiSource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments. The program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions. All estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility and economic trends. Enron Bankruptcy Filing On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. NiSource has certain exposure to Enron, as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to Enron at NiSources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries. Prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing, NiSource had basis and commodity swaps, pipeline transportation and storage agreements, physical commodity contracts for natural gas, electricity and coal, and SO2 trading agreements in place with Enron as the counterparty. All contracts, with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the Columbia of Ohio gas distribution subsidiary, were terminated by NiSource at the end of November 2001. NiSource recorded a pre tax charge of $17.8 million in 2001 related to the Enron bankruptcy filing. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. NiSource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes, which are ultimately dependent upon the customers supply requirements. NiSource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Net revenues for 2000 of $1,948 million, increased $555.3 million over 1999 due in part to $433.1 million from the inclusion of Columbias operations for the last two months of 2000 and an increase of $41.4 million for the full year effect of Bay State. Bay State was acquired in February 1999. Also contributing to the increase were improved margins on electric and wholesale natural gas sales, gas and power trading activities and increased sales to commercial and industrial customers. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,394.5 million in 2001, a $1,003.9 million increase over 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. In addition, the current year was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of $28.7 million, uncollectibles of $17.8 million related to the Enron bankruptcy, an increase in uncollectible customer accounts of $13.1 million and a one time charge of $15.5 million related to the settlement of the MHP litigation. Other transition and one time events increased operating expenses $21.7 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of $93.1 million for twelve months attributable to the Columbia acquisition compared to $15.0 million for two months in 2000. Operating expenses of $1,390.6 million for 2000 increased $435.8 million over 1999. Operation and maintenance expense was $245.9 million higher due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias results for November and December 2000 and the full year effect of Bay State. Higher expense in 2000 compared to 1999 was also attributable to costs related to restructuring activities that were implemented in 2000 to improve efficiencies, and higher employee related costs. In addition, $65.8 million of expense was recorded in 2000 to reflect losses on the sale of certain assets. In 1999, expense was reduced $13 million due to a favorable insurance adjustment related to manufactured gas plant site clean up costs. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expense increased $81.1 million reflecting Columbias operations for the last two months of 2000, the amortization of goodwill associated with the Columbia acquisition and the full year effect of Bay State as well as additional plant in service. Taxes other than income were $156.1 million higher also primarily due to the inclusion of Columbia for the last two months of 2000 and the full year effect of Bay State. Other Income (Deductions) Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Interest expense, net $(597.7) $(304.5) $(155.4) Minority interests (20.4) (20.4) (17.7) Preferred stock dividends (7.5) (7.8) (8.1) Other, net 12.0 42.3 (20.6) Total Other Income (Deductions) $(613.6) $(290.4) $(201.8) Other Income (Deductions) in 2001 reduced income $613.6 million compared to a reduction in 2000 of $290.4 million. Interest expense, net increased $293.2 million over 2000 primarily due to the full year effect of interest on Columbia outstanding debt and the debt incurred for the acquisition, offset by a decrease in interest rate on short term borrowings. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Dividends paid on Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities reflected in the table above as minority interests, were $20.4 million in 2001 and 2000. Preferred stock dividends paid were $7.5 million in 2001 and $7.8 million in 2000. Other, net increased 2001 income $12.0 million in 2001 and $42.3 million in 2000. The year 2000 included a $51.9 million gain on the sale of NiSources interest in MHP. Other Income (Deductions) in 2000 reduced income $290.4 million compared to a reduction in income of $201.8 million in 1999. Interest expense, net increased $149.1 million over 1999 due to additional borrowings incurred as a result of the acquisition of Columbia, the full year effect of interest on the $160 million in Puttable Reset Securities (PURS) issued in September 1999 and increased short term borrowings. Costs associated with facility fees and the ineffective component of interest rate hedges were charged to interest expense in 2000. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2000, dividends paid on Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities reflected in the table above as minority interests, were $20.4 million, an increase of $2.7 million from 1999, reflecting the full year effect of dividends on these securities, which were issued in February 1999. Other, net, increased $62.9 million primarily reflecting a $51.9 million gain on the sale of 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources interests in MHP in September 2000. In 1999, a $16.5 million non recurring charge was recorded associated with the carrying value of oil and gas properties and a loss that resulted from a decision to abandon certain businesses and facilities that were not consistent with NiSources strategic direction. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $57.3 million in 2001 over 2000 and increased $43.7 million in 2000 over 1999 primarily as a result of changes in pre tax income and timing differences for certain deferred tax issues. The effective income tax rate was 46.3%, 47.2% and 34.8% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected after tax gain of $0.1 million, or less than one cent per share, in 2001 compared to after tax income of $9.8 million, or $0.07 per share, in 2000 and $6.5 million, or $0.05 per share, in 1999. Income on discontinued operations reflects results for NiSources water operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet current operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas and electric distribution businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. In the summer months, cash receipts for electric sales normally exceed requirements. Also, during the summer months, cash on hand, together with external short term and long term financing, is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries; perform necessary maintenance of facilities; make capital improvements in plant; and expand service into new areas. Credit Facilities On November 1, 2000, NiSource completed the acquisition of Columbia for approximately $6 billion plus the assumption of approximately $2 billion of Columbia debt. The acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a new holding company. To complete the acquisition of Columbia, NiSource, through NiSource Finance, arranged a $6 billion 364 day acquisition facility with a syndicate of banks. On November 1, 2000, the closing date of the acquisition, the facility supported $4.1 billion of commercial paper issued to finance the Columbia acquisition. Subsequent to the November 1, 2000 Columbia acquisition, NiSource reduced its acquisition related commercial paper borrowings through the issuance of $2.5 billion of privately placed notes completed on November 10, 2000. This issuance included $750 million of three year notes paying a 7.5% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2003, $750 million of five year notes paying a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005 and $1 billion of ten year notes paying a 7.875% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2010. Subsequently, an additional $150 million of five year notes were issued, bearing a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005. On November 27, 2000, NiSource issued 11,500,000 new shares of NiSource common stock at an offering price of $25.25 per share. The $280.9 million of net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. During March 2001, NiSource arranged $2.5 billion in revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks to support its future working capital requirements, providing back stop support for NiSources commercial paper program. The new facility consolidated essentially all of NiSources existing short term credit facilities into one credit facility. The $2.5 billion credit facility consists of a $1.25 billion 364 day facility that terminates on March 22, 2002 and a $1.25 billion facility that terminates on March 23, 2004. On April 6, 2001, NiSource Finance issued $300.0 million of unsecured two year notes guaranteed by NiSource, paying a 5.75% coupon and maturing on April 15, 2003. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. As a means of further improving the balance sheet, NiSource intends to improve liquidity through proceeds obtained from the divestiture of the Indianapolis Water Company and SM&P, the issuance of additional notes and the sale of equity subsequent to the resolution of its pending rate investigation with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Additionally, NiSource is currently evaluating the appropriate dollar commitment level, if any, to be renewed under the 364 day facility on March 22, 2002. NiSource has begun preparation for the facility renewal and syndication process. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, $1,004.3 million and $2,078.8 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 was 3.14% and 7.44%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%, and credit facility advances (notes payable) of $417.9 million at December 31, 2000, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.78%. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, NiSource had $51.7 million and $128.5 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, $629.0 million of credit was available under the facility. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Credit Ratings On December 6, 2001 Fitch Ratings downgraded the long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc and its subsidiaries. Fitch cited weak consolidated credit coverage ratios and higher than projected debt levels at NiSource, resulting in a credit profile which was more consistent with a "BBB" rating category, rather than the previous "BBB+" rating. At the same time, Fitch also assigned a "Stable" ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries. On February 5, 2002, Fitch reaffirmed the credit ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries, but revised the Companys ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". In January 2002, Standard and Poors affirmed NiSources BBB credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On December 7, 2001, Moodys Investors Service put under review for possible downgrade the short term and long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries. Moodys stated rationale for their negative ratings watch action was NiSources higher than expected overall leverage level and concerns about the effect that the weakening local economy might have on the Companys operating results. Immediately following the Moodys ratings watch action, the Companys ability to rollover maturities within the A2/P2 commercial paper market was significantly constrained. As a result, the Company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund a number of commercial paper maturities occurring subsequent to the Moodys ratings watch action. At December 31, 2001, $850.0 million of commercial paper maturities had been refinanced through NiSources revolving credit facility. On February 1, 2001, Moodys downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to the parents ratings going forward. As a split rated A2/P3 commercial paper issuer, the Company expects that its access to the commercial paper market will be significantly constrained and will meet its liquidity needs going forward by using its revolving credit facility and also terming out a portion of its short term borrowing requirements in the fixed income capital markets. Moodys also revised the Companys Outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". NiSource has entered into gas and electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $110.0 million to $115.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade below Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17 million to $35 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, has asked that NiSource post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million declining over time to support the bonds. NiSource will comply with this request. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2002. These commitments include long term debt; lease obligations, primarily operating leases related to the Companys Primary Energy subsidiaries; and unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through the Companys Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual cash obligations in existence at December 31, 2001 due pursuant to contractual commitments are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Long term debt $ 398.0 $1,199.0 $ 115.4 $1,013.7 $ 440.0 $3,152.1 Capital leases 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 1.0 Operating leases 149.8 168.1 110.5 109.3 157.9 643.2 Unconditional purchase obligations 136.2 92.8 80.8 64.8 53.2 237.5 Total contractual obligations $ 684.2 $1,460.1 $ 307.0 $1,188.1 $ 651.5 $4,033.8 NiSource also has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2002. These commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and financing guarantees. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they expire are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Lines of credit $1,004.3 $ $ 850.0 $ $ $ Letters of credit 7.2 40.2 2.8 0.6 1.0 Guarantees 722.8 17.0 116.8 1,095.0 1,090.3 Total commercial commitments $1,734.3 $ 57.2 $ 852.8 $ 117.4 $1,095.0 $1,091.3 Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2001 and 2000 and an estimate for year 2002: (in millions) 2002E 2001 2000 Gas Distribution $190.7 $211.3 $138.3 Transmission & Storage 132.3 137.4 50.3 Electric 205.1 134.7 132.2 Exploration & Production 91.0 118.8 22.7 Merchant 6.1 0.8 1.2 Other 25.6 76.2 21.1 Total $650.8 $679.2 $365.8 For 2001, capital expenditures were $679.2 million, an increase of $313.4 million over 2000. These figures are not directly comparable due to the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Columbias capital expenditures for the last two months are included in the 2000 financial statements. The gas distribution segments capital program in 2001 included investments to extend service to new areas and develop future markets, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers. The transmission and storage segment spent $85.7 million in 2001 to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipelines. The remaining $51.7 million was used for market development activities and new business initiatives. The electric program expenditures mainly related to adding new customers and maintaining equipment. The exploration and production segments 2001 program primarily included the drilling of 230 new wells in the Appalachian Basin and Canada. Other products and services comprised of $28.7 million for the completion of Transcoms fiber optics network, $13.0 million for investments in fuel cell technologies and the remainder for information technology improvements and infrastructure maintenance. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. For 2002, the projected capital program is expected to be $650.8 million, which is $28.4 million lower than the 2001 level. This reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of NiSource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments. The program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions. All estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility and economic trends. Enron Bankruptcy Filing On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. NiSource has certain exposure to Enron, as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to Enron at NiSources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries. Prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing, NiSource had basis and commodity swaps, pipeline transportation and storage agreements, physical commodity contracts for natural gas, electricity and coal, and SO2 trading agreements in place with Enron as the counterparty. All contracts, with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the Columbia of Ohio gas distribution subsidiary, were terminated by NiSource at the end of November 2001. NiSource recorded a pre tax charge of $17.8 million in 2001 related to the Enron bankruptcy filing. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. NiSource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes, which are ultimately dependent upon the customers supply requirements. NiSource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources interests in MHP in September 2000. In 1999, a $16.5 million non recurring charge was recorded associated with the carrying value of oil and gas properties and a loss that resulted from a decision to abandon certain businesses and facilities that were not consistent with NiSources strategic direction. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $57.3 million in 2001 over 2000 and increased $43.7 million in 2000 over 1999 primarily as a result of changes in pre tax income and timing differences for certain deferred tax issues. The effective income tax rate was 46.3%, 47.2% and 34.8% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected after tax gain of $0.1 million, or less than one cent per share, in 2001 compared to after tax income of $9.8 million, or $0.07 per share, in 2000 and $6.5 million, or $0.05 per share, in 1999. Income on discontinued operations reflects results for NiSources water operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet current operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas and electric distribution businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. In the summer months, cash receipts for electric sales normally exceed requirements. Also, during the summer months, cash on hand, together with external short term and long term financing, is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries; perform necessary maintenance of facilities; make capital improvements in plant; and expand service into new areas. Credit Facilities On November 1, 2000, NiSource completed the acquisition of Columbia for approximately $6 billion plus the assumption of approximately $2 billion of Columbia debt. The acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a new holding company. To complete the acquisition of Columbia, NiSource, through NiSource Finance, arranged a $6 billion 364 day acquisition facility with a syndicate of banks. On November 1, 2000, the closing date of the acquisition, the facility supported $4.1 billion of commercial paper issued to finance the Columbia acquisition. Subsequent to the November 1, 2000 Columbia acquisition, NiSource reduced its acquisition related commercial paper borrowings through the issuance of $2.5 billion of privately placed notes completed on November 10, 2000. This issuance included $750 million of three year notes paying a 7.5% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2003, $750 million of five year notes paying a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005 and $1 billion of ten year notes paying a 7.875% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2010. Subsequently, an additional $150 million of five year notes were issued, bearing a 7.625% coupon and maturing on November 15, 2005. On November 27, 2000, NiSource issued 11,500,000 new shares of NiSource common stock at an offering price of $25.25 per share. The $280.9 million of net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. During March 2001, NiSource arranged $2.5 billion in revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks to support its future working capital requirements, providing back stop support for NiSources commercial paper program. The new facility consolidated essentially all of NiSources existing short term credit facilities into one credit facility. The $2.5 billion credit facility consists of a $1.25 billion 364 day facility that terminates on March 22, 2002 and a $1.25 billion facility that terminates on March 23, 2004. On April 6, 2001, NiSource Finance issued $300.0 million of unsecured two year notes guaranteed by NiSource, paying a 5.75% coupon and maturing on April 15, 2003. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. As a means of further improving the balance sheet, NiSource intends to improve liquidity through proceeds obtained from the divestiture of the Indianapolis Water Company and SM&P, the issuance of additional notes and the sale of equity subsequent to the resolution of its pending rate investigation with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Additionally, NiSource is currently evaluating the appropriate dollar commitment level, if any, to be renewed under the 364 day facility on March 22, 2002. NiSource has begun preparation for the facility renewal and syndication process. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, $1,004.3 million and $2,078.8 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 was 3.14% and 7.44%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%, and credit facility advances (notes payable) of $417.9 million at December 31, 2000, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.78%. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, NiSource had $51.7 million and $128.5 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, $629.0 million of credit was available under the facility. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Credit Ratings On December 6, 2001 Fitch Ratings downgraded the long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc and its subsidiaries. Fitch cited weak consolidated credit coverage ratios and higher than projected debt levels at NiSource, resulting in a credit profile which was more consistent with a "BBB" rating category, rather than the previous "BBB+" rating. At the same time, Fitch also assigned a "Stable" ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries. On February 5, 2002, Fitch reaffirmed the credit ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries, but revised the Companys ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". In January 2002, Standard and Poors affirmed NiSources BBB credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On December 7, 2001, Moodys Investors Service put under review for possible downgrade the short term and long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries. Moodys stated rationale for their negative ratings watch action was NiSources higher than expected overall leverage level and concerns about the effect that the weakening local economy might have on the Companys operating results. Immediately following the Moodys ratings watch action, the Companys ability to rollover maturities within the A2/P2 commercial paper market was significantly constrained. As a result, the Company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund a number of commercial paper maturities occurring subsequent to the Moodys ratings watch action. At December 31, 2001, $850.0 million of commercial paper maturities had been refinanced through NiSources revolving credit facility. On February 1, 2001, Moodys downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to the parents ratings going forward. As a split rated A2/P3 commercial paper issuer, the Company expects that its access to the commercial paper market will be significantly constrained and will meet its liquidity needs going forward by using its revolving credit facility and also terming out a portion of its short term borrowing requirements in the fixed income capital markets. Moodys also revised the Companys Outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". NiSource has entered into gas and electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $110.0 million to $115.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade below Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17 million to $35 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, has asked that NiSource post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million declining over time to support the bonds. NiSource will comply with this request. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2002. These commitments include long term debt; lease obligations, primarily operating leases related to the Companys Primary Energy subsidiaries; and unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through the Companys Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual cash obligations in existence at December 31, 2001 due pursuant to contractual commitments are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Long term debt $ 398.0 $1,199.0 $ 115.4 $1,013.7 $ 440.0 $3,152.1 Capital leases 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 1.0 Operating leases 149.8 168.1 110.5 109.3 157.9 643.2 Unconditional purchase obligations 136.2 92.8 80.8 64.8 53.2 237.5 Total contractual obligations $ 684.2 $1,460.1 $ 307.0 $1,188.1 $ 651.5 $4,033.8 NiSource also has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2002.

These figures are not directly comparable due to the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Columbias capital expenditures for the last two months are included in the 2000 financial statements. The gas distribution segments capital program in 2001 included investments to extend service to new areas and develop future markets, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers. The transmission and storage segment spent $85.7 million in 2001 to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipelines. The remaining $51.7 million was used for market development activities and new business initiatives. The electric program expenditures mainly related to adding new customers and maintaining equipment. The exploration and production segments 2001 program primarily included the drilling of 230 new wells in the Appalachian Basin and Canada. Other products and services comprised of $28.7 million for the completion of Transcoms fiber optics network, $13.0 million for investments in fuel cell technologies and the remainder for information technology improvements and infrastructure maintenance. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. For 2002, the projected capital program is expected to be $650.8 million, which is $28.4 million lower than the 2001 level. This reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of NiSource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments. The program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions. All estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility and economic trends. Enron Bankruptcy Filing On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. NiSource has certain exposure to Enron, as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to Enron at NiSources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries. Prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing, NiSource had basis and commodity swaps, pipeline transportation and storage agreements, physical commodity contracts for natural gas, electricity and coal, and SO2 trading agreements in place with Enron as the counterparty. All contracts, with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the Columbia of Ohio gas distribution subsidiary, were terminated by NiSource at the end of November 2001. NiSource recorded a pre tax charge of $17.8 million in 2001 related to the Enron bankruptcy filing. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. NiSource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes, which are ultimately dependent upon the customers supply requirements. NiSource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, $1,004.3 million and $2,078.8 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 was 3.14% and 7.44%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%, and credit facility advances (notes payable) of $417.9 million at December 31, 2000, at a weighted average interest rate of 7.78%. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, NiSource had $51.7 million and $128.5 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, $629.0 million of credit was available under the facility. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Credit Ratings On December 6, 2001 Fitch Ratings downgraded the long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc and its subsidiaries. Fitch cited weak consolidated credit coverage ratios and higher than projected debt levels at NiSource, resulting in a credit profile which was more consistent with a "BBB" rating category, rather than the previous "BBB+" rating. At the same time, Fitch also assigned a "Stable" ratings outlook for NiSource and its subsidiaries. On February 5, 2002, Fitch reaffirmed the credit ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries, but revised the Companys ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". In January 2002, Standard and Poors affirmed NiSources BBB credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On December 7, 2001, Moodys Investors Service put under review for possible downgrade the short term and long term debt ratings of NiSource Inc. and its subsidiaries. Moodys stated rationale for their negative ratings watch action was NiSources higher than expected overall leverage level and concerns about the effect that the weakening local economy might have on the Companys operating results. Immediately following the Moodys ratings watch action, the Companys ability to rollover maturities within the A2/P2 commercial paper market was significantly constrained. As a result, the Company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund a number of commercial paper maturities occurring subsequent to the Moodys ratings watch action. At December 31, 2001, $850.0 million of commercial paper maturities had been refinanced through NiSources revolving credit facility. On February 1, 2001, Moodys downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to the parents ratings going forward. As a split rated A2/P3 commercial paper issuer, the Company expects that its access to the commercial paper market will be significantly constrained and will meet its liquidity needs going forward by using its revolving credit facility and also terming out a portion of its short term borrowing requirements in the fixed income capital markets. Moodys also revised the Companys Outlook from "Stable" to "Negative". NiSource has entered into gas and electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $110.0 million to $115.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade below Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17 million to $35 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, has asked that NiSource post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million declining over time to support the bonds. NiSource will comply with this request. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia of Ohio is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, substantially all of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below investment grade, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit.

These figures are not directly comparable due to the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Columbias capital expenditures for the last two months are included in the 2000 financial statements. The gas distribution segments capital program in 2001 included investments to extend service to new areas and develop future markets, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers. The transmission and storage segment spent $85.7 million in 2001 to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipelines. The remaining $51.7 million was used for market development activities and new business initiatives. The electric program expenditures mainly related to adding new customers and maintaining equipment. The exploration and production segments 2001 program primarily included the drilling of 230 new wells in the Appalachian Basin and Canada. Other products and services comprised of $28.7 million for the completion of Transcoms fiber optics network, $13.0 million for investments in fuel cell technologies and the remainder for information technology improvements and infrastructure maintenance. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. For 2002, the projected capital program is expected to be $650.8 million, which is $28.4 million lower than the 2001 level. This reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of NiSource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments. The program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions. All estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility and economic trends. Enron Bankruptcy Filing On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. NiSource has certain exposure to Enron, as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to Enron at NiSources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries. Prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing, NiSource had basis and commodity swaps, pipeline transportation and storage agreements, physical commodity contracts for natural gas, electricity and coal, and SO2 trading agreements in place with Enron as the counterparty. All contracts, with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the Columbia of Ohio gas distribution subsidiary, were terminated by NiSource at the end of November 2001. NiSource recorded a pre tax charge of $17.8 million in 2001 related to the Enron bankruptcy filing. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. NiSource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes, which are ultimately dependent upon the customers supply requirements. NiSource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

These figures are not directly comparable due to the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Columbias capital expenditures for the last two months are included in the 2000 financial statements. The gas distribution segments capital program in 2001 included investments to extend service to new areas and develop future markets, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers. The transmission and storage segment spent $85.7 million in 2001 to ensure the safety and reliability of the pipelines. The remaining $51.7 million was used for market development activities and new business initiatives. The electric program expenditures mainly related to adding new customers and maintaining equipment. The exploration and production segments 2001 program primarily included the drilling of 230 new wells in the Appalachian Basin and Canada. Other products and services comprised of $28.7 million for the completion of Transcoms fiber optics network, $13.0 million for investments in fuel cell technologies and the remainder for information technology improvements and infrastructure maintenance. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. For 2002, the projected capital program is expected to be $650.8 million, which is $28.4 million lower than the 2001 level. This reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of NiSource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments. The program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions. All estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility and economic trends. Enron Bankruptcy Filing On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. NiSource has certain exposure to Enron, as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to Enron at NiSources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries. Prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing, NiSource had basis and commodity swaps, pipeline transportation and storage agreements, physical commodity contracts for natural gas, electricity and coal, and SO2 trading agreements in place with Enron as the counterparty. All contracts, with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the Columbia of Ohio gas distribution subsidiary, were terminated by NiSource at the end of November 2001. NiSource recorded a pre tax charge of $17.8 million in 2001 related to the Enron bankruptcy filing. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. NiSource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes, which are ultimately dependent upon the customers supply requirements. NiSource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. For 2002, the projected capital program is expected to be $650.8 million, which is $28.4 million lower than the 2001 level. This reduced spending reflects the continued commitment of NiSource to focus on optimizing return on investments at the core business segments. The program will be funded primarily from cash from operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions. All estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, industry restructuring, regulatory constraints, acquisition opportunities, market volatility and economic trends. Enron Bankruptcy Filing On December 2, 2001, Enron Corp. filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. NiSource has certain exposure to Enron, as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services to Enron at NiSources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries. Prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing, NiSource had basis and commodity swaps, pipeline transportation and storage agreements, physical commodity contracts for natural gas, electricity and coal, and SO2 trading agreements in place with Enron as the counterparty. All contracts, with the exception of the pipeline transportation and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the Columbia of Ohio gas distribution subsidiary, were terminated by NiSource at the end of November 2001. NiSource recorded a pre tax charge of $17.8 million in 2001 related to the Enron bankruptcy filing. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to risk including non trading and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity price and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. NiSource enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales price and varying volumes, which are ultimately dependent upon the customers supply requirements. NiSource utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these future supply requirements. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices. In order to help minimize this risk, NiSource has adopted a policy that requires commodity hedging activities to help ensure stable cash flow, favorable prices and margins. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $1,854.3 million and $2,496.7 million, respectively. Based upon average borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $19.4 million and $15.7 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000, respectively. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic lease agreement related to its Primary Energy subsidiary. A portion of the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate, thus exposing Primary Energy to interest rate risks. Primary Energy engages in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of the anticipated lease payments. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. In sales and trading activities, credit risk arises because of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date. In derivative activities, credit risk arises when counter parties to derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments and standby letters of credit and guarantees. Current credit exposure includes the positive fair value of derivative instruments. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. Trading Risks The transactions associated with NiSources energy trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity. The gas and power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas products on the NYMEX. The gas marketing and trading activities consists of both physical and trading activities. The power trading activities generally do not result in the physical delivery of electricity. Some contracts within the trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery, but are net settled in accordance with industry standards. NiSource employs a VaR model to assess the market risk of its energy trading portfolios. Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across all trading groups that utilize derivatives using either Monte Carlo simulation or variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $1.1 million, $3.7 million and effectively zero, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The daily VaR for the gas trading portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.9 million, $4.7 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. Trading Contracts A summary of the activity affecting the change in fair value of NiSources trading contracts during 2001 is as follows: (in millions) 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 22.5 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (62.2) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 64.5 Other changes in fair values during the period (15.9) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 8.9 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the sources of the valuations of the contracts at December 31, 2001 and the years in which they mature are: (in millions) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Prices actively quoted $0.8 $0.5 $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources (1.2) 4.3 2.4 0.5 0.2 Prices based on models/other method 1.6 (0.2) Total fair values $1.2 $4.6 $2.4 $0.5 $0.2 $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17 million. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle component of OCI were reclassified into earnings during 2001. Refer to "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for Risk Management Activities" and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $751.3 million and $82.7 million at December 31, 2001, and $970.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2000, respectively. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If NiSource would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would have to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $278.4 million and $196.6 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. SFAS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $66.0 million of price risk management assets and $10.3 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $50.1 million at December 31, 2001. 23 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 98 10 ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 are recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). EITF No. 98 10 indicates that when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts. The related gains and losses should be included currently in earnings. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under EITF No. 98 10. Pursuant to the requirements of EITF No. 98 10, NiSource records the results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings. The assessment of fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchange traded contracts. NiSource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the origination of its trading deals. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, NiSource reflected $252.3 million and $1,591.1 million of price risk management assets and $243.4 million and $1,568.6 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. Trading revenues, net of cost of sales, were $59.3 million, $24.5 million and $9.6 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 97 10 THE EFFECT OF LESSEE INVOLVEMENT IN ASSET CONSTRUCTION. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97 10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10), provides the accounting requirements for situations in which an entity (lessee) is involved on behalf of an owner (lessor) with the construction of an asset that will be leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed. Various forms of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the lessee is, in substance, the owner of the asset for financial reporting purposes. Generally, the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks. If the lessee is considered the owner of the asset during the construction period, a sale and leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the lease term begins. In these synthetic lease situations, the owner lessor is generally a special purpose entity. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90 15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" (EITF No. 90 15), these special purpose entities are not consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three percent of the entities capitalization. If the three percent test is met, the constructed asset and related debt, if any, are not included in the lessees consolidated financial statements. Primary Energy has projects that are accounted for under EITF No. 97 10 and EITF No. 90 15. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. NiSource does not consolidate the assets or related debt in its consolidated financial statements. Competition The regulatory environment applicable to NiSources subsidiaries continues to undergo fundamental changes. These changes have previously had, and will continue to have an impact on NiSources operations, structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the energy industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment. These initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major industrial customers, providing its customers with increased choice for new products and services, acquiring companies that increase NiSources scale of operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energy related products for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including the development of distributed generation technologies. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. has had pervasive negative impacts on several U.S. industries and on the U.S. economy in general. While NiSource was not directly impacted by the event, the Company believes that it has been impacted indirectly. Since the incident, NiSource has noted evidence of substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy insurance market. The Company expects the cost of its insurance and related deductibles to be higher than they were previously, when much of its insurance is renewed in July 2002. Other indirect impacts of the September 11 incident include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of NiSources industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and security. Presentation of Segment Information As a result of the November 1, 2000 acquisition of Columbia, NiSource revised its presentation of primary business segment information. Columbias gas transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now reported as business segments of NiSource. Columbias gas distribution operations have been combined with NiSources gas distribution business. During 2001, NiSource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned operating structure. The realignment affected three previously reported segments, and included moving all ongoing operations of Energy Marketing and certain operations from the Electric Operations and Other segments to the newly created Merchant Operations segment. The electric wheeling, bulk power, and power trading operations were moved from the Electric Operations segment to Merchant Operations, and the Companys Primary Energy subsidiary, which develops on site, industrial based energy solutions, was moved from Other to Merchant Operations. All periods presented reflect these changes. The business segment information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies adopted by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. 24 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7.

Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the Electric Operations segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. Regulatory Matters The gas industry deregulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for several years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 700,000 of Gas Distributions 3.2 million customers have selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, decontracting of pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia of Ohio) that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. The new rules are expected to become effective in mid 2002. A number of parties, including Columbia of Ohio, have requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules. The PUCO has granted a rehearing. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia of Kentucky is required to file a rate case that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on customers bills merger savings. Northern Utilities, New Hampshire Division, filed a general rate case in November 2001. The filing proposes an increase in revenue of $3.8 million or approximately 7.4% of annual operating revenues. On February 7, 2002, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) granted an interim rate increase of approximately $2.3 million. Actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent rates at the conclusion of the general rate case. On August 11, 1999, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on September 1, 2001. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, more transparent pricing, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and file settlements, which have generally been approved by FERC. The major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised pro forma compliance filings, which continue to be protested by the majority of their customers. Those filings have been awaiting FERC action since early last fall. Based upon early orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings, Gas Distribution believes that implementation of Order 637 will begin to take place prior to the winter of 2002 2003. Not all of the pipelines serving Gas Distribution have resolved their Order 637 proceedings; however, FERCs recent clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of Order 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations. Gas Distribution is evaluating those effects, but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that full implementation of Order No. 637 will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks, and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released at various facilities. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs.

Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities.

Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of four waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other three, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The investigation has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 42 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 19 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1 "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No.96 1). As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $68.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. MERCURY PROGRAM. Until the 1960s, gas regulators containing small quantities of mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems. The purpose of these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the service line for use inside of the home. In 2000, several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with NiSource were involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury. A number of the NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas regulators that contained small quantities of mercury. All NiSource Gas Distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate, maintain and or remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury, including procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly cleaned up. To date no material problems associated with past or current use or removal of mercury regulators have been identified. As a result, NiSource believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its Gas Distribution subsidiaries. Market Conditions The recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced production and fuel switching (to coal, #6 oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 Bcf. The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In the winter of 2000 2001, spot prices for gas purchases exceeded $6.00/dth. The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas for many companies during the 2000 2001 winter season. Spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid $2.00/dth range; prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s. Entering this winter, storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic downturn, reduced demand for gas driven electric power generation and increased natural gas drilling activity. Given the high storage levels in place mid way through this winter, the current price levels are expected to continue through this winter season. The higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in 1999. By mid 2001, this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling activity since the early 1980s. However, with the drop in prices since last winter, that trend in drilling has turned around, with about 26% fewer active rigs in December 2001 compared to the high experienced in July 2001, and about 6% fewer compared to a year ago in December 2000. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer billings. The impact of the higher gas costs on Gas Distribution customers bills and bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the $13.1 million, or 22%, increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001. In Ohio, regulatory approval was given to defer $19.5 million of current year uncollectible expense, representing the excess of current year expense over the amounts collected in base rates. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as the transportation of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Gas Distribution generated $42.2 in net revenues from various non traditional sales and incentive programs in 2001, a $38.7 million increase over the prior year. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territory was 12% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (Mdth) versus prior year and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million from prior year. Weather in 2000 and 1999 was 18% and 8%, respectively, warmer than normal. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 1,007.5 MDth for 2001 increased 468.1 MDth from 2000. Columbias five Gas Distribution companies contributed 550.8 MDth additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on the industrial demand, primarily the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 Mdth. Throughput for 2000 of 539.4 MDth increased 88.8 MDth from 1999, due to the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Net Revenues Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $704.5 million, partially offset by a decline of approximately $63.0 million as a result of warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, higher uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the 2000 2001 heating period. This negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. Operating income of $241.0 million for 2000 increased $127.0 million over 1999 reflecting two months of Columbias operations and the full year effect of Bay State operations. Tempering these improvements was $16.9 million of expense in 2000 for the write down of certain assets in preparation for sale and approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Columbia, restructuring costs and higher employee related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by lower customer related expenses. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700,000 Dth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations are obtained. Furthermore, the certificate requires that the Millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the date of the order. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion of the available capacity. In light of the changing market environment, Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing their needs. The sponsors of the proposed Millennium Project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc., TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Sale of Facilities Columbia Transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of non core assets. Columbia Transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of small diameter pipelines and other facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects During 2001, Columbia Transmission began providing up to 629,000 dekatherms a day (Dth/d) to serve five new electric generating facilities. Columbia Transmission has also requested permission from the FERC to construct facilities to provide up to 260,000 Dth/d to two electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Effect of LDC Unbundling Services NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage subsidiaries compete with other interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas. Since the issuance of FERC Order No. 636, various states throughout Columbia Transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access and unbundling of LDC services. Among other things, unbundling involves providing all LDCs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as well as merchant supplier. While the scope and timing of these various unbundling initiatives varies from state to state, retail choice programs are being extended to LDC customers throughout Columbia Transmissions market area. Among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have underpinned the traditional LDC merchant function. In the case of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf, contracts covering the majority of their firm transportation and storage quantities with LDCs have primary terms that extend to October 31, 2004. Management fully expects that the LDCs, or those entities to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the LDC unbundling process, will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts. However, in view of the changing market and regulatory environment, NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage companies have commenced the process of discussing long term transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers. Those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 EPA Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. As of December 31, 2001, field characterization has been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. Columbia Transmission is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are completed and approved by the EPA and additional remediation work is performed, Columbia Transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At the end of 2001, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet for Gas Transmission and Storage operations was $ 90.5 million. Columbia Transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 12.5 million in 2002. These expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the long time period over which expenditures will be made. Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 1, 2001, Columbia Transmission made its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing with the FERC to revise the retainage percentages applicable to its tariff services to be effective April 2, 2001, based on actual activity for the calendar year 2000, and projected activity over the 12 month period commencing April 1. On March 28, 2001, the FERC accepted and suspended the filing, subject to refund and further review, and noted the increase in the actual level of lost and unaccounted for gas during 2000. On April 30, 2001, in response to the March 28, 2001 order, Columbia Transmission submitted responses to certain questions asked by the FERC with respect to the companys March 1 filing. In its responses, Columbia Transmission agreed to review certain factors that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas for calendar year 2000, and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken to mitigate future losses. Columbia Transmission filed a report with the FERC on October 31, 2001, setting forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccounted for gas. On the same date, Columbia Transmission made a supplemental filing with the FERC to decrease the transportation retainage percentage level established in the March 1 filing. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued an order accepting the companys April 30 and October 31 filings. The order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual filing on March 1, 2002. Request for rehearing of the FERCs December 19 order have been filed. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material effect on NiSources financial position. Storage Base Gas Sales Columbia Transmission sold 5.4 (MDth) of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting in a pre tax gain of $11.4 million. Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $137.4 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately $132.3 million in 2002. New business initiatives totaled approximately $51.7 million in 2001 and are expected to be $58.3 million in 2002. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.4 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase primarily reflects the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $712.6 million from 2000. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 was an increase of $301.4 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 34 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

These changes will continue to have an impact on NiSources Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing environment, including shutting down inefficient generating plant, converting some of its generating units to allow use of lower cost, low sulfur coal and improving the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. The overall weakening of the U.S. economy is reflected in the 559.4 gigawatt hour (gwh) decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001 versus 2000. In particular, the steel and steel related industries have been adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions, with two major customers (LTV Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp.) declaring bankruptcy. Overall deliveries to the steel industry were down 345.8 gwh in 2001 versus the prior year. Additionally, uncollectible expense in the current year was $2.4 million higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16% warmer in 2001 than the prior summer, causing a 130.3 kwh increase in sales to residential and commercial class customers. However, the positive impact of the warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter heating season, resulting in an annual 11% increase in cooling degree days and a 74.0 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring In December 2001, NiSource announced a restructuring program designed to generate greater efficiencies in field operations, customer contact centers and administrative support staff throughout various Gas Distribution and Electric Operations companies. In October 2001, NiSource executed a reorganization of sales and marketing functions. The current year results include $28.7 million in expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs. Of this total, $22.5 million was included in the Gas Distribution segment operating results with the remainder included in the electric segment results. The programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field operations, contact centers, administrative support and sales and marketing functions throughout the NiSource Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segment companies. As part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric demand, the Mitchell Station, with a net capacity of 502 mw, will be shutdown by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Originally constructed in 1955, this facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient station in the Northern Indiana electric production system. In addition to the high level of ongoing maintenance costs, there are substantial capital investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards. Costs totaling $2.2 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant shutdown. These costs for employee reductions are included in the $28.7 restructuring charge. Regulatory Matters In 1999, FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). The Alliance RTO is actively negotiating to become a part of the MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $5.6 million related to joining the Alliance RTO. The Company believes that the amounts spent will be recoverable. Also, FERC has indicated that a December 15, 2001 start date for RTOs was not achievable and no alternative date has been proposed. Although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of Northern Indianas electricity sales, it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services. Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The recovery provides for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before recovery is approved. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. During the course of a regularly scheduled review, referred to as a Level 1 review, the staff of the IURC made a preliminary determination, based on unadjusted historical financial information filed by Northern Indiana, that Northern Indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order and generally established standards. Despite efforts to explain to the IURC staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to make such an analysis meaningful, the staff recommended that a formal investigation be performed. During 2001, Northern Indiana and several other parties filed testimony, participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms of the order and comments on these proposed orders. Northern Indianas testimony indicated that if rates are to be changed, they should be increased. 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Environmental Matters AIR. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which became fully effective in 2000. All of Northern Indianas facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and NOx limits. During 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule, the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call, requiring certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers. The EPA stated that the intent of the rule is to lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the federal ozone standard. Consistent with EPA requirements, the State of Indiana developed regulations implementing the control program, which became effective September 16, 2001. The EPA approved the state rules effective December 10, 2001. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the CAAAs acid rain NOx reduction program described above. Capital estimates of Northern Indianas NOx control compliance costs range from $200 to $300 million over the next 2 years. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. In a matter related to the NOx SIP call, several northeastern states have filed petitions with the EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petitions allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the Midwest that allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states. NiSource is monitoring the EPAs decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce NOx emissions at Northern Indianas electric facilities. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the new rules for both ozone and particulate matters to the EPA. The Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on November 7, 2000. The Supreme Court rendered a complex ruling on February 27, 2001 that will require some issues to be resolved by the D.C. Circuit Court and the EPA before final rulemaking occurs. Consequently, final rules specifying a compliance level, deadline, and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the near future. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations) beyond measures discussed above. Final implementation methods will be set by the EPA as well as state regulatory authorities. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area; however, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Northern Indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information requests from the EPA on this subject. It is impossible at this time to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7.

Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease.

This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" or BART. The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative ("GLI") program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the EPA/IDEM agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption may be subject to future litigation. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending the outcome of litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements, the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at four waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage, and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2001, a reserve of approximately $2.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. Sales Electric sales for 2001 of 15,489.5 gwh decreased 491.8 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. In 2000, electric sales of 15,981.3 gwh increased 305.6 gwh from 1999. Net Revenues Electric net revenues of $754.6 million for 2001 decreased by $4.7 million from 2000, primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment. The positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by slightly cooler weather in the third quarter. In 2000, electric net revenues of $759.3 million were relatively unchanged from 1999. Operating Income Operating income for 2001 was $309.6 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from 2000. This is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.4 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million and restructuring charges of $6.2 million. Operating income for 2000 was $315.7 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 1999. This was due to higher operating expenses, attributable to generally increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of additional plant in service. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower other taxes. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC.

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000.

Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives. As a result of the voluntary agreement with the Philadelphia District and communications with the PA 44 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) DEP, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers, work in Pennsylvania and Maryland was allowed to be continued and has been completed. On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, except for property acquisition costs, only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties, wells and related equipment and facilities, support equipment, and uncompleted wells. Depletion expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the reserves on a lease basis. Compared to the full cost method, the change to successful efforts reduced operating income by $5.3 million and $10.3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Forward Sale of Natural Gas In 1999 and 2000, a subsidiary of Columbia Resources entered into agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia), whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 156.7 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia for the period February 2000 through July 2005. On March 30, 2001, the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 19.9 Bcf of natural gas originally scheduled for the period April 2001 through March 2002. These deliveries have been scheduled to resume in January 2003 and continue through February 2006. The restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be delivered by 31.7 Bcf. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The forward sales under the Mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately $294.0 million declining over time. The surety bonds have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $294.0 million declining over time. Volumes Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 53,100 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Approximately 92% of Columbia Resources natural gas production was hedged at an average price of $4.04 per million cubic feet (Mcf) for the twelve month period compared to an average hedged price of $3.98 per Mcf in 2000.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term. One strategy is to attempt to refinance the property and extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the Lessees were to purchase all the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM.

OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued.

Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business.

Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays have also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately $20 million of additional funding. Primary Energy has asserted a claim against the construction contractor relating to the delay. The project is expected to be capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002, at a total cost of approximately $320 million. In addition to the construction issues at the Whiting Clean Energy facility, NiSource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets. For 2002, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $16.0 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. Primary Energys Ironside project at LTV Steel Companys East Chicago, Indiana mill has been negatively impacted by LTVs bankruptcy filing in December 2000 and LTVs December 2001 decision to idle the steel mill. The Ironside facility is complete in all material respects. However, the facility cannot currently be operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating. In addition, there can be no guarantee that LTV will not reject the project contracts in connection with the bankruptcy, in which event the Lessee will have limited contract damages against LTV and the status of an unsecured creditor. Primary Energy believes that the Ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at attractive prices. However, there can be no assurance that any successor to LTV will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic basis to Primary Energy. The winner of the bids for the purchase of LTVs steel mill will be determined on February 28, 2002. The total cost of the Ironside project is approximately $67 million. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project is due to expire in June 2002. Of the several options available, the most likely outcomes are that the project will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the Lessee will purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately $38 million. If the Lessee purchases the project, the payment will be funded by NiSource. The strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing. 42 ITEM 7.

This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives.

OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses.

Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees, sublease payments, unit sale payments or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and steam for industrial use. Each project is developed by a wholly owned subsidiary (the "Lessee") of Primary Energy. The Lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a non affiliated special purpose entity (the "Lessor"), which owns the facility and advances the funds for construction. The Lessor obtains funding primarily from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes, secured by the Lessors rights in the facility. The indebtedness of the Lessor is not treated as indebtedness of NiSource under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The lease payments from the Lessee to the Lessor are based on a return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced. With respect to three of the projects, the costs of the project financing depend on the debt rating on NiSources outstanding commercial paper or long term debt. The projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to long term ground leases. The responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the industrial customers for two of the projects and with the Lessee on the remaining projects. Where the Lessee is responsible for the operation and maintenance, it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation and maintenance activities. NiSource, either directly or through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at December 31, 2001 was $629.7 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the Lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the 41 ITEM 7.

In September and October 2000, management held discussions with investment banking firms seeking strategic options for the Transcom assets. Although significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete the fiber optic network, time to market in a competitive environment, and delays due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues, management decided to complete the Transcom network and sell the completed network. The Company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated construction costs and delays. Consequently, management concluded that the carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by approximately $89.2 million. Consequently, goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess carrying amount ($52.0 million after tax). In August 2001, Transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets. Based on these bids, present market conditions preclude Transcom from realizing the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time. Therefore management has decided to operate the network, while continuing to evaluate market conditions for possible sale. At December 31, 2001, the anticipated cash flow from Transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying value is realizable. However, economic and other events may adversely affect the Transcoms ability to achieve such plan. Sale of Underground Locating and Marking Service On January 28, 2002, NiSource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SM&P, a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource, to The Laclede Group, Inc. for $37.9 million. SM&P operates an underground locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource will recognize an after tax gain of $10.3 million related to the sale. The net assets of SM&P were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. Environmental Matters TRANSCOM. In spring 2000, Transcom received directives from the Philadelphia District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Philadelphia District) and an administrative order from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from construction activities associated with Transcoms laying fiber optic cable along portions of a route between Washington, D.C. and New York City. The order and directives required Transcom to largely cease construction activities. On September 18, 2000, Transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the Philadelphia District under which Transcom contributed $1.2 million to the Pennsylvania chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the Philadelphia District lifted its directives.

On October 25, 2001, Transcom entered into a Consent Order and Agreement with the PA DEP in settlement of its enforcement action under which Transcom paid $80,633 in penalties and $223,567 to fund six community environmental projects. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some its former companies, including Columbia Propane, Columbia Petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. The primary environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site in Wisconsin for which reserves have been accrued. Environmental liability associated with former petroleum operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party properties and liability for pre existing environmental conditions at former petroleum terminals. A NiSource affiliate also retains liability for two former MGP sites associated with a local gas distribution company in New York, for which reserves have been accrued. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $46.1 million for 2001 decreased by $27.9 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Net operating revenues of $74.0 million for 2000 increased by $9.7 million from 1999. This increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $67.2 million in 2001 versus an operating loss of $28.0 million in 2000, reflecting the impairment of telecommunication assets, the settlement of litigation related to Market Hub Partners (MHP) which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down non core businesses. Other reported an operating loss of $28.0 million for 2000 versus an operating loss of $7.3 million in 1999. 45 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. MERCHANT OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2002 3.4 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 After 19.5 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $34.7 million as of December 31, 2001. Net Revenues Net revenues of $113.0 million for 2001 decreased $40.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities. This decrease is partially offset by increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring electric companies and increases in power marketing. Net revenues for 2000 were $153.8 million, compared to $109.6 million in 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. TPC was acquired in April 1999. Operating Income Merchant Operations reported operating income of $22.2 million, a decrease of $56.8 million from 2000. The reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. Operating income of $79.0 million in 2000 was an increase of $29.5 million from 1999. The improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management contracts in the TPC portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of TPC operations. 43 ITEM 7.
