The Managements Discussion and Analysis, including statements regarding market risk sensitive instruments, contains "forward looking statements," within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning NiSources plans, proposed dispositions, objectives, expected performance, expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates, stated on either a consolidated or segment basis, and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. From time to time, NiSource may publish or otherwise make available forward looking statements of this nature. All such subsequent forward looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of NiSource, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially. Realization of NiSources objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks and can be adversely affected by, among other things, increased competition in deregulated energy markets, weather, fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities, successful consummation of proposed acquisitions and dispositions, growth opportunities for NiSources regulated and nonregulated businesses, dealings with third parties over whom NiSource has no control, actual operating experience of acquired assets, NiSources ability to integrate acquired operations into its operations, the regulatory process, regulatory and legislative changes, changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions, and counter party credit risk, many of which risks are beyond the control of NiSource. In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. CONSOLIDATED REVIEW The Consolidated Review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource and discussed in "Other Information" of this Item 7. Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $425.7 million, or $2.02 per share, compared to $226.4 million, or $1.10 per share, in 2001 and $141.9 million, or $1.05 per share in 2000. All per share amounts are based on basic common shares. Including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting affecting the 2001 period, NiSource reported 2002 net income of $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share, 2001 net income of $216.2 million, or $1.05 per share, and $150.9 million, or $1.12 per share for 2000. The results for 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000 are not comparable due to the acquisition of Columbia that was completed on November 1, 2000. The results for 2002 and 2001 included twelve months of Columbia operations while 2000 included November and December only. In addition, earnings per share are not comparable because of an equity offering of 41.4 million shares that was completed in November 2002, an equity offering of approximately 11.5 million shares that was completed in November 2000, and the issuance of 72.5 million shares of additional NiSource shares in connection with the Columbia acquisition. 13 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 were $3,329.0 million, a $77.9 million decrease compared with 2001. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to reduced off system sales, incentive programs and non weather related gas sales totaling $41.5 million; lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements amounting to $32.7 million; issued credits totaling $28.1 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement; $12.9 million from scaling back the energy trading operations and an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas. Slightly offsetting the decrease was a $36.6 million impact of favorable weather due to a much colder fall heating season, which increased natural gas sales and deliveries, and a warmer summer cooling season that positively impacted electric sales. Net revenues for 2001 of $3,406.9 million increased $1,459.2 million over 2000. The increase, primarily attributable to the inclusion of twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000, was reduced by approximately $63.0 million from record setting warmer than normal weather during the heating season. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,126.3 million in 2002, a $247.7 million decrease from 2001. A portion of the decrease was attributable to a $150.0 million reduction in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employee related, support services and facilities expenses of $35.4 million resulting from reorganization initiatives; insurance recoveries of environmental expenses totaling $24.5 million; a reversal of $30.3 million in reserves for estimated taxes and environmental expenditures; reduced dry well and geological expenses of $17.8 million; and a reduction of $16.8 million from reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The 2001 period was unfavorably impacted by the $15.5 million litigation settlement related to Market Hub Partners, L.P. (MHP). Also contributing to the decrease was the elimination of $93.1 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standard that affected goodwill amortization beginning January 1, 2002 and $27.1 million primarily from gains on the sales of NiSources utility line locating and marking business and a significant portion of TPCs gas trading contracts. For 2002, employee related expenses were increased by higher pension and post retirement benefits expense resulting from a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate used to value the liabilities. 2001 pension expense was further impacted by a flat return on plan assets in 2001 versus the expected 9% return. Due to poor performance in world equity markets during 2002, and resulting negative returns on plan assets, 2003 pension expense is expected to increase $42.8 million over the 2002 level. Operating expenses of $2,374.0 million for 2001 increased $1,038.6 million over 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. In addition, 2001 was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of $28.7 million, uncollectibles of $17.8 million related to the Enron bankruptcy, an increase in other uncollectible customer accounts of $13.1 million and a one time charge of $15.5 million related to the settlement of the MHP litigation. Other transition and one time events increased operating expenses $21.7 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of $93.1 million for twelve months attributable to the Columbia acquisition compared to $15.0 million for two months in 2000. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2002 reduced income $543.1 million compared to a reduction of $615.7 million in 2001. Interest expense, net decreased $71.9 million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of $1.4 billion resulting from proceeds from the sale of 41.4 million shares of common stock, approximating $734.9 million, the sales of IWCR and SM&P and positive operating cash flows. Lower short term interest rates also contributed to the decrease. See Notes 15 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, was $20.4 million in both 2002 and 2001. 14 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Other Income (Deductions) in 2001 reduced income $615.7 million compared to a reduction in 2000 of $344.1 million. Interest expense, net increased $293.5 million over 2000 primarily due to the full year effect of interest on outstanding Columbia debt and the debt incurred for the acquisition, partly offset by a decrease in interest rates on short term borrowings. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities was $20.4 million in both 2001 and 2000. Other, net increased income $10.2 million in 2001 and decreased income $11.4 million in 2000. The 2000 period included a charitable donation of facilities. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $43.1 million in 2002 as compared with 2001 and increased $64.5 million in 2001 over 2000 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.5 %, 45.7% and 47.1% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate in 2002 versus the previous year was due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of $53.2 million, or a loss of 25 cents per share, in 2002 compared to an after tax loss of $14.2 million, or loss of 7 cents per share, in 2001 and income of $9.0 million, or 7 cents per share, in 2000. The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. The loss in the 2001 period was primarily related to the results of Transcoms operations, including an impairment charge of $5.7 million, after tax. The 2000 period primarily reflects the operations of the water utilities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. In the summer months, cash receipts from electric sales normally exceed cash requirements. Also, during the summer months, cash on hand, together with external short term and long term financing, is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Net cash from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 was $1,172.4 million. Cash generated from working capital was $165.6 million, principally driven by reductions in inventories and gas receivables, partly offset by payments for current liabilities and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed the underlying securities. NiSource received the net proceeds of the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligation under the forward equity agreements. The purchaser of the remarketed securities purchased 6.15% notes due in 2013 using the debentures for consideration. On January 28, 2003, NiSource announced that its subsidiary CNR had sold its interest in a natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York State for $95 million to an undisclosed buyer. The proceeds were used to reduce short term debt. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. NiSource plans to redeem $75 million of Capital Markets, 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026 by the end of the first quarter 2003. 15 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSource plans to refinance approximately $1.2 billion of expiring long term debt during 2003 with additional proceeds from asset sales and new debt issuances by its financing subsidiary NiSource Finance. Credit Facilities During March 2002, NiSource Finance negotiated a $500 million 364 day credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, led by Barclays Capital, which expires on March 20, 2003. This facility replaced the expiring $1.25 billion 364 day credit facility and complements NiSources existing $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004. NiSource will not renew the 364 day facility, which expires on March 20, 2003. In addition, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 is being amended to allow for the aggregate letters of credit outstanding under this agreement to be increased from $150 million to $400 million. The reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the sales IWCR, SM&P and the exploration and production joint venture, the proceeds from the November 2002 equity offering, and positive operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, $150.0 million and $1,004.3 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 2.25% and 3.14%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%, and credit facility advances of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource had $171.7 million and $51.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, $665.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Credit Ratings During January 2002, Standard and Poors reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On February 1, 2002, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3 with a negative outlook. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated NiSource subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to NiSources ratings going forward. On February 5, 2002, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its F2 commercial paper rating, but revised NiSources ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative." On November 27, 2002, NiSource completed an equity offering, realizing $734.9 million in net proceeds, which were used for the repayment of debt. The equity offering significantly improved NiSources financial position by reducing its debt leverage ratios. In addition, NiSource expects to further reduce leverage by using the proceeds from the recent sale of its natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York to reduce outstanding debt. While the rating agencies stated that they have welcomed NiSources recent actions to reduce financial leverage, additional balance sheet improvement measures may be necessary to either secure a ratings upgrade or to improve the current ratings outlook. TPC has entered into electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade to Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17.0 million to $34.0 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $270.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $270.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Ohio) is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, a majority of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below BB or Ba2, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2002, Columbia of Ohio has sold $99.5 million to the conduit. Northern Indiana may sell up to $100.0 million of certain of its accounts receivable under a sales agreement, without recourse, which expires in May 2003. Northern Indiana plans to renew the agreement in May of 2003. Northern Indiana has sold $100.0 million under this agreement. Under this agreement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2003. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through NiSources Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2002 were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Long term debt $ 1,224.7 $ 142.6 $ 1,321.6 $ 193.8 $ 394.4 $ 2,918.8 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.2 Capital leases 7.9 57.6 7.3 7.8 7.9 89.9 Operating leases 56.3 51.1 47.6 45.0 43.6 173.9 Purchase obligations 144.3 202.0 156.4 119.3 107.2 596.7 Total contractual obligations $ 1,433.8 $ 454.2 $ 1,533.8 $ 366.8 $ 554.0 $ 3,779.5 NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2003. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2002 and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Lines of credit $ 150.0 $ 763.1 $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 52.9 4.9 1.2 117.0 Guarantees 1,642.6 131.9 1,042.2 1,077.8 76.9 2,154.7 Total commercial commitments $ 1,845.5 $ 899.9 $ 1,043.4 $ 1,077.8 $ 76.9 $ 2,271.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.8 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2002 and 2001 and an estimate for year 2003: (in millions) 2003E 2002 2001 Gas Distribution $ 195.6 $ 196.4 $ 211.3 Transmission & Storage 135.7 128.0 137.4 Electric 214.5 197.8 134.7 Exploration & Production 82.5 90.8 118.8 Other 19.5 5.9 77.0 Total $ 647.8 $ 618.9 $ 679.2 For 2002, capital expenditures were $618.9 million, a decrease of $60.3 million over 2001. The Gas Distribution segments capital program in 2002 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Transmission and Storage segment invested $128.0 million in 2002 primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Companies within the Other segment invested $5.9 million in energy technologies. For 2003, the projected capital program is expected to be $647.8 million, which is $28.9 million higher than the 2002 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for NOx compliance, a portion of which will be recovered through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Pension Funding Due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and a lower assumed discount rate, NiSources pension plans are currently in an underfunded position. Although NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term rate. Also, NiSource expects pension expense for 2003 to increase $42.8 million over the amount recognized in 2002. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Prior to the sale, TPCs operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility, marketing a portion of the gas produced from NiSources exploration and production operations, and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2002, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $913.1 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of Columbias long term debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new "receive fixed" and "pay floating" interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month LIBOR BBA plus 2.66% per annum. In total, Columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on $663.0 million of its long term debt. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2002 and 2001, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $17.5 million and $23.2 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. NiSources Primary Energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate, and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps expired June 30, 2002 and subsequently, upon lease termination at December 31, 2002, Primary Energy purchased the previously leased facilities. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage. Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into five primary business segments; Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Exploration and Production, and Other. 23 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Net Revenues Total consolidated net revenues (gross revenues less cost of sales) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 were $3,329.0 million, a $77.9 million decrease compared with 2001. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to reduced off system sales, incentive programs and non weather related gas sales totaling $41.5 million; lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements amounting to $32.7 million; issued credits totaling $28.1 million pertaining to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement; $12.9 million from scaling back the energy trading operations and an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas. Slightly offsetting the decrease was a $36.6 million impact of favorable weather due to a much colder fall heating season, which increased natural gas sales and deliveries, and a warmer summer cooling season that positively impacted electric sales. Net revenues for 2001 of $3,406.9 million increased $1,459.2 million over 2000. The increase, primarily attributable to the inclusion of twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000, was reduced by approximately $63.0 million from record setting warmer than normal weather during the heating season. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,126.3 million in 2002, a $247.7 million decrease from 2001. A portion of the decrease was attributable to a $150.0 million reduction in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employee related, support services and facilities expenses of $35.4 million resulting from reorganization initiatives; insurance recoveries of environmental expenses totaling $24.5 million; a reversal of $30.3 million in reserves for estimated taxes and environmental expenditures; reduced dry well and geological expenses of $17.8 million; and a reduction of $16.8 million from reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The 2001 period was unfavorably impacted by the $15.5 million litigation settlement related to Market Hub Partners, L.P. (MHP). Also contributing to the decrease was the elimination of $93.1 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standard that affected goodwill amortization beginning January 1, 2002 and $27.1 million primarily from gains on the sales of NiSources utility line locating and marking business and a significant portion of TPCs gas trading contracts. For 2002, employee related expenses were increased by higher pension and post retirement benefits expense resulting from a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate used to value the liabilities. 2001 pension expense was further impacted by a flat return on plan assets in 2001 versus the expected 9% return. Due to poor performance in world equity markets during 2002, and resulting negative returns on plan assets, 2003 pension expense is expected to increase $42.8 million over the 2002 level. Operating expenses of $2,374.0 million for 2001 increased $1,038.6 million over 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of Columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. In addition, 2001 was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of $28.7 million, uncollectibles of $17.8 million related to the Enron bankruptcy, an increase in other uncollectible customer accounts of $13.1 million and a one time charge of $15.5 million related to the settlement of the MHP litigation. Other transition and one time events increased operating expenses $21.7 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of $93.1 million for twelve months attributable to the Columbia acquisition compared to $15.0 million for two months in 2000. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2002 reduced income $543.1 million compared to a reduction of $615.7 million in 2001. Interest expense, net decreased $71.9 million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of $1.4 billion resulting from proceeds from the sale of 41.4 million shares of common stock, approximating $734.9 million, the sales of IWCR and SM&P and positive operating cash flows. Lower short term interest rates also contributed to the decrease. See Notes 15 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, was $20.4 million in both 2002 and 2001. 14 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Other Income (Deductions) in 2001 reduced income $615.7 million compared to a reduction in 2000 of $344.1 million. Interest expense, net increased $293.5 million over 2000 primarily due to the full year effect of interest on outstanding Columbia debt and the debt incurred for the acquisition, partly offset by a decrease in interest rates on short term borrowings. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities was $20.4 million in both 2001 and 2000. Other, net increased income $10.2 million in 2001 and decreased income $11.4 million in 2000. The 2000 period included a charitable donation of facilities. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $43.1 million in 2002 as compared with 2001 and increased $64.5 million in 2001 over 2000 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.5 %, 45.7% and 47.1% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate in 2002 versus the previous year was due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of $53.2 million, or a loss of 25 cents per share, in 2002 compared to an after tax loss of $14.2 million, or loss of 7 cents per share, in 2001 and income of $9.0 million, or 7 cents per share, in 2000. The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. The loss in the 2001 period was primarily related to the results of Transcoms operations, including an impairment charge of $5.7 million, after tax. The 2000 period primarily reflects the operations of the water utilities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. In the summer months, cash receipts from electric sales normally exceed cash requirements. Also, during the summer months, cash on hand, together with external short term and long term financing, is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Net cash from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 was $1,172.4 million. Cash generated from working capital was $165.6 million, principally driven by reductions in inventories and gas receivables, partly offset by payments for current liabilities and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed the underlying securities. NiSource received the net proceeds of the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligation under the forward equity agreements. The purchaser of the remarketed securities purchased 6.15% notes due in 2013 using the debentures for consideration. On January 28, 2003, NiSource announced that its subsidiary CNR had sold its interest in a natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York State for $95 million to an undisclosed buyer. The proceeds were used to reduce short term debt. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. NiSource plans to redeem $75 million of Capital Markets, 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026 by the end of the first quarter 2003. 15 ITEM 7.

NiSource plans to refinance approximately $1.2 billion of expiring long term debt during 2003 with additional proceeds from asset sales and new debt issuances by its financing subsidiary NiSource Finance. Credit Facilities During March 2002, NiSource Finance negotiated a $500 million 364 day credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, led by Barclays Capital, which expires on March 20, 2003. This facility replaced the expiring $1.25 billion 364 day credit facility and complements NiSources existing $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004. NiSource will not renew the 364 day facility, which expires on March 20, 2003. In addition, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 is being amended to allow for the aggregate letters of credit outstanding under this agreement to be increased from $150 million to $400 million. The reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the sales IWCR, SM&P and the exploration and production joint venture, the proceeds from the November 2002 equity offering, and positive operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, $150.0 million and $1,004.3 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 2.25% and 3.14%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%, and credit facility advances of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource had $171.7 million and $51.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, $665.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Credit Ratings During January 2002, Standard and Poors reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On February 1, 2002, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3 with a negative outlook. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated NiSource subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to NiSources ratings going forward. On February 5, 2002, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its F2 commercial paper rating, but revised NiSources ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative." On November 27, 2002, NiSource completed an equity offering, realizing $734.9 million in net proceeds, which were used for the repayment of debt. The equity offering significantly improved NiSources financial position by reducing its debt leverage ratios. In addition, NiSource expects to further reduce leverage by using the proceeds from the recent sale of its natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York to reduce outstanding debt. While the rating agencies stated that they have welcomed NiSources recent actions to reduce financial leverage, additional balance sheet improvement measures may be necessary to either secure a ratings upgrade or to improve the current ratings outlook. TPC has entered into electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade to Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17.0 million to $34.0 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $270.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $270.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Ohio) is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, a majority of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below BB or Ba2, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2002, Columbia of Ohio has sold $99.5 million to the conduit. Northern Indiana may sell up to $100.0 million of certain of its accounts receivable under a sales agreement, without recourse, which expires in May 2003. Northern Indiana plans to renew the agreement in May of 2003. Northern Indiana has sold $100.0 million under this agreement. Under this agreement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2003. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through NiSources Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2002 were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Long term debt $ 1,224.7 $ 142.6 $ 1,321.6 $ 193.8 $ 394.4 $ 2,918.8 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.2 Capital leases 7.9 57.6 7.3 7.8 7.9 89.9 Operating leases 56.3 51.1 47.6 45.0 43.6 173.9 Purchase obligations 144.3 202.0 156.4 119.3 107.2 596.7 Total contractual obligations $ 1,433.8 $ 454.2 $ 1,533.8 $ 366.8 $ 554.0 $ 3,779.5 NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2003. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2002 and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Lines of credit $ 150.0 $ 763.1 $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 52.9 4.9 1.2 117.0 Guarantees 1,642.6 131.9 1,042.2 1,077.8 76.9 2,154.7 Total commercial commitments $ 1,845.5 $ 899.9 $ 1,043.4 $ 1,077.8 $ 76.9 $ 2,271.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.8 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2002 and 2001 and an estimate for year 2003: (in millions) 2003E 2002 2001 Gas Distribution $ 195.6 $ 196.4 $ 211.3 Transmission & Storage 135.7 128.0 137.4 Electric 214.5 197.8 134.7 Exploration & Production 82.5 90.8 118.8 Other 19.5 5.9 77.0 Total $ 647.8 $ 618.9 $ 679.2 For 2002, capital expenditures were $618.9 million, a decrease of $60.3 million over 2001. The Gas Distribution segments capital program in 2002 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Transmission and Storage segment invested $128.0 million in 2002 primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Companies within the Other segment invested $5.9 million in energy technologies. For 2003, the projected capital program is expected to be $647.8 million, which is $28.9 million higher than the 2002 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for NOx compliance, a portion of which will be recovered through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Pension Funding Due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and a lower assumed discount rate, NiSources pension plans are currently in an underfunded position. Although NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term rate. Also, NiSource expects pension expense for 2003 to increase $42.8 million over the amount recognized in 2002. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Prior to the sale, TPCs operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility, marketing a portion of the gas produced from NiSources exploration and production operations, and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2002, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $913.1 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of Columbias long term debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new "receive fixed" and "pay floating" interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month LIBOR BBA plus 2.66% per annum. In total, Columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on $663.0 million of its long term debt. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2002 and 2001, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $17.5 million and $23.2 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. NiSources Primary Energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate, and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps expired June 30, 2002 and subsequently, upon lease termination at December 31, 2002, Primary Energy purchased the previously leased facilities. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Other Income (Deductions) in 2001 reduced income $615.7 million compared to a reduction in 2000 of $344.1 million. Interest expense, net increased $293.5 million over 2000 primarily due to the full year effect of interest on outstanding Columbia debt and the debt incurred for the acquisition, partly offset by a decrease in interest rates on short term borrowings. Minority interest, consisting of dividends paid on company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities was $20.4 million in both 2001 and 2000. Other, net increased income $10.2 million in 2001 and decreased income $11.4 million in 2000. The 2000 period included a charitable donation of facilities. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $43.1 million in 2002 as compared with 2001 and increased $64.5 million in 2001 over 2000 primarily as a result of higher pre tax income in each succeeding period. The effective income tax rates were 35.5 %, 45.7% and 47.1% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate in 2002 versus the previous year was due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in 2002. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of $53.2 million, or a loss of 25 cents per share, in 2002 compared to an after tax loss of $14.2 million, or loss of 7 cents per share, in 2001 and income of $9.0 million, or 7 cents per share, in 2000. The 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of $51.3 million, after tax, that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and NiSources decision to exit the telecommunications business. The loss in the 2001 period was primarily related to the results of Transcoms operations, including an impairment charge of $5.7 million, after tax. The 2000 period primarily reflects the operations of the water utilities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Generally, cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements. A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. In the summer months, cash receipts from electric sales normally exceed cash requirements. Also, during the summer months, cash on hand, together with external short term and long term financing, is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries, perform necessary maintenance of facilities, make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas. Net cash from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 was $1,172.4 million. Cash generated from working capital was $165.6 million, principally driven by reductions in inventories and gas receivables, partly offset by payments for current liabilities and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs. In February 2003, NiSource issued approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES. Concurrently with the settlement of the forward agreements, NiSource remarketed the underlying securities. NiSource received the net proceeds of the remarketing in satisfaction of the Corporate PIES holders obligation under the forward equity agreements. The purchaser of the remarketed securities purchased 6.15% notes due in 2013 using the debentures for consideration. On January 28, 2003, NiSource announced that its subsidiary CNR had sold its interest in a natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York State for $95 million to an undisclosed buyer. The proceeds were used to reduce short term debt. In November 2002, NiSource issued 41.4 million shares of common stock at a per share price of $18.30 ($17.75 on a net basis). The net proceeds of approximately $734.9 million were used to reduce debt. NiSource plans to redeem $75 million of Capital Markets, 7.75% Subordinated Debentures due March 1, 2026 by the end of the first quarter 2003. 15 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSource plans to refinance approximately $1.2 billion of expiring long term debt during 2003 with additional proceeds from asset sales and new debt issuances by its financing subsidiary NiSource Finance. Credit Facilities During March 2002, NiSource Finance negotiated a $500 million 364 day credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, led by Barclays Capital, which expires on March 20, 2003. This facility replaced the expiring $1.25 billion 364 day credit facility and complements NiSources existing $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004. NiSource will not renew the 364 day facility, which expires on March 20, 2003. In addition, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 is being amended to allow for the aggregate letters of credit outstanding under this agreement to be increased from $150 million to $400 million. The reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the sales IWCR, SM&P and the exploration and production joint venture, the proceeds from the November 2002 equity offering, and positive operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, $150.0 million and $1,004.3 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 2.25% and 3.14%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%, and credit facility advances of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource had $171.7 million and $51.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, $665.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Credit Ratings During January 2002, Standard and Poors reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On February 1, 2002, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3 with a negative outlook. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated NiSource subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to NiSources ratings going forward. On February 5, 2002, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its F2 commercial paper rating, but revised NiSources ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative." On November 27, 2002, NiSource completed an equity offering, realizing $734.9 million in net proceeds, which were used for the repayment of debt. The equity offering significantly improved NiSources financial position by reducing its debt leverage ratios. In addition, NiSource expects to further reduce leverage by using the proceeds from the recent sale of its natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York to reduce outstanding debt. While the rating agencies stated that they have welcomed NiSources recent actions to reduce financial leverage, additional balance sheet improvement measures may be necessary to either secure a ratings upgrade or to improve the current ratings outlook. TPC has entered into electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade to Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17.0 million to $34.0 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $270.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $270.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Ohio) is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, a majority of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below BB or Ba2, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2002, Columbia of Ohio has sold $99.5 million to the conduit. Northern Indiana may sell up to $100.0 million of certain of its accounts receivable under a sales agreement, without recourse, which expires in May 2003. Northern Indiana plans to renew the agreement in May of 2003. Northern Indiana has sold $100.0 million under this agreement. Under this agreement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2003. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through NiSources Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2002 were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Long term debt $ 1,224.7 $ 142.6 $ 1,321.6 $ 193.8 $ 394.4 $ 2,918.8 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.2 Capital leases 7.9 57.6 7.3 7.8 7.9 89.9 Operating leases 56.3 51.1 47.6 45.0 43.6 173.9 Purchase obligations 144.3 202.0 156.4 119.3 107.2 596.7 Total contractual obligations $ 1,433.8 $ 454.2 $ 1,533.8 $ 366.8 $ 554.0 $ 3,779.5 NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2003. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2002 and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Lines of credit $ 150.0 $ 763.1 $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 52.9 4.9 1.2 117.0 Guarantees 1,642.6 131.9 1,042.2 1,077.8 76.9 2,154.7 Total commercial commitments $ 1,845.5 $ 899.9 $ 1,043.4 $ 1,077.8 $ 76.9 $ 2,271.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.8 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2002 and 2001 and an estimate for year 2003: (in millions) 2003E 2002 2001 Gas Distribution $ 195.6 $ 196.4 $ 211.3 Transmission & Storage 135.7 128.0 137.4 Electric 214.5 197.8 134.7 Exploration & Production 82.5 90.8 118.8 Other 19.5 5.9 77.0 Total $ 647.8 $ 618.9 $ 679.2 For 2002, capital expenditures were $618.9 million, a decrease of $60.3 million over 2001. The Gas Distribution segments capital program in 2002 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Transmission and Storage segment invested $128.0 million in 2002 primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Companies within the Other segment invested $5.9 million in energy technologies. For 2003, the projected capital program is expected to be $647.8 million, which is $28.9 million higher than the 2002 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for NOx compliance, a portion of which will be recovered through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Pension Funding Due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and a lower assumed discount rate, NiSources pension plans are currently in an underfunded position. Although NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term rate. Also, NiSource expects pension expense for 2003 to increase $42.8 million over the amount recognized in 2002. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Prior to the sale, TPCs operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility, marketing a portion of the gas produced from NiSources exploration and production operations, and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2002, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $913.1 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of Columbias long term debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new "receive fixed" and "pay floating" interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month LIBOR BBA plus 2.66% per annum. In total, Columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on $663.0 million of its long term debt. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2002 and 2001, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $17.5 million and $23.2 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. NiSources Primary Energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate, and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps expired June 30, 2002 and subsequently, upon lease termination at December 31, 2002, Primary Energy purchased the previously leased facilities. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage. Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into five primary business segments; Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Exploration and Production, and Other. 23 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. NiSource plans to refinance approximately $1.2 billion of expiring long term debt during 2003 with additional proceeds from asset sales and new debt issuances by its financing subsidiary NiSource Finance. Credit Facilities During March 2002, NiSource Finance negotiated a $500 million 364 day credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, led by Barclays Capital, which expires on March 20, 2003. This facility replaced the expiring $1.25 billion 364 day credit facility and complements NiSources existing $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004. NiSource will not renew the 364 day facility, which expires on March 20, 2003. In addition, the $1.25 billion three year facility that expires on March 23, 2004 is being amended to allow for the aggregate letters of credit outstanding under this agreement to be increased from $150 million to $400 million. The reduction in NiSources short term borrowing needs is attributable to the sales IWCR, SM&P and the exploration and production joint venture, the proceeds from the November 2002 equity offering, and positive operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, $150.0 million and $1,004.3 million of commercial paper was outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 2.25% and 3.14%, respectively. In addition, NiSource had outstanding credit facility advances under its 3 year facility of $763.1 million at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.107%, and credit facility advances of $850.0 million at December 31, 2001, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.575%. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource had $171.7 million and $51.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, $665.2 million of credit was available under the credit facilities. Credit Ratings During January 2002, Standard and Poors reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its A2 commercial paper rating with a negative outlook. On February 1, 2002, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of NiSource and NiSource Finance to Baa3 and the commercial paper rating of NiSource Finance to P3 with a negative outlook. In addition, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated NiSource subsidiaries to Baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to NiSources ratings going forward. On February 5, 2002, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed NiSources BBB senior unsecured long term credit rating and its F2 commercial paper rating, but revised NiSources ratings outlook from "Stable" to "Negative." On November 27, 2002, NiSource completed an equity offering, realizing $734.9 million in net proceeds, which were used for the repayment of debt. The equity offering significantly improved NiSources financial position by reducing its debt leverage ratios. In addition, NiSource expects to further reduce leverage by using the proceeds from the recent sale of its natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York to reduce outstanding debt. While the rating agencies stated that they have welcomed NiSources recent actions to reduce financial leverage, additional balance sheet improvement measures may be necessary to either secure a ratings upgrade or to improve the current ratings outlook. TPC has entered into electric trading agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries fall below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa3 at Moodys. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions. The collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million. In the case of NiSources Primary Energy subsidiaries, ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects. One other Primary Energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade to Ba1 by Moodys or BB+ by Standard and Poors. The letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of $17.0 million to $34.0 million depending on the extent of the downgrade. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $270.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $270.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Ohio) is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, a majority of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below BB or Ba2, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2002, Columbia of Ohio has sold $99.5 million to the conduit. Northern Indiana may sell up to $100.0 million of certain of its accounts receivable under a sales agreement, without recourse, which expires in May 2003. Northern Indiana plans to renew the agreement in May of 2003. Northern Indiana has sold $100.0 million under this agreement. Under this agreement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2003. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through NiSources Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2002 were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Long term debt $ 1,224.7 $ 142.6 $ 1,321.6 $ 193.8 $ 394.4 $ 2,918.8 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.2 Capital leases 7.9 57.6 7.3 7.8 7.9 89.9 Operating leases 56.3 51.1 47.6 45.0 43.6 173.9 Purchase obligations 144.3 202.0 156.4 119.3 107.2 596.7 Total contractual obligations $ 1,433.8 $ 454.2 $ 1,533.8 $ 366.8 $ 554.0 $ 3,779.5 NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2003. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2002 and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Lines of credit $ 150.0 $ 763.1 $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 52.9 4.9 1.2 117.0 Guarantees 1,642.6 131.9 1,042.2 1,077.8 76.9 2,154.7 Total commercial commitments $ 1,845.5 $ 899.9 $ 1,043.4 $ 1,077.8 $ 76.9 $ 2,271.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.8 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2002 and 2001 and an estimate for year 2003: (in millions) 2003E 2002 2001 Gas Distribution $ 195.6 $ 196.4 $ 211.3 Transmission & Storage 135.7 128.0 137.4 Electric 214.5 197.8 134.7 Exploration & Production 82.5 90.8 118.8 Other 19.5 5.9 77.0 Total $ 647.8 $ 618.9 $ 679.2 For 2002, capital expenditures were $618.9 million, a decrease of $60.3 million over 2001. The Gas Distribution segments capital program in 2002 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Transmission and Storage segment invested $128.0 million in 2002 primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Companies within the Other segment invested $5.9 million in energy technologies. For 2003, the projected capital program is expected to be $647.8 million, which is $28.9 million higher than the 2002 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for NOx compliance, a portion of which will be recovered through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Pension Funding Due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and a lower assumed discount rate, NiSources pension plans are currently in an underfunded position. Although NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term rate. Also, NiSource expects pension expense for 2003 to increase $42.8 million over the amount recognized in 2002. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Prior to the sale, TPCs operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility, marketing a portion of the gas produced from NiSources exploration and production operations, and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2002, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $913.1 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of Columbias long term debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new "receive fixed" and "pay floating" interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month LIBOR BBA plus 2.66% per annum. In total, Columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on $663.0 million of its long term debt. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2002 and 2001, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $17.5 million and $23.2 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. NiSources Primary Energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate, and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps expired June 30, 2002 and subsequently, upon lease termination at December 31, 2002, Primary Energy purchased the previously leased facilities. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage. Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into five primary business segments; Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Exploration and Production, and Other. 23 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements. The surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with Mahonia II Limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately $270.0 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of Columbia falls below BBB at Standard and Poors or Baa2 at Moodys. Columbias long term debt ratings are currently BBB and Baa2 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately $270.0 million declining over time. In another, but unrelated transaction, the surety, in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement, required NiSource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately $131.0 million, declining over time, to support the bonds. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Ohio) is a party to an agreement to sell, without recourse, a majority of its trade receivables to Columbia Accounts Receivable Corporation (CARC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia. CARC, in turn, is party to an agreement in which it sells a percentage ownership interest in a defined pool of the accounts receivable to a commercial paper conduit. Under these agreements, CARC may not sell any new affiliate receivables to the conduit if Columbias debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. In addition, if Columbias debt rating falls below BB or Ba2, the agreements terminate and CARC may not sell any new receivables to the conduit. As of December 31, 2002, Columbia of Ohio has sold $99.5 million to the conduit. Northern Indiana may sell up to $100.0 million of certain of its accounts receivable under a sales agreement, without recourse, which expires in May 2003. Northern Indiana plans to renew the agreement in May of 2003. Northern Indiana has sold $100.0 million under this agreement. Under this agreement, Northern Indiana may not sell any new receivables if Northern Indianas debt rating falls below BBB or Baa3 at Standard and Poors and Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NiSource has certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond 2003. The obligations include long term debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, lease obligations, and purchase obligations for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services through NiSources Gas Distribution subsidiaries. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2002 were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Long term debt $ 1,224.7 $ 142.6 $ 1,321.6 $ 193.8 $ 394.4 $ 2,918.8 Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.2 Capital leases 7.9 57.6 7.3 7.8 7.9 89.9 Operating leases 56.3 51.1 47.6 45.0 43.6 173.9 Purchase obligations 144.3 202.0 156.4 119.3 107.2 596.7 Total contractual obligations $ 1,433.8 $ 454.2 $ 1,533.8 $ 366.8 $ 554.0 $ 3,779.5 NiSource has made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond 2003. The commitments include lines of credit, letters of credit and guarantees, which support commercial activities. The total commercial commitments in existence at December 31, 2002 and the years in which they expire were: (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Lines of credit $ 150.0 $ 763.1 $ $ $ $ Letters of credit 52.9 4.9 1.2 117.0 Guarantees 1,642.6 131.9 1,042.2 1,077.8 76.9 2,154.7 Total commercial commitments $ 1,845.5 $ 899.9 $ 1,043.4 $ 1,077.8 $ 76.9 $ 2,271.7 Of the commercial commitments outstanding shown above, NiSource had approximately $4.8 billion of debt and capital lease obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. 17 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2002 and 2001 and an estimate for year 2003: (in millions) 2003E 2002 2001 Gas Distribution $ 195.6 $ 196.4 $ 211.3 Transmission & Storage 135.7 128.0 137.4 Electric 214.5 197.8 134.7 Exploration & Production 82.5 90.8 118.8 Other 19.5 5.9 77.0 Total $ 647.8 $ 618.9 $ 679.2 For 2002, capital expenditures were $618.9 million, a decrease of $60.3 million over 2001. The Gas Distribution segments capital program in 2002 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Transmission and Storage segment invested $128.0 million in 2002 primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Companies within the Other segment invested $5.9 million in energy technologies. For 2003, the projected capital program is expected to be $647.8 million, which is $28.9 million higher than the 2002 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for NOx compliance, a portion of which will be recovered through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Pension Funding Due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and a lower assumed discount rate, NiSources pension plans are currently in an underfunded position. Although NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term rate. Also, NiSource expects pension expense for 2003 to increase $42.8 million over the amount recognized in 2002. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Prior to the sale, TPCs operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility, marketing a portion of the gas produced from NiSources exploration and production operations, and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2002, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $913.1 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of Columbias long term debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new "receive fixed" and "pay floating" interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month LIBOR BBA plus 2.66% per annum. In total, Columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on $663.0 million of its long term debt. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2002 and 2001, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $17.5 million and $23.2 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. NiSources Primary Energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate, and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps expired June 30, 2002 and subsequently, upon lease termination at December 31, 2002, Primary Energy purchased the previously leased facilities. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Capital Expenditures The table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for 2002 and 2001 and an estimate for year 2003: (in millions) 2003E 2002 2001 Gas Distribution $ 195.6 $ 196.4 $ 211.3 Transmission & Storage 135.7 128.0 137.4 Electric 214.5 197.8 134.7 Exploration & Production 82.5 90.8 118.8 Other 19.5 5.9 77.0 Total $ 647.8 $ 618.9 $ 679.2 For 2002, capital expenditures were $618.9 million, a decrease of $60.3 million over 2001. The Gas Distribution segments capital program in 2002 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers, as well as expenditures to ensure safe, reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities. The Transmission and Storage segment invested $128.0 million in 2002 primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing, new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities, either wholly owned by NiSource or in partnership with other qualified project participants. The Electric capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction, and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Companies within the Other segment invested $5.9 million in energy technologies. For 2003, the projected capital program is expected to be $647.8 million, which is $28.9 million higher than the 2002 level. This higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for NOx compliance, a portion of which will be recovered through the Northern Indiana environmental tracker. The program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations. Pension Funding Due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and a lower assumed discount rate, NiSources pension plans are currently in an underfunded position. Although NiSource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods, NiSource may be required to provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 9.0% long term rate. Also, NiSource expects pension expense for 2003 to increase $42.8 million over the amount recognized in 2002. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POSITIONS Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses and activities. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 18 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Prior to the sale, TPCs operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility, marketing a portion of the gas produced from NiSources exploration and production operations, and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2002, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $913.1 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of Columbias long term debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new "receive fixed" and "pay floating" interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month LIBOR BBA plus 2.66% per annum. In total, Columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on $663.0 million of its long term debt. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2002 and 2001, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $17.5 million and $23.2 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. NiSources Primary Energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate, and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps expired June 30, 2002 and subsequently, upon lease termination at December 31, 2002, Primary Energy purchased the previously leased facilities. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage. Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into five primary business segments; Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Exploration and Production, and Other. 23 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Through its various business activities, NiSource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks. The non trading risks to which NiSource is exposed include interest rate risk, commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries. The risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks. NiSources risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk, including futures, forwards, options and swaps. Risk management at NiSource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives. NiSource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks, including value at risk (VaR) and instrument sensitivity to market factors. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. Non Trading Risks Commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process. As the utility industry undergoes deregulation, these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk. Effective July 1, 2002, TPC sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio, physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party. Prior to the sale, TPCs operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses. Beginning with the effective date of the sale, the primary remaining operations associated with TPC include commercial and industrial gas sales (including arranging supply), power marketing and gas supply associated with NiSources single merchant cogeneration facility, marketing a portion of the gas produced from NiSources exploration and production operations, and power trading. With the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, since July 1, 2002 the gas related activities at TPC are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes. NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates, and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets. At December 31, 2002, the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled $913.1 million. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of Columbias long term debt. On September 3, 2002, Columbia entered into new "receive fixed" and "pay floating" interest rate swap agreements totaling $281.5 million with three counterparties effective as of September 5, 2002. According to the agreements, NiSource will receive payments based upon a fixed 7.32% interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month LIBOR BBA plus 2.66% per annum. In total, Columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on $663.0 million of its long term debt. Based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during 2002 and 2001, an increase in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased interest expense by $17.5 million and $23.2 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. NiSources Primary Energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate, and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges. The swaps expired June 30, 2002 and subsequently, upon lease termination at December 31, 2002, Primary Energy purchased the previously leased facilities. Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is a factor in many of NiSources business activities. Credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay NiSource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure. Current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes, such as commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees. Because many of NiSources exposures vary with changes in market prices, NiSource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices. In determining exposure, NiSource considers collateral and master netting agreements, which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk. 19 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Trading Risks Prior to the July 1, 2002 sale of the TPC gas marketing and trading contracts, NiSources trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities. Beginning July 1, with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal, which expired in October 2002, the trading activities of TPC have involved power only. The transactions associated with NiSources power trading operations give rise to various risks, including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity. The power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards. Fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction. Fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity. The current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers, or financial models such as the Black Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of the contracts related to NiSources trading operations, the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during 2002, the sources of the valuations of the contracts during 2002 and the years in which the remaining contracts (all power trading) mature are: (in millions) 2002 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 8.9 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (including net option premiums received) (29.1) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period 10.2 Other changes in fair values during the period 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (in millions) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After Prices actively quoted $ $ $ $ $ $ Prices from other external sources 0.2 Prices based on models/other method (0.2) Total fair values $ (0.0) $ $ $ $ $ Contracts reported within the caption "Prices actively quoted" include futures and options traded on the NYMEX. The caption "Prices from other external sources" generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information. Contracts shown within "Prices based on models/other method" are valued employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource estimates the one day VaR across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance/covariance at a 95% confidence level. Based on the results of the VaR analysis, the daily market exposure for power trading on an average, high and low basis was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and effectively zero, during 2002, respectively. The daily VaR for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average, high and low basis was $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million during 2002, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limits at $0.5 million for gas related activities and $2.5 million for power trading. Exceeding the VaR limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage. Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into five primary business segments; Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Exploration and Production, and Other. 23 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001, NiSource adopted the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (a) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or (b) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately $4.0 million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of approximately $17.0 million, which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001. The adoption also resulted in the recognition of $178.0 million of assets and $212.8 million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of $3.8 million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to OCI of $17.9 million. Equity Forward Share Purchase Agreement In 1999, NiSource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes. The terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the Corporate PIES. As the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares, NiSource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date. NiSource terminated the agreement at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001. Due to the termination, NiSource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of $4.4 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of December 31, 2000. During the first quarter of 2001, through the settlement date, NiSource recognized $2.1 million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies" of this Item 7, and "Risk Management Activities" in Notes 2 and 8, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. OTHER INFORMATION Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and consolidated balance sheets. SFAS NO. 71 ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF REGULATION. SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $906.6 million and $109.3 million at December 31, 2002, and $826.8 million and $158.2 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71, NiSource would be required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71." In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to SFAS No. 71 for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $157.3 million at December 31, 2002. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. 21 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage. Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into five primary business segments; Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Exploration and Production, and Other. 23 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions." 44 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. HEDGING ACTIVITIES. Under SFAS No. 133, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $167.1 million of price risk management assets and $31.7 million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was $67.8 million at December 31, 2002. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES. Energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices. NiSource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under SFAS No. 133. Through 2002, contracts not meeting the criteria under SFAS No. 133 were recorded at fair value under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF No. 98 10). Pursuant to EITF No. 98 10, when certain trading criteria are met, energy contracts, including "energy related contracts" such as tolling, transportation and storage contracts, should be accounted for at fair value (marked to market) along with any related derivative contracts, recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings. During an October 25, 2002 EITF meeting, EITF No. 98 10 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after December 31, 2002 for existing trading contracts. While the assessment of fair values for NiSources trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts, transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models. No estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of December 31, 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year. In addition, power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used Black Scholes option pricing model. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the "mark to fair value" options outstanding was a loss of $0.2 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NiSource reflected $16.4 million and $252.3 million of price risk management assets and $16.4 million and $243.4 million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities, respectively. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The plans are accounted for under SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, amongst other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Union Strike Settlement In September 2002, employee members of the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union Locals 5 0372 and 5 0628 ratified a five year contract from Columbia Transmission, CNR and Columbia Gas of Kentucky. Employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work September 24, 2002 after a work stoppage that began August 28, 2002. The strike did not have a material impact on NiSources results of operations. 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Insurance Renewal NiSource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44%, with additional increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to coverage and capacity, for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001 to 2002. Indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue in the foreseeable future. This upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years, in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy, which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage. Presentation of Segment Information NiSources operations are divided into five primary business segments; Gas Distribution, Gas Transmission and Storage, Electric, Exploration and Production, and Other. 23 ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility.

Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Competition Gas Distribution competes with investor owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area, and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers. Gas Distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the New England markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market. Restructuring During 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. Gas Distribution accrued approximately $7.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. The charge included $2.4 million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in Richmond, Virginia and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was decreased by $0.7 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters Changes in gas industry regulation, which began in the mid 1980s at the federal level, has broadened to retail customers at the state level. Large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use Gas Distributions facilities for transportation services for many years. This opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served by Gas Distribution. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 0.7 million of Gas Distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier. Gas Distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions. While these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants, Gas Distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future. As customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers, the Gas Distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for, but no longer need. The state commissions in jurisdictions served by Gas Distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations. Gas Distribution is currently recovering, or has the opportunity to recover, the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered. Methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms, reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers. In December 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a request from Columbia Gas of Ohio that extends Columbia of Ohios Customer CHOICE(SM) program through October 31, 2004, freezes base rates through October 31, 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity. Under the agreement, Columbia of Ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers. Columbia of Ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs. On November 20, 2001, the PUCO issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the Ohio General Assembly on March 27, 2001. The rules have been approved by a Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review of the Ohio Legislature, and were effective on July 5, 2002. The new rules establish the process for PUCO certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers, establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers, and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs, in which consumers have the right to "opt out" of the program. Columbia of Ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on November 1, 2002. A number of communities in the service territory of Columbia of Ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections. There are approximately 0.2 million eligible customers 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) in these communities. Two communities began governmental aggregation in late 2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in 2003. As part of the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) order approving the acquisition of Columbia, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc. (Columbia Gas of Kentucky) was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills. On May 1, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky filed a general rate case, requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $2.5 million or 4% of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings. On September 30, 2002, Columbia Gas of Kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the KPSC. The settlement was approved by the KPSC on December 13, 2002. The settlement reduces Columbia Gas of Kentuckys base rates by $7.8 million, with $0.5 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers. The changes become effective in March 2003. In November 2001, Northern Utilities New Hampshire (NUNH) filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately $3.8 million or 7% of annual operating revenues. In February 2002, NUNH received approval of interim rates, designed to generate an additional $2.3 million in revenues annually, to be applied to gas consumed on and after February 7, 2002. In September 2002, NUNH and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) that will increase rates by approximately $1.1 million. On October 28, the NHPUC issued an order approving the settlement, with new permanent rates effective as of November 1, 2002. NUNH will refund to customers approximately $0.5 million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase, generated from temporary rates, (reduced by the approved rate case expenses) and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from February 7 to November 1. The net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12 month period from November 2002 through October 2003. On August 11, 1999, the IURC approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for Northern Indiana. Under the new procedure, the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined, after hearings and IURC approval, and made effective on November 1 of each year. The demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the IURC. The commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings, which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month, subject to refund. The monthly filings do not require IURC approval but will be reviewed by the IURC during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing. Northern Indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price. Northern Indiana made its annual filing on August 29, 2002. The IURC approved implementation of interim rates, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2002. Another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered. A hearing is scheduled for March 13, 2003. Management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs. FERC Order 637 The FERC issued Order 637 on February 9, 2000. The order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market. It effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures, pipeline penalties, pricing transparency, new pipeline service offerings, capacity release capabilities, new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry. Since the order was issued, pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply. Gas Distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues. To date, only a few of Gas Distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement FERC approved settlements. Most of the major pipeline suppliers to Gas Distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings, which have been approved by FERC, but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing. Also, as a result of a legal challenge to Order No. 637, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to FERC some aspects of Order No. 637, but did not upset Order No. 637 generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule. 26 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Based upon orders from FERC on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by FERC, Gas Distribution believes that full implementation of Order 637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003 2004. Additionally, based upon Gas Distributions experience to date and FERCs guidance regarding the effect of Order No. 637 on various aspects of pipeline operations, as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry, management believes that while full implementation of Order No. 637 will result in some additional competition for Gas Distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have "supplier of last resort" obligations, it will not have a material effect upon Gas Distribution costs, operations, or income. Environmental Matters REMEDIATION. Several Gas Distribution subsidiaries are "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws, including at former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites which such subsidiaries, or their corporate predecessors, own or previously owned or operated. Gas Distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites. In addition, some Gas Distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the Toxic Substances Control Act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities. Gas Distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under Superfund or similar state laws. For one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and, for the other two, the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted, as necessary. A program has been instituted to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner. The program has identified 84 such sites. Initial investigation has been conducted at 40 sites. Of these sites, additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 21 sites. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" (SFAS No. 5). As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. As reserves are recorded, regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. NiSource is unable, at this time, to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program. Management expects that, as characterization is completed, additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available, NiSource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the Security Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 92 (SAB No. 92) which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies, SFAS No. 5, and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities" (SOP No. 96 1). As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $65.9 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership or operation, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required, after consideration of insurance coverage, contributions from other PRPs and rate recovery, will not have a material effect on its financial position. Market Conditions In the winter of 2000 2001, U.S. wellhead gas prices peaked at over $8.00 per dekatherm (Dth). The unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period. Demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000, proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during November and December 2000. Lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the 2000 2001 winter heating season. 27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas.

Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand. Reduced industrial production and fuel switching (to coal, heating oil and distillate) resulted in industrial throughput falling 25% from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet (Bcf). The steel industry, which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in Indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy. Responding to higher natural gas prices, producers increased drilling activity, recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001. The increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies. These factors coupled with a near record warm 2001 2002 winter heating season resulted in prices for the 2001 2002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s. As natural gas prices in 2001 began declining, producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation. This reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of 2002. Responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities, natural gas prices began to increase in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year. Spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the NYMEX, are in the $4.00 $6.00/Dth range, significantly higher than the prices experienced during the 2001 2002 winter season. Entering this winter, storage levels were near the top of the five year range; however, concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices. Mid way through the 2002 2003 winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average. Given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production, natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season. To date, the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling. Recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year 2002 at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during 2001. All NiSource Gas Distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory, the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the Gas Distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges. The treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under "Regulatory Matters." Capital Expenditures The Gas Distribution segments net capital expenditure program was $196.4 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $195.6 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $81.5 million in 2002 and are expected to be $77.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Weather Weather in the Gas Distribution service territories for 2002 was 7% warmer than normal and 6% colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately $21.8 million over 2001. 28 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) In 2001, weather in the Gas Distribution service territories was 13% warmer than normal. This negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial customers by approximately 36.0 million dekatherms (MDth) versus 2000 and reduced net revenues by approximately $63.0 million. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported of 923.8 MDth for 2002 decreased 83.0 MDth from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in off system sales. For 2001, total volumes sold and transported of 1,006.8 MDth increased 467.4 MDth from 2000. The acquisition of Columbia contributed 550.8 MDth of additional throughput. This increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic decline on industrial demand, primarily from the steel industry. Additionally, the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 35.7 MDth. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2002 were $1,388.8 million, down $3.6 million from 2001 mainly as a result of a decrease in off system sales and incentive programs amounting to $24.3 million, mostly offset by $21.8 million as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001. Net revenues for 2001 were $1,392.4 million, up $656.4 million over 2000. The acquisition of Columbia generated higher net revenues of $662.8 million, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $459.1 million, an increase of $78.3 million over the same period in 2001. The increase was a result of favorable weather of $21.8 million and $81.9 million from lower operating expenses, mainly resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of $42.8 million, $24.5 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses, decreased employee related and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of $19.3 million and reductions of $9.2 million in reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses. The favorable variances were partially offset by a decrease of $24.3 million in off system sales and incentive programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, operating income for the Gas Distribution operations was $380.8 million, an increase of $139.8 million over the same period in 2000, reflecting the benefit of twelve months of Columbia operations compared to two months in 2000. The increase was tempered by record setting, warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by approximately $63.0 million, a $36.0 million increase in amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Columbia and $23.4 million for restructuring costs. In addition, uncollectibles increased $13.1 million over the prior year, primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the 2000 2001 winter heating period. The negative variance was reduced by the impact of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling approximately $19.5 million. 29 ITEM 7.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility.

Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

The 442 mile pipeline will connect to Canadian facilities at a new Lake Erie export point and transport approximately 700 MDth per day to eastern markets. In August 2001, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. and St. Clair Pipelines, Ltd., the sponsors of the proposed upstream Canadian facilities to the Lake Erie export point, withdrew their pending applications before Canadas National Energy Board for approval of the proposed facilities, without prejudice to refiling at a later date. The withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in Millenniums FERC proceedings. On December 19, 2001, the FERC issued a certificate approving the construction and operation of the pipeline, subject to a number of conditions, including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary Canadian authorizations were obtained. Rehearing requests were filed on January 18, 2002. On September 19, 2002, the FERC issued its order granting final certificate authority for the project. The order largely supports the finding of the December 19, 2001 certificate order and holds that the FERC adequately complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act in approving the project. The order specifies that Millennium may not begin construction until the required approvals from Canadas National Energy Board and other agencies are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met. One such condition is compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered by the State of New Yorks Department of State (NYDOS). NYDOS has determined that the project is not consistent with the Act, and Millennium has appealed that decision to the United States Department of Commerce. To date, a number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available capacity. Millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the extent and timing of their needs. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The sponsors of the proposed Millennium project are Columbia Transmission, Westcoast Energy, Inc. (subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp.), TransCanada Pipe Lines Ltd. and MCN Energy Group, Inc. (subsidiary of DTE Energy Co.). Transportation for New Electric Generation Projects Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to construct facilities to provide service at levels up to 560 MDth per day to three electric generating facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003. Due to market conditions, customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to terminate underlying contracts for service, and plans for these facilities have been terminated. However, Columbias plans to serve a 1,020 megawatt generating facility in Maryland with up to 270 MDth per day are progressing, and service is anticipated to begin in 2003. Pipeline Firm Service Contracts Since implementation of Order 636 in the early 1990s, the services of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf have consisted of open access transportation services, and open access storage services in the case of Columbia Transmission. These services are provided primarily to LDCs, and compete to some degree with comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines. The majority of the firm contracts that were restructured in Order 636 expire in late 2004. Customer decisions on capacity re subscription are affected by many factors, including decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements in the context of LDC unbundling proceedings. The companies have commenced the process for negotiating for re subscription of the firm capacity. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Gas Transmission and Storage accrued approximately $14.8 million of salaries, benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative. Environmental Matters Columbia Transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrative Order by Consent (AOC). The program pursuant to the AOC covers approximately 240 facilities, approximately 13,000 liquid removal points, approximately 2,200 mercury measurement stations and about 3,700 storage well locations. Field characterization had been performed at all sites. Site characterization reports and remediation plans, which must be submitted to the EPA for approval, are in various stages of development and completion. Remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations, liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240 facilities. Only those site investigation, characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, the associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. During 2002, Columbia Transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program. As a result, the liability was reduced by $15.5 million. The estimate may be adjusted as additional work is completed consistent with SAB No. 92, SFAS No. 5, and SOP No. 96 1. Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf are PRPs at several waste disposal sites. The potential liability is believed to be de minimis, however, the final allocation of clean up costs has yet to be determined. As site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. At December 31, 2002, the remaining environmental liability recorded on the balance sheet of Gas Transmission was $61.3 million. Future expenditures will be charged against the previously recorded liability. A regulatory asset has been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates. Management does not believe that Columbia Transmissions environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on NiSources operations, liquidity or financial position, based on known facts, existing laws, regulations, Columbia Transmissions cost recovery settlement with customers and the time period over which expenditures will be made. 31 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Lost and Unaccounted For Gas On March 28, 2002, the FERC issued an order affirming its earlier holdings rejecting challenges to Columbia Transmissions ability to recover certain lost and unaccounted for gas in its annual Retainage Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) filing. In addition, the FERC had previously directed Columbia Transmission to file information requested by interveners in its last annual RAM proceeding. Columbia Transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on March 1, 2002. On September 10, 2002, the FERC issued an order accepting the information filed by Columbia Transmission. This order effectively closed Columbia Transmissions 2001 and 2000 RAM proceedings. Storage Base Gas Sales Base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory. As a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations, Columbia Transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain deliverability. Columbia Transmission sold 2.0 MDth and 5.4 MDth of storage base gas volumes during 2002 and 2001, respectively. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of $2.9 million and $11.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Long Term Notes Receivable In 1999, Columbia Transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third party for approximately $22 million. The buyer executed a promissory note, which provides for payment of the purchase price to Columbia Transmission over a five year period. In the second quarter of 2002, an appropriate reserve was recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely payments from the counterparty. During the third quarter, management was able to negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys parent company as security for the note. At December 31, 2002, the balance of the note was $8.8 million. Capital Expenditure Program The Gas Transmission and Storage segments net capital expenditure program was $128.0 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $135.7 million in 2003. New business initiatives totaled approximately $27.0 million in 2002 and are expected to be $30.3 million in 2003. The remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities. Throughput Columbia Transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects mainline transportation services from Rayne, Louisiana to Leach, Kentucky and short haul transportation services from the Gulf of Mexico to Rayne, Louisiana. Crossroads serves customers in northern Indiana and Ohio and Granite State provides service in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,314.3 MDth for 2002, compared to 1,241.3 MDth in 2001. The increase of 73.0 MDth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage segment totaled 1,241.3 MDth for 2001, compared to 395.4 MDth in 2000. The increase of 845.9 MDth primarily reflected the addition of Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf as a result of the acquisition of Columbia. Net Revenues Net revenues were $874.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.2 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods. Net revenues were $883.6 million for 2001, an increase of $714.5 million from 2000 due to the inclusion of Columbias operations for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000. Also contributing to the increase was a gain of $11.4 million from the sale of base gas. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Operating Income Operating income of $398.3 million in 2002 increased $49.3 million from 2001. The increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization of $50.3 million of goodwill, a $10.0 million reduction in reserves for estimated environmental expenditures and lower employee related and support services expenses approximating $13.6 million. The favorable impacts were partly offset by $8.5 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to NiSources reorganization initiatives totaling $14.8 million. Operating income of $349.0 million in 2001 increased $303.3 million from 2000. This increase was due primarily to the inclusion of Columbias operations for twelve months, partially offset by an increase of $42.2 million for the amortization of goodwill related to the Columbia acquisition. In addition, the 2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of $11.4 million on the sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000. 33 ITEM 7.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

These changes will continue to have an impact on Electric Operations structure and profitability. At the same time, competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues. Management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission interconnections with neighboring electric utilities. 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) The economic situation in the steel and steel related industries continues to have an impact on electric sales. The Indiana facilities of LTV Corporation (LTV), which declared bankruptcy, were acquired by International Steel Group (ISG) in early 2002. Production levels at the ISG plant have gradually increased during 2002 but were down overall for the year, resulting in decreased sales. Although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal, overall sales to the steel industry increased 67.3 gigawatt hours (gwh) during the 2002 period as compared with 2001. Restructuring During the third quarter of 2002, NiSource carried out a new reorganization initiative, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all NiSource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees. During 2002, Electric Operations accrued approximately $2.5 million of salaries and benefits associated with the reorganization initiative. Additionally, during 2002, the restructuring accrual was reduced by $3.5 million related to previous reorganization initiatives. Regulatory Matters On June 20, 2002, a settlement agreement was filed with the IURC regarding the Northern Indiana electric rate review. On September 23, 2002, the IURC issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement. The order provides that electric customers of Northern Indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate $55.0 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months, beginning on July 1, 2002. The order also provides that 60% of any future earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by Northern Indiana. Pursuant to the IURC order, Northern Indiana, as authorized, began to amortize one half of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49 month period. The remaining expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002. On October 23, 2002, the IURC denied a petition for reconsideration of the settlement order filed on October 15, 2002 by fourteen residential customers. Therefore, Northern Indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting with their November monthly bill. The November bill included credits for the customers consumption beginning on July 1, 2002. Credits amounting to $28.1 million were recognized for electric customers for 2002. In addition, the order required Northern Indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review. The escrow account was established and fully funded with $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. The order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals by both the Citizen Action Coalition of Indiana and the fourteen residential customers. Northern Indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2002, which requires a sharing of earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the IURC order regarding the electric rate review settlement. The IURC issued an order related to the filing on January 29, 2002 taking exception to Northern Indianas proposed sharing calculation. The proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect during the twelve month period. Northern Indiana has filed with the IURC, a request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding. Northern Indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is appropriate. Regardless of the outcome, the settlement of this issue will not have a material impact on NiSources financial position or results of operations. In 1999, the FERC issued Order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of RTOs. On February 28, 2001, Northern Indiana joined the Alliance RTO. On December 18, 2001, the IURC issued an order denying Northern Indianas request to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the Alliance RTO. On December 20, 2001, the FERC reversed prior orders that had preliminarily approved the Alliance RTO and concluded that the Alliance RTO failed to meet Order 2000s scope and configuration requirements. FERC ordered the Alliance RTO companies, including Northern Indiana, to pursue membership in the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana, Ameren Corporation and First Energy Corporation established terms for joining the MISO through participation in an independent transmission company. The MISO arrangements were filed with the FERC, and on July 31, 2002, the FERC issued an order conditionally approving these arrangements. On November 5, 2002, the independent transmission company (ITC), which includes Northern Indiana, signed an agreement with MISO. Northern Indiana has expended approximately $8.2 million related to joining an RTO. NiSource believes that the amounts spent will be reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the ITC agreement and FERC approval. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Northern Indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for sale to its customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. The Fuel Adjustment Clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set based upon the costs of Northern Indianas most expensive generating unit. If costs exceed this cap, Northern Indiana must demonstrate that the costs were prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker (PPT). The PPT would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by Northern Indianas customers on a periodic basis. No actions have been taken by the IURC on this filing. In January 2002, Northern Indiana filed for approval to implement an environmental cost tracker (ECT). On June 20, 2002, Northern Indiana and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor filed an ECT Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (ECT Settlement Agreement), which resolved all issues in the proceeding. Under the ECT Settlement Agreement, Northern Indiana will be able to recover (1) allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the capital investment expended by Northern Indiana to implement Indiana Department of Environmental Managements nitrogen oxide State Implementation Plan and (2) related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational. The IURC approved the settlement on November 26, 2002. Northern Indiana made its initial filing for the ECT in February 2003. In 1995 Northern Indiana filed an Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) in FERC Docket No. ER96 399 with FERC as required in FERC Order No. 888. The OATT established, subject to refund, rates that Northern Indiana could charge all of its customers for transmission of electric power across Northern Indianas electric transmission facilities. The FERC established an administrative proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates. Although the proceeding continued to litigation with regard to certain customers, Northern Indiana reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer, Wabash Valley Power Association (WVPA), which established rates to be charged to WVPA and eliminated any refund liability on behalf of Northern Indiana for transmission service provided to WVPA. In the remaining portion of the proceeding, on December 30, 2002, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, reduced the rate base and rate of return allowed to Northern Indiana regarding its OATT, thus creating a refund liability for Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana did not seek rehearing of the FERCs December 30, 2002 order. Thus under FERC procedures, Northern Indiana is required to submit a compliance filing, currently due by March 17, 2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the FERCs order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to Northern Indiana as a result of the proceeding. Northern Indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the FERC Opinion. Environmental Matters AIR. In December 2001, the EPA approved regulations developed by the State of Indiana to comply with EPAs NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) call. The NOx SIP call requires certain states, including Indiana, to reduce NOx levels from several sources, including industrial and utility boilers, to lower regional transport of ozone. The NOx emission limitations in the Indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) acid rain NOx reduction program. Compliance with the NOx limits contained in these rules is required by May 31, 2004. Northern Indiana plans to install Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from $200 to $250 million. Actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand/resource constraints, uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs, and the potential need for additional control technology. The EPA issued final rules revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter in July 1997. These rules were widely challenged. On March 26, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged. Consequently, designation of areas not attaining the standards, promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level, compliance deadline, and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years, which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements. Resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and NOx emissions from coal fired boilers (including Northern Indianas electric generating stations). The EPA and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements. NiSource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the EPA, and are currently not reasonably estimable. NiSource will continue to closely 36 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) monitor developments in this area. However, the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time. During 1999, the EPA initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the CAAA and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities. Northern Indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the EPA on this subject over the last two years, most recently in June 2002. At this time, NiSource is unable to predict the result of EPAs review of Northern Indianas information responses. In November 2002, EPA announced reforms to the New Source Review rules that include two components. The first, a final rule, does not appear to significantly impact Northern Indiana. However, upon official publication of the rules by EPA on December 31, 2002, nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for District of Columbia. The second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization; therefore, Northern Indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations. Northern Indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts. Initiatives are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce so called "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, a by product of burning fossil fuels. Reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for Northern Indiana. The CAAA also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants. In response to the CAAA requirements, on December 20, 2000, the EPA issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate. The EPA expects to issue proposed regulations by December 15, 2003, and finalized regulations by December 15, 2004. The potential impact, if any, to NiSources financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time. The EPA is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze. The new Bush administration announced that the EPA would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to install the "best available retrofit technology" (BART). The BART program will target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility, namely particulate, sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides. Until the program is developed, Northern Indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules. WATER. The Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative (GLI) program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes watershed, including Northern Indianas three electric generating stations located on Lake Michigan. The State of Indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final EPA approval. As promulgated, the regulations would provide the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water. However, the EPA revised the variance language and other minor provisions of IDEMs GLI rule. The EPA by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact; however, a separate agreement between the EPA and IDEM on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact. The EPA change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with EPA/IDEM. Northern Indiana expects that IDEM will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations. Pending issuance of these permits, the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time. REMEDIATION. Northern Indiana is a PRP at three waste disposal sites under CERCLA and similar state laws, and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other PRPs. At one site, the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing. At another site, investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined. At the third site, Northern Indiana has recently entered into an EPA Administrative Order on Consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party, state permitted landfill where Northern Indiana contracted for fly ash disposal. EPA and IDEM are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site. 37 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002.

On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. ELECTRIC OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) As investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites, and as additional information becomes available, waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted. In addition, Northern Indiana has corrective action liability under the RCRA for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment, storage and disposal sites. As of December 31, 2002, a reserve of approximately $1.2 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors, including the volume of material contributed to the site, years of ownership of operations, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required. Based upon investigations and managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations, NiSource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations. Capital Expenditure Program The Electric segments net capital expenditure program was $197.8 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately $214.5 million in 2003. Expenditures for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation, transmission and distribution assets, expenditures related to environmental compliance (NOx reduction), and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business. Estimated expenditures for 2003 are approximately $100.0 million for the NOx compliance program. The remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs. Sales Electric sales for 2002 of 18,775.9 gwh increased 2,464.6 gwh compared to 2001 due to 27% warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Electric sales for 2001 of 16,311.3 gwh decreased 1,181.6 gwh compared to 2000, due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and steel industry bankruptcies, as well as reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather. Net Revenues Electric net revenues were $768.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $18.5 million from 2001, primarily as a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling net revenues. The unfavorable variance was partially offset by $14.8 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as compared to 2001. Electric net revenues for 2001 of $786.9 million decreased by $11.2 million from 2000, primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and reduced wholesale revenues, partially offset by warmer weather. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $322.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of $28.1 million in credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and $5.2 million from decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues, partially offset by $14.8 million from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season. Operating income for 2001 was $340.7 million, a decrease of $12.3 million from 2000. The decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses of $1.1 million. The 2001 operating expenses included increased uncollectible expenses of $2.4 million, restructuring charges of $5.2 million, and increased depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by decreased employee related costs and reduced electric production operating expenses. 38 ITEM 7.

NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7.

The assets of CNRs interest in the joint venture were reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. NiSource continues to seek opportunities to monetize the remaining exploration and production operations. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS (continued) Forward Sale of Natural Gas CNR has forward gas sales agreements with Mahonia II Limited (Mahonia). During 2002, CNR delivered 27.1 Bcf to Mahonia. Under the agreements, CNR has made the required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to deliver 116.1 Bcf of natural gas to Mahonia through February 2006. Cash received in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural gas. Deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales prices: 2003 2004 After Total Volumes to be delivered (Bcf) 44.0 41.5 30.6 116.1 Average sales price (per Mcf) $ 2.56 $ 2.56 $ 2.26 $ 2.48 Volumes Gas production was 54.2 Bcf in 2002, remaining flat as compared with the prior year. Oil and liquids production was 206,400 barrels in 2002 and 224,300 barrels in 2001. Gas production was 54.1 Bcf in 2001 and 9.5 Bcf in the last two months of 2000. Oil and liquids production was 224,300 barrels in 2001 and 26,500 barrels in the last two months of 2000. The production statistics for 2001 include a full year of production. Operating Revenues Operating revenues for the year of 2002 were $206.7 million, a decrease of $26.0 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements. Operating revenues for 2001 were $232.7 million, an increase of $192.1 million over 2000, primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared to two months in 2000. Operating Income Operating income for 2002 was $41.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million over 2001, primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of $17.8 million. Operating income for 2001 was $51.9 million, an increase of $46.5 million over 2000, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001 period compared to two months in 2000. 40 ITEM 7.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases.

On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business. Operating Income (Loss) The Other segment reported an operating loss of $34.3 million, an improvement of $19.5 million compared to the 2001 period. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to NiSources other non core subsidiaries, a $15.5 million litigation settlement related to MHP affecting the 2001 period, a $11.4 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business, consolidation of facilities of $11.3 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a $3.1 million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations. The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

SM&P operates an underground line locating and marking service in ten midwestern states. In the first quarter of 2002, NiSource recognized an after tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale. The gain on the sale was reflected in Corporate. Primary Energy PROJECT STATUS. Primary Energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity, steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers. Five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers. The energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees. One project, Whiting Clean Energy, uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use. In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility. Two projects (Ironside and North Lake) are owned by subsidiaries of Primary Energy, while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by Primary Energy subsidiaries. Primary Energys Whiting Clean Energy project at BPs Whiting, Indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in September 2001. The delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs. In addition, the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to BP to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications. Whiting Clean Energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications. The engineering, procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation. Whiting Clean Energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process, as prescribed under their contract, relating to these claims. However on December 31, 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract. The complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied. Primary Energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated. The Whiting project was placed into service in 2002. Primary Energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity. For 2002, the after tax loss was $20.9 million. For 2003, the after tax loss is projected to be approximately $27.6 million. The profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on, among other things, prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns. 41 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) Primary Energys Ironside project at LTVs East Chicago, Indiana mill was negatively impacted during 2002 by LTVs decision in December 2001 to idle the mill. On April 12, 2002, LTV completed the sale of the mill to ISG, which re started operations during the second and third quarters. On September 27, 2002, Ironside and ISG entered into a letter of intent for a 15 year agreement for Ironside to lease the facility to ISG. On September 10, 2002, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of the project for $65.9 million from the special purpose entity that financed the project. On October 31, 2002 Ironside and ISG entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the facility and payment of fees going forward. Full production is expected early in 2003. The lease at Primary Energys North Lake project expired in December 2002 and a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the project from the lessor for approximately $38.0 million. National Steel Corp. (National) receives electricity, steam and hot water from Primary Energys Portside project. On March 6, 2002, National filed for bankruptcy protection. Currently, National is evaluating its options for its agreements related to the Portside project. National has paid post petition fees due to date. Pre petition tolling and other fees not paid total $0.7 million. Additionally, Primary Energy has not received the air permit for which it filed in 1998. Although Primary Energy believes that issuance of the permit is imminent, it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to March 31, 2003 as required in the project financing agreements. Absent attainment of the air permit by the required date, the debt holders could cause acceleration of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding which is otherwise due at the end of 2003. Primary Energy is currently pursuing a waiver of the acceleration provision. The unamortized funding for the Portside project is $62.6 million. ACCOUNTING ISSUES. Most of the Primary Energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and Primary Energy subsidiaries act as the lessees. Prior to June 30, 2002, the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in NiSources consolidated financial statements, which treatment was approved by NiSources former independent public accountants. However, during the review of the second quarter 2002, NiSource determined in consultation with Deloitte & Touche, its independent public accountants, that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under EITF Issue No. 97 1, "Implementation Issues in Accounting for Lease Transactions, Including Those Involving Special Purpose Entities" (EITF No. 97 1) and EITF No. 97 10 "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction" (EITF No. 97 10). Certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions (Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed into service in early 2002 and Ironside, which was placed into service January 1, 2002), which were subject to EITF No. 97 10, could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee, resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects. Certain provisions in the other two leases (Cokenergy and Portside) could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments, resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases. As a result of this determination, NiSource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Subsequently, during the third quarter a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets related to Ironside and during the fourth quarter, a subsidiary of Primary Energy purchased the assets of another Primary Energy project (Northlake). Due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the Ironside and North Lake project assets, Primary Energy has recognized approximately $593.0 million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial. The recognition of the debt did not alter NiSources compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of NiSources credit ratings. For the single leased project not affected by EITF No. 97 1 and EITF No. 97 10, NiSource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements. However, due to the issuance of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," if the leasing structure remains unchanged, NiSource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The aggregate unamortized funding for the project at December 31, 2002 was $41.3 million. 42 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term.

The improvements were partly offset by an increase of $20.6 million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of $12.9 million in the value of the power trading portfolio, mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility. The Other segment reported an operating loss of $53.8 million in 2001 versus operating income of $80.4 million in 2000, reflecting the settlement of litigation related to MHP, the impact of winding down non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades, limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of $16.0 million related to the Enron bankruptcy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) LEASE INFORMATION. Primary Energy continues to lease four of the projects, three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance. NiSource, through Capital Markets, has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the Lessors, including regular lease payments, accelerated lease payments on an event of default, and payment obligations, including residual guarantee amounts, at the end of lease terms. In the case of an event of default, a Lessor can accelerate the full, unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. The aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at December 31, 2002 was $557.5 million. At the end of an initial lease term, the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the Lessors funding. If the Lessee cannot satisfy return conditions, the Lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price. If the Lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the Lessee can satisfy the return conditions, the Lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount. Since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term, the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term. The present value of a Lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90% of the amount advanced. The following table shows, by year, future minimum rental payments, including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases. Minimum Rental Additional ($ in millions) Payments Payment TOTAL 2003 114.6 114.6 2004 51.6 51.6 2005 51.1 51.1 2006 50.9 50.9 2007 49.4 49.4 After 435.4 105.1 540.5 In addition, a subsidiary of Primary Energy is a 50% partner in a partnership, which operates a coal pulverization facility. The partnership has entered into a lease of a 50% undivided interest in the facility. NiSource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease. Minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows: ($ in millions) 2003 6.2 2004 4.3 2005 4.3 2006 4.3 2007 4.3 After 15.2 In an event of default, the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease. This amount was $33.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Environmental Matters PRIMARY ENERGY. On June 26, 2002, EPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to three companies involved with a project at Ispat Inland Inc.s East Chicago, Indiana facility, including Primary Energys subsidiary, Cokenergy. The NOV alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the Clean Air Act. At issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997. Cokenergy representatives met with EPA in mid September 2002 to discuss the details of the allegations. At the September meeting, the EPA indicated they would issue a request for additional information, as well as provide substantiation for the NOV. No requests or information have come from the EPA. Cokenergy maintains its belief that the project 43 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. OTHER (CONTINUED) was properly permitted by the IDEM and, pending further discussion with EPA, cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred. In December 2002, Primary Energy received notice from IDEM that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for Cokenergys main stack desulfurization unit. IDEM is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of Lake County, Indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Until this rulemaking is finalized, Primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred. OTHER AFFILIATES. NiSource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane, petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies. Most significant environmental liability relates to former MGP sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations. The ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required, other PRPs and their financial viability, and indemnification from previous facility owners. Only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered "probable and reasonably estimable" under SFAS No. 5 and consistent with SOP No. 96 1. As costs become probable and reasonably estimable, reserves will be adjusted as appropriate. NiSource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations, for which it is ultimately liable, after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other PRPs, will not have a material adverse effect on NiSources financial position. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues of $79.1 million for 2002 decreased by $47.6 million from 2001. The decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from NiSources decision to scale back its gas trading business, the change in value of NiSources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of SM&P. Net operating revenues of $126.7 million for 2001 decreased by $72.5 million from 2000. This decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses, a mark to market loss on January East Coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business.
